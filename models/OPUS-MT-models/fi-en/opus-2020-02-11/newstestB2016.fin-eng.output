A 9-year-old boy on the run in Tampere was found.
The police have had a search mission on account of a nine-year-old boy's escape in Tampere on Tuesday evening.
A missing persons report has spread in social media about a boy who left West Tampere with a friend.
According to the police situation center, the boy has been contacted and has no danger to his life or health.
The boy's father told the Evening Sanomat at midnight knowing that the boy had been found.
He's fine, and now we're going to start the after-shaves.
The boy was found near the home, Dad told me.
Ronaldo, on the other hand, he's tearing the paint gap into Messi.
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league this weekend and continued his production in the Champions League as well.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo over the goal king of the Champions League turned at least for a moment in favor of the latter.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo went to the top of all-time scorer statistics when he shot the visitor Shahtar Donetsk's network with two hits on the penalty kicks and one on the game situation.
Ronaldo raised his goal balance to 80 when before Tuesday the Barcelona Messi, who was evenly read with him, had 77 hits.
Real won 4-0.
Juventus has stumbled in Italy's football league in Serie A from the beginning, but in the Champions League D section it started powerfully with a 2-1 visitor victory from Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored over ten minutes before the end of Juventus' Alvaro Morata.
City's attack was blunted by the absence of the knee-rugged Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in this weekend's champion league game, didn't come to the airport until the last ten minutes.
Manchester's second club, United, also experienced a tough time against PSV Endhoven in Holland after having suffered a 1-2 loss.
ManU's 20-year-old wingman Luke Shaw's guest fight lasted only 15 minutes.
The dangerous-looking slide tackle of PSV Hector Moreno hit the target with a ManU pack so badly that Shaw likely broke his tibia.
Shaw was lying on the lawn of Eindhoven's home stadium about ten minutes before medical personnel left to transport him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests to the 1-0 lead by 41 minutes, but ManU's pleasure lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno evened out before the break in extra time.
The PSV's winning goal was scored at the second half by Luciano Narsingh.
In the Champions League of the Marching Age, Paris Saint-Germain began the A-section.
It had been replaced by Angel Di Maria of Argentina, who changed Manchester United's shirt to a PSG nut.
Di Maria broke through the right hand and lifted the ball past the mantelpiece, Johan Wiland, the goalkeeper of Malmö.
Edinson Cavani made 2-0 for the second half of PSG.
PSG has been put on the team of season's winners.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of the league's small clubs, is not the best possible benchmark.
The PSG's star attacker Zlatan Ibrahimovic first encountered his professional career as his starting partner in Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played for 90 minutes when his team in Moscow's TsKA lost to Wolfsburg 0-1 in Section B in Germany.
The opposition party demanded immediate resignation - the president gave the wrong speech
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has given the same speech in the parliament that he gave at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether 91-year-old Mugabe was in full power.
The main opposition party, MDC, insisted that Mugabe resign because he is too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants rushed to say that the confusion had taken place only at Mugabe's headquarters and that the President had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech addressed earlier and now China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an extraordinary summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have proposed an additional summit of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President-in-Office of the European Council, will assess this request.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, state leaders should discuss cooperation with countries of origin and how to better register those who come to Europe.
The negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are, according to Merkel, part of the Home Secretary's table.
The professor admits he shot his girlfriend in an emergency call.
The university professor Shannon Lamb asked for a voice in an emergency call to shake the police in his home and said he shot his girlfriend.
Lamb specifically mentioned that their beloved dog was there and alive and probably scared. The professor told me that the contact details of the dead woman's family would be on her phone.
Inside the house, the police found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten note on a white document: "I'm very sorry and I wish I could undo what I did. I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," the letter signed by Lamb read according to the authorities.
There was no sign that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 500 kilometers to the school campus. The police found Ethan Schmidt, a professor of dead history who is believed to have been shot by Lamb on the campus at the door of his office.
Police Chief Lynn Buford of Delta State University noted that the university's authorities received information about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
According to him, Lamb made a fatal 911 call some time after this.
There was one more death in the day, and Lamb took his own life when the police caught him.
The day after the shootings, students and teaching staff remained behind locked doors, and the authorities were still trying to find out Lamb's motive.
The researchers explained the details in both localities, and the teachers who knew Lamb told about the man. The researchers gave a picture of a talented but perhaps problematic teacher.
The students always said they were looking forward to the professor's classes.
According to the Gautier Police Department of Prentiss' place of death, the professor had no prior history of violence or crime.
Schmidt, on the other hand, had mentioned Lamb in his book, which had acknowledged "the wonderful people" with whom he was allowed to live an academic life.
Both worked at the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose teaching staff included 17 people. Many of the students participated in both men's courses.
However, reference was made to the problems.
The student Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said that the professor seemed upset and nervous, "as if he had something wrong".
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told him at the end of the academic year 2014-2015 that he was suffering from stress.
Lamb had previously applied to Delta State University for sick leave because of some kind of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's payroll policy meant that the doctoral dissertation for which Lamb had worked hard would not automatically guarantee him assistant professorship.
William LaForge, the university's principal, explained that he was not aware of the contradictions between Lamb and Schmidt, but stated that something was clearly bothering Lamb.
These are the questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After leaving campus, the police found out what route Lamb had taken from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before the police reached Lamb, he had taken his life with a 38-caliber pistol in the backyard of the house in Greenville, Mississippi, about a mile from his parents' home, M. Methel Johnson of Washington County reported.
Lamb's car was still running in the driveway.
The police didn't immediately find out why Lamb had gone to this very house, but Johnson said he believed that the man knew the people in the house.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb started work as a teacher in geography and education at a university with 3,500 students. The city had 12,000 inhabitants in 2009 .
In the spring, he received a doctorate in educational science.
One of Lamb's longest friends described this as intelligent, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston told me she met Lamb through mutual friends when she was 15 and Lamb 20.
He and his friends were still in high school, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who spent years trying to teach Hairston how to play guitar.
"Lamb was quite a heartbreaker back then.
All the girls were in love with him," said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Brandon, a suburb of Jackson.
Apparently Lamb and Prentiss had been seeing each other for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb told me he killed his wife, but according to no document, they were not married.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, and they lived in a brick house in a river estuary in Gautier's small town.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss's ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, told me he divorced Prentiss 15 years ago.
"He was shocked," O'Steen said about his daughter.
"The daughter and mother were best friends."
O'Steen had not met Lamb but heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb liked music and played blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail both performed at a summer event three years ago.
Later, they also played together at times.
According to O'Steen, his daughter is composing and performing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies online.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and part-time entertainment coordinator at the modest The Julep Room restaurant outside Gautier, reported seeing Lamb and Prentiss on September 5, after Lamb had played guitar and harp to a few audiences.
There was nothing to say that something was wrong.
"Happy couple," Shaffer said.
"We used to joke together.
Both had a good sense of humor."
"Professor Schmidt, who received his grief, directed first-year seminars and specialized in Indian and colonial history," said Don Allan Mitchell, English professor.
She was married, and she had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was chairman of his own brotherhood and student union.
On the Delta State University campus in Cleveland, 900 people gathered for the memorial in candlelight, including teaching staff, other staff, students and residents of the area.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a nightly event where the University Choir performed the songs "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The lesson continues on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get the students back," LaForge said.
"The crisis is over.
This is a healing day."
Amy and Rogelio Solis are reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Assistant editors: Associated Press editors Emily Wagster Pettus Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana New Orleans.
The case has been corrected because the police are now telling us that Lamb made an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and it was also specified that while Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us does not intend to hire as many seasonal workers as it did last year. However, the dealer of toys and baby products says that he will offer his current employees and seasonal workers the opportunity for additional hours.
The company plans to hire 40 000 people to store and distribution centres across the country. In 2014, it hired 45 000 seasonal workers.
Most jobs are part-time.
Interviews with applicants will start this month, and new employees will start in October–December.
Although the holiday season is still months away, the trade season is approaching at a good pace, and companies are preparing by hiring temporary staff for shops and goods delivery and delivery.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his date with Princess Diana.
The premiere of the "Back to the Future" film was an important moment for Michael J. Fox's career.
The premiere also had a personal significance.
"We sat in the theater and waited for the royals to arrive. I noticed that there was an empty place next to me. It dawned on me that Princess Diana is coming next to me," Fox told me about the trailer of the upcoming Back in Time document.
"When the movie started, I realized that the situation was very similar to a date with the Princess of Wales."
The Back in Time document is related to Back to the Future films, and the documentary will also interview Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd as well as director Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg.
The "Back to the Future" movie got its premiere 30 years ago.
"This film is definitely an all-time time travel film for me," Spielberg said.
Back in Time will be published in VOD and DVD format and will be shown in selected cinemas from October onwards.
UN Secretary-General: no military solution in Syria
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, commented on Russia's intensified military action and stated that there was no military solution to the almost five-year conflict and that arms would only bring more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The Secretary-General again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to join forces and support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Ban announced plans to meet five permanent members of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France, to discuss the situation in Syria, which would take place in the margins of the UN General Assembly ministerial week later this month.
Mr Ban regretted that the fragmentation of the Security Council, the Syrian people and regional powers had created an impossible situation.
In the context of the Syrian crisis, Mr Ban called on the five permanent Member States to show the same solidarity and unity that achieved the Iran nuclear agreement.
Chapter 8 of the polls: Is Donald Trump serious?
They've been trying to label Trump as an idler.
He's also been considered a joke.
Some of us are predicting a collapse for Trump.
In Republican circles (for now) every effort has been made to pull Trump down from the polls.
Ten out of eleven national polls are showing Donald Trump double-digit support numbers, and some are already seriously considering what it actually says about the potential candidates for the real estate mogul.
However, the elections are still at an early stage.
There's been no announcement yet that Trump will be elected Republican candidate.
Experts remind us that Rick Perry, who was present at this time in 2011, was allowed to give space to the rising Herman Cain. Neither of them finally won the candidate election in any state.
Trump would, for many reasons, be difficult in a general election.
External factions, such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Economic Conservative Club for Growth, have noted Trump's strong position and started digging for his fall.
The following recent Gallup data indicate that the real estate mogul cannot be ignored by a shoulder wound:
There's been a turnaround in Trump's support.
Just before Trump announced that he would run for office in mid-June, according to the Montmouth University Gallup, only two out of ten Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, 40% had a positive image.
At the beginning of August, the corresponding proportion was 52 per cent.
Now six out of ten Republicans have a positive image of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten people have a negative image.
These figures are also held in the Länder, where elections are held first.
In last week's Quinnipiac gallup, 60% of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of the Republicans would be happy with Trump's candidacy.
Last week at CNN and ORC Gallup, 67% of the Republicans said that they were very satisfied or satisfied with Trump's possible choice as a candidate.
Only two out of ten would be very unhappy with Trump's candidacy.
Ben Carson receives almost as much enthusiasm as Trump (43% would be very satisfied with Carson's candidacy and 40% with Trump's candidacy).
Who's the next most popular candidate?
The third is Marco Rubio, with a 21% share of support.
On the other hand, 47% of the Republicans would be unhappy or very unhappy if Jeb Bush were elected as a candidate for the party.
Most Republicans don't find Trump's temper problematic.
Donald Trump has been widely criticised for his pompous and offensive comments. 52 percent of Republican supporters all over the country consider the properties of the real estate mogul to be suitable for the president. Views are shown in ABC News and Washington Post's opinion polls.
The same figure applies to Iowa, where the convention is held first: according to the Quinnipiac Gallup, 52% of the Republicans consider Trump's personal qualities to be suitable for the Chief of Defense.
However, according to ABC and Post's Gallup, 44% consider Trump to be unable to function effectively, and six out of ten consider Trump's temper to be inappropriate for the White House.
The Republicans are getting used to the idea.
They're starting to take Trump seriously.
When the Republicans are asked who is most likely to be elected as a candidate for the party, according to CNN and ORC Gallup, four out of ten believe in Trump's chances.
The situation has changed since mid-July, when four out of ten would have put their money on Jeb Bush's side.
As a whole: Republicans have never had a very reliable crystal ball at their disposal before.
At this point in the last election, four out of ten Republicans considered Rick Perry a likely candidate, and only 28% of Mitt Romney.
The majority seem to think Trump's campaign is convincing.
Even if the Republicans support the other candidate, Trump will defeat almost all the other candidates.
Some experts consider that a divided camp is likely to benefit Trump when the opponents of Trump are divided into supporters of different candidates.
At the beginning of September, a poll at Monmouth University revealed that Trump would almost always have a larger support group in an imaginary duplication between Trump and almost any other Republican candidate.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and Rand Paul by 33 points each.
With Ted Cruz, he's even.
Is Cruz Trump's only real opponent?
Ben Carson would win Trump by a 19-point difference in imaginary double-crossing.
A small majority of Trump's supporters are already saying that they have taken a vote.
According to a poll published by CBS and NYT on Tuesday, more than half of Trump's supporters are convinced of their vote.
Of course, the situation can change for a number of reasons, and at the moment a certain voter can also change his mind.
46% of Trump's supporters have not made a final decision.
Trump's biggest competitor at the moment is neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who have already elected their candidates are twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans agree with Trump's view of immigration.
Since Donald Trump was invited to speak in his campaign speech two months ago, immigrants from Mexico as rapists have been a hot topic for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's pompous speeches banish important Latin American voters from Republican forces and hinder the renewal of the brand.
However, according to the results of ABC News and Washington Post on Monday, six out of ten Republicans are in line with Trump on migration issues.
As long as immigration is in the spotlight, so is Donald Trump.
Discontent with the regime is at its peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are currently collecting about half the votes of Republicans, and the popularity is significantly increased by the fact that both have been nominated as outsiders.
The Republican troops want to run for office instead of running for politics, and according to ABC News and Washington Post's latest poll, six out of ten Republicans thought so.
These two candidates are also angry with Washington.
According to a poll conducted by Des Moines Register and Bloomberg in Iowa, three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by Republican activity in Congress: 54% are unhappy and 21% on the verge of rage."
Jeremy Corby's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time
After the election, Corbyn's first appearance at Prime Minister's Question Time has been eagerly awaited.
Labour Labour's new front picture Jeremy Corbyn is due to rise for the first time at David Cameron's Question Time later.
Corbyn will ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, and the media and the Labour Party will be watching him with their eyes open.
Corby's been calling for less theater and more facts for the weekly show.
He has also said that he can skip some of the sessions and leave them to his colleagues.
At the meeting, Corbyn's leadership will be weighed for the first time in connection. Corbyn will now be subjected to parliamentary testing after the gathering of the shadow government and after his speech at the annual meeting of the Corbyn Trade Union Confederation (TUC) on Tuesday.
Labour's decision to remain silent during the national anthem at the 75th anniversary of the British Air War on Tuesday has been criticised by several Tory Party representatives and has also reached the headlines of several newspapers.
Corbyn's silence during the National Anthem caught attention
Corbyn's representative noted that Corbyn stood during the national anthem, respecting in silence the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle for Britain.
However, in the BBC's Two's Newsnight programme, Owen Smith, a shadow government member of Corbyn, said that he would have invited the party leader to join the national anthem despite the anti-monarchy.
Ten or so shadow ministers have refused to join Corbyn's first team, citing differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs. Less than one-sixth of the party originally supported Corbyn's election to the party leadership.
The BBC policy correspondent, Robin Brant, considers that political disagreements on British membership of the EU and on the terms and conditions for granting benefits have accumulated in the Labour Party since the appointment of Corbyn.
At the meeting of the TUC, Corbyn stated that Labour was going to propose amendments to remove the restrictions altogether.
Hours later, Mr Smith, Minister for Employment and Pensions of the shadow government, said that the party's position is very clear: it is opposed only to the government's plans to lower the limit from 26 000 to 23 000 pounds.
Corbyn is the fifth Labour leader to be met by David Cameron over the past decade by Tory.
The Labour Director, who promised a new policy approach, says that he has chosen the questions he would like to ask Cameron about the 30 000 proposals he received from the public.
According to Corbyn, elected from the constituency of Islington North, there are too many clashes at Question Time, and he promises to avoid witty words and mud-throwing and instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Corbyn has noted that shadow minister Angela Eagle is filling in for him during Question Time, for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corbyn has also thrown out the idea that others could sometimes also come out and talk about it with John Bercow, President of the House of Commons.
After Corbyn joined the party leadership in 2005, Cameron stated that he wanted puppet theatre-like politics, which is often associated with Question Time, but some years later he admitted that he had failed in his quest.
Since Question Time was first televised in 1990, it has been seen as a key measure of the Director's judgment, of the control of the House of Commons and of the position, but according to critics, Question Time has become a caricature that needs major reforms.
"Shot in Joburg": From homeless to young photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a challenging environment for the homeless.
A meaningful way to learn and make money has been found for the group of former street children.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit film studio where homeless young people are taught to photograph their country and earn at the same time.
BBC News met a young person who has graduated through the project among the first.

The pound will increase as British wages rise
The pound was strengthened by the increase in wages in the UK, and SABMiller drew the FTSE 100 index.
In May to July, wages and salaries in the United Kingdom rose by 2.9 per cent compared to the corresponding period last year.
The faster growth than predicted was the fastest since 2009.
The pound was strengthened by 1 per cent and its rate was quoted at $1.5505. The pound was also strengthened in relation to the euro and quoted at €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose by 1.49 per cent and reached 6.229.21 points.
The biggest increase was made by SABMiller, which was in pain by 20 % when the company received a preliminary bid from the competing company AB InBev.
The transaction would bring together the two largest brewing companies in the world and would bring under the same roof brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 per cent in the wake of the positive results of the competing Richemont group focusing on luxury products.
Richemont's most recent sales figures are better than forecast. Sales development was also leading to a rise in Burberry's key market in China.
Glencore's share rose by 5 per cent from its announced intention to raise $2.5 billion in the share issue as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The packaging and paper group Mondi's shares were the biggest fall by 4.3 per cent when Goldman Sachs dropped the company's share price for the purpose of selling.
The JD Sports price rose by 3.1% after the sports company announced that its pre-tax return would increase by 83% to GBP 46.6 million.
JD Sports boss: higher wage spending could hamper expansion
According to Peter Cowgill, Chairman of JD Sports Management Team, raising the minimum wage in the UK would mean more purchasing power for potential customers.
However, increased purchasing power is not sufficient to cover higher labour costs for the company.
According to Cowgill, the increase in labour costs could jeopardise JD Sports' expansion plans and reduce the need for additional labour.
Metcash launches a grass roots campaign against Aldi's landslide
Metcash aims to secure its IGA store from Aldi's claim in southern and western Australia.
The food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to maintain the market share of IGA retailers in South and West Australia against the Aldin $700 million invasion of Australia.
Aldi plans to open two distribution centres and the first of up to 120 stores in South and West Australia at the beginning of next year. Metcast and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build IGA brand by marketing in mainstream media and social media and by organising events such as Adelaide.
IGA stores and suppliers as well as many brands are involved in the campaign. For example, the Dunsborough Ice Cream Factory Simmo offers samples at IGA stores, and merchants sell tickets to regulars for football games in South Australia at a discount price.
Metcash is expected to publish more detailed information on its defence strategy on 29 September, when the food, alcohol and iron trade wholesale organises an annual investment strategy day.
This is a significant market, since South and West Australia account for almost 30% of the footprint of Metcash's IGA stores, and in these areas the margin yield is higher than that of the Eastern Länder' IGA network.
South and West Australian consumers are well known for being cornered, and IGA traders in the region have a much higher market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. South Australia has a market share of 30% and Western Australia 24%, while Eastern states have a market share of only 14%.
For example, Morgan Stanley's analysts believe that Aldi will capture 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores.
This week, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimates that the sales of IGA traders can be sold for 360 million and Metcashi for 250 million dollars by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South and West Australia next year and will reach $500 million and $600 million in these areas.
Metcash's fixed costs are high, so the loss of food sales and volumes can mean a loss of $13 million in profit before interest and taxes," says Kierath.
At the same time, Metcast is losing market share in eastern states mainly to Aldi and Coles, although according to a recent study by Roy Morgan, IGA's customers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018. Its market share would fall from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10,3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, the lead portfolio manager of Magellan Financial Group, said at an event in Melbourne that he was very likely to disappear altogether within ten years.
Metcash has refused to take a public view of Douglass' comments.
It is understandable that a member of Metcash's board contacted Douglass last week.
Since 2010, IGA's market share has fallen from 18% to 14%, while the food business of 1,200 IGA retailers, Metcash, has decreased by 43 per cent from 2012 levels, showing a reduction in debt financing in the face of pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesale operator takes countermeasures and makes an annual investment of more than $150 million in response to Coles and Woolworths prices for hundreds of products every week. The chain wants to support traders in the reform of stores so that they can increase the supply of fresh products and improve the food supply of their own brands.
According to Metcash's CEO, Ian Morrice, price review and store reform plans are well under way, and the company will be able to increase its profit again in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Steve Healy, president of the Australian tennis union, defends Thanasi Kokkinak
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves a special mention of his conduct instead of criticism.
According to Steve Healy, president of the Australian tennis association, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a collateral victim in the recent Nick Kyrgios-related business, and Kokkinakis deserves a special mention instead of criticism.
The younger party of the "special K" duo, Kokkinakis, was caught in an unfavorable spotlight when the bad boy Kyrgios provoked his opponent Stan Wawrinka in the Montreal ATP tournament.
Soon after that, in the Cincinnati game between Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison, the judge had to separate the competitors twice. "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgiosis and my friend," Harrison said.
In the open U.S., Kokkinakis frustratedly struck a bat in the field when strong cramps ruined his fight. Healy has faithfully defended Kokkinaki.
At the moment, a teenage star is in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth for the second place behind the single-player Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinal against Great Britain.
"I strongly believe that Thanasi has been drawn into the dispute," Healy said.
"He broke the bat when he lost the match in the open in the United States. He is by no means the first player to break his bat because of frustration. I know Thanas well enough not to be proud of what he did.
However, he has endured very well, for example, Harrison's provocative behaviour in the open in the United States, and I think he deserves recognition.
He's got a strong team and a great family around him, and I just think he's been treated a little unfairly.
He is very mature to be 19 years old, he works hard and complements the team well. He has never had problems with other players, and he is respected among the players. He practises hard, is in good condition and a very stable and mature young man. I think he should be judged on his own merits."
Healy also supported the decision to drop Kyrgios from the Australian team from the important round beginning as a Friday. Healy describes the solution as a joint decision that works for all parties. However, he supports the return of Canberra's educator to the long-term confirmation of the team.
"First of all, we want to focus fully on the fights instead of the Kyrgios-related polemic," Healy said.
Nick has risen to the top quickly. As Federer and Murray have pointed out, the young man is growing up in the spotlight of publicity. He deserves the criticism of his gross mistakes. However, we strive to support him in understanding the consequences of his actions. We also try to arrange for his own peace. I believe it is best for both the whole team and Nick."
European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
Hungary, which declared a state of emergency, closed its southern border from the direction of Serbia on Tuesday and seized illegal immigrants with the aim of preventing the influx of migrants.
There was chaos on the border when hundreds of immigrants piled up in a non-man's country, and the Serbian authorities reacted furiously.
People fleeing violence had to stay on the road between country checkpoints for an indeterminate period of time in their tents
Frustration began to surface.
While the police helicopter was flying in the air over the immigrants, they were saying, "Open the border!" and they were shouting insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some became protesters of the eating and drinking strike.
The Serbian Foreign Minister stated that it did not accept that migrants should be sent back to Hungary at the same time as more people arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not to increase the damage.
The situation will need to be discussed in Brussels and in other countries in the next few days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
A day later, on the Hungarian-Serbia border, Kuohun began, when a group of 28 countries failed in their efforts to develop a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed, however, that 40 000 asylum seekers in Italy and Greece have a shared responsibility, and the hope arose that an agreement would be reached by next month or by the end of the year on which EU Member States would accept 120 000 migrants, including Hungary.
Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened an extraordinary summit on Tuesday for the next week to discuss the continent's immigrant crisis.
However, Hungary did not express its hope for urgent action by Brussels or neighbouring countries.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation developed so that the authorities in the two southern regions were allowed to use more effective means, i.e. to close roads and speed up judicial processes in the area of asylum.
At the same time, Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that Hungary is also planning a barbed wire fence at the Romanian border to prevent the flow of migrants from that direction, now that a fence is already in place at the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners participated in the tender for the finalisation of barbed wire fences between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear bottleneck for migrants and a transit point to the European Union, many of which are refugees from Syria and the rest of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban claimed that most of the people arriving are living standards refugees, not war refugees, who have the right to seek protection, and the view is radically different from that of other EU countries, including Germany.
The new law, which entered into force at midnight in Hungary, states that it is a crime to cross or damage a four-metre-high barbed wire fence built by the government on the southern border towards Serbia, which also defines longer prison periods for convicted traffickers.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the government declares a state of crisis in the country", the government's spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told journalists in the city of Szeged in the south of the country.
"We are following a strict line: illegal border crossing is a crime."
In practice, Parliament still needs to adopt military action, which is expected next week, and the journalists of the Associated Press on the border have been seeing heavy-armed soldiers with their vehicles and military dogs for several days now.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's internal security adviser, explained that 45 cross-border attempts were taken by the authorities immediately at the border and 15 further away.
People crossing the border by damaging the fence are now in the hands of the police, charged with crimes under new laws.
The authorities are quick to repair the fence.
In addition, two of the seven border crossing points on the border with Serbia were closed by the Hungarian authorities on Tuesday; one border crossing point was closed by means of a railway wagon covered with barbed wire.
Chaos took over the main border crossing near Roszke in Hungary when Hungarians opened a point of contact in a small metal container where people packed in.
About 20 could fit in, but thousands were left out.
Another group of migrants blocked the main street linking Serbia and Hungary, and people announced that they were on a eating and drinking strike until they were allowed into Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's leadership against Bernie Sanders contracted half by national poll
The support rate for former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton is still double-digit in the race for the national presidential candidate for the Democrats, but Senator Bernie Sanders has reached an end to the distance.
Mr Clinton's support now stands at 47% of the votes cast by the democratic supporters (down from 58%) while Mr Sanders is second in favour of 27% (up from 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced his possible departure into the presidential race, and his support among the Democrats is 15%.
More than five months before the primary elections, it is too early for most Democrats to tell which candidate they are in favour of.
Clinton's supporters, however, are more sure of their choice than those of other candidates.
Since the poll commissioned by CBS News last month, Clinton has lost the support of several democratic groups, while new supporters have joined the Sanders camp.
Clinton still has a strong leadership among women and moderates, but the leadership has narrowed.
Clinton's support among men has dropped significantly and has only a 5% bow over Sanders.
Clinton has lost leadership among the Democrats under 50 and is now even with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a clear advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton's head start in favor of the Sanders liberals was two figures, but now Sanders has taken a five percentage point neck to Clinton in this group.
About half of the Democrats will be happy to support Clinton if he is elected as a candidate for the party.
A quarter would support Clinton with minor reservations, and 15% would support him simply because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support Clinton.
It is no surprise that Clinton's current supporters would also be particularly enthusiastic if they were elected.
There is more dispersion among those who are not currently in favour of Clinton, and only about a quarter of them would be eager to support him.
Forty-eight per cent of democratic voters would support Clinton, while only 35 per cent of Republican voters would enthusiastically support Donald Trump, the most popular Republican candidate.
When the voters of Clinton are asked to describe freely why they are in favour of his candidacy, the most popular argument is the correct experience of Clinton (16%). Secondly, the most popular answer is that it is time to elect a female president (13%) and, thirdly, that Clinton is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
There is also a reference to common views and opportunities to win the actual elections.
The vice-president is still considering his possible candidacy, and 57% of the Democratic voters would like him to join the race, while the third would prefer to leave him out of the race.
When the second most popular candidate is asked to be a candidate for the party, the majority chooses Biden.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half of Biden is the second most popular candidate since Clinton and considerably more popular than Sanders.
If Biden doesn't go to the Democratic candidate race, Hillary Clinton will increase his head start with Sanders. With Sanders, the head start is 20 percentage points, and it will increase to 30 percentage points if Sanders doesn't go to the race.
55% of democratic voters consider Clinton to be the candidate with the best chance of winning the actual elections, but the figure has fallen from 78% last month.
Biden, who is number two, is far from Clinton, but more and more people believe that Biden can win the actual election.
However, democratic voters attach greater importance to the views on matters of substance than to the chances of candidates winning.
The voters do not find it unacceptable to accept any of the democratic candidates or potential candidates.
The voters consider the democratic candidates or potential candidates to be appropriate in terms of their characteristics.
Most people think Clinton, Sanders and Biden are honest, reliable and leader types.
Biden is most often described as being honest, while Clinton is most often regarded as a leader type.
As many as 30% of democratic voters do not regard Clinton as honest and reliable, and 15% of Sanders does. 27% do not know whether Sanders is honest.
Democratic voters believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden's views are close to their own ideology.
There's no opinion on Sanders for all properties in about a quarter.
When the voters are asked for views on the use of Hillary Clinton's private e-mail and its own server as Foreign Minister, most of the democrats say that they are satisfied with Clinton's explanation and that it has not changed their view of Clinton.
The Americans in the wider world disagree.
Half the Americans are unhappy with Clinton's report, and only one third are satisfied.
The public's opinions were divided in March, when the conflict had just come out.
The majority of Americans believe that the controversial use of e-mail has not affected their overall picture of Clinton. 36 percent say that the image has changed in a negative direction.
Of this 36%, most, six out of ten, are Republicans.
Although the voters of their own party consider Clinton to be honest and reliable, there is room for improvement in these qualities when you ask for the views of all voters: Clinton is considered honest and reliable by only 32%, which is 8 percentage points less than last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
62% of all voters do not consider Clinton to be honest and reliable.
On the other hand, 55% of all voters in the country do not consider Trump to be honest and reliable either.
But both Clinton and Trump get good grades for leadership.
Of the six candidates in the survey, Biden, Carson and Bush were considered the most reliable.
The majority think Sanders is honest, but like Carson, many people don't have an opinion on Sanders.
The sample is 351 voters and the margin of error is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson's catching Donald Trump's head start in the National Support Survey
According to CBS News and the latest poll in the New York Times, Ben Carson has reached Donald Trump.
These two candidates took over half the votes in the new survey and left the other candidates far behind.
Among the Republican voters in the whole country, Trump still has strong support. The support rate has risen from 23% of the CBS survey conducted last month by Fox News. According to a survey published on Tuesday, the support rate is 27%.
However, Carson's support would trigger a huge increase in the same period, from 6% to 23%.
According to the survey, Carson has strong support for all the population groups, and in a group of highly educated people, he's close enough to beat Trump.
The other candidates, except Carly Fiorina and Governor John Kasich of Ohio, remain far behind, and the support of Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin is the weakest and has fallen from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, and Senator Marco Rubio to Florida shared the third place with 6% support.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters is 6% one way or the other. The survey was conducted in September.
According to the latest survey published by CNN and ORC last week, Carson's support is rising, with 19% of the Republicans supporting him, compared with 32% of Trump's.
Also in the latest survey by ABC News and Washington Post, Trump was clearly ahead of Carson.
In a man-to-man encounter last week, Trump made false accusations to a retired neurosurgeon, but Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said on Saturday during his campaign in Iowa.
Five members on trial for the death of a freshman at Baruch College.
Almost two years ago, five people are charged with murder after the death of a student in a frat ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania.
The members of the Pi Delta Ps District of Baruch College (City University of New York) brutally abused Chun "Michael" Deng at the baptism in September 2013. According to the police, Deng was not delivered to the hospital in time, which was considered contributing to his death.
According to the authorities, the victim's eyes were blindfolded, had been placed on his back with a pack of sand almost 15 kg, and had been attacked repeatedly in an attempt to reach an object placed across an icy field.
Deng is reported to have complained of a headache and then passed out.
According to the police, members of Pi Delta Ps didn't call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, allegedly waiting an hour before Deng was taken to the hospital.
Commissioner Chris Wabner told us at the press conference that the members were still able to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms and contact the student president, Andy Meng.
"At this point, members began to hide the instruments, putting the benefit of the cooperative before Michael Deng's health," Wagner said.
Deng couldn't be revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng had been struck several times in the head, torso, and thighs with blunt force trauma.
"Too many families have been shocked by the student's impregnation, as at least one student a year has died as a result of the impregnation since 1970," says Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
The cooperatives and their members must be held accountable where the authorities must take an important step.
Monroe County's grand jury presented five members of the community to be charged with murder in the third degree.
In addition, 32 members will be charged with impregnation and criminal conspiracy, including Meng.
"We want to be responsible not only for individuals, but also for the organisation that officially or informally approved the impregnation," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College imposed a ban on the association, and the national cooperative resigned from the local branch.
In this way, the increase in interest rates of the Federal Reserve (Fed) will have an impact on:
The rise in interest rates and the stock market are faltering, securities returns are rising and the economy is slipping into recession.
That's what we know.
On the other hand, we do not know how long everything will take and how long the effects will last.
With regard to the economy in particular, we find in history an indication of timing.
The recession has arrived up to 11 months after the first increase in interest rates and lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank is often aggressively raising interest rates, although not always. The decisive factor is how the economy and financial resources react.
That is why the officials of the Central Bank have been so stressed that investors should pay no attention to the fact that interest rates start to increase, but to how long it will take to normalise the situation.
There are, of course, a number of variables involved.
In the end, however, market players can see that all the fuss about raising interest rates can be exaggerated.
"The central bank's first withdrawal after the global financial crisis was undoubtedly interpreted as a sign of the end of cheap money," Julian Jessop, Chief Economics chief global economist told his customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect a gradual normalisation of interest rates at a relatively low level, which is a frightening seismic shock for many.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here are examples based on historical trends of how impacts can be reflected in different economic areas:
As has been seen on the market for about a month now, the omens of interest increases instability for some time.
When interest rates finally rise, the effect is not so dramatic.
"Trend seems to be the halting of interest income on capital after the first increase for 12 to 24 months, perhaps reflecting the delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank's analyst in a recent study of the consequences of the increase in interest rates.
In the 35-year period, the market generally sees a sharp increase at the time of the increase in interest rates, about 14 per cent, fairly steady for the next 250 days (average increase of 2.6 per cent), after 500 days the situation normalises, and the average interest rate return after six stock cycles is 14,4 per cent, says Bob Doll, in Nuveen's Chief Equity strategist Barron's magazine.
According to Deutsche, the impact on the shares will generally increase at a slightly later stage of the cycle and interest income will start to decrease.
The recession is a fact in the economy, but the rise in interest rates usually works on it.
In this case, if the central bank encounters circumstances that did not exist before and could accelerate the downturn.
It is particularly noteworthy that GDP is at its lowest ever in view of raising the central bank's central bank's steering interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, 118 interest rates have been raised since 1950, only twice has the nominal value been below 4.5%.
Although the second quarter of 2015 shows 3.6 per cent, many did not imagine it would last, and the third quarter is 1.5%," says Atlanta Regional Central Bank.
In raising interest rates in such a sensitive economic situation, there may be risks and one might ask whether this situation is different," Deutsche said.
The market players have been talking about raising the steering rate throughout the year, and they are looking at this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
Many strategists and economists believe that even if the open market committee approves the withdrawal at this meeting, futures trade will only show a 25% probability.
"In our studies since 1950, all the withdrawal cycles up to today have been in a supercycle, where GDP falling before the recession is rising very rapidly since the start of the economic upturn", says the report.
Recovery has been very slow compared to the worst depression of the control period.
The cycle is clearly the longest that the Central Bank has been waiting for since the last recession. The record had been 35 months, now it's already going to be 74 months.
Fixed-yield securities have also been unstable in the outlook for interest rates, and the formula is repeated on the capital side.
"The underlying difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than on shares when the central bank changes the rate.
In the case of bonds, the yield appears to change direction immediately upon the start of the first rise/down cycle.
At the end of the upturn cycle, profits will fall immediately", Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that raising interest rates will make long-term and short-term bonds approach each other and smooth the curve.
"In such an environment, high-income bonds often fare better, even though we are still cautious about returns," said Kathy Jones, the analyst on fixed-income securities in Schwab.
Fascinatingly enough, according to Jones, the market has already adapted to the future change in the direction of the Central Bank.
"In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and inflation forecasts, there are already a number of signs of adjustment to the tightening of financial policy," says Jones.
Short-term interest rates are rising, the yield curve is direct, credit risk margins have expanded and volatility has increased.
To a large extent, companies operating mainly in the US market will benefit from lower interest rates and local products will become attractive.
The outlook for the indebted multinationals is weaker, as a stronger dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market and debt more expensive.
"History shows that quality shares are more profitable in the next three months," Goldman Sachs analysts inform their customers.
The companies with a strong balance sheet overcame the weak balance sheet after the interest rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of five percentage points.
Non-financial corporations with high return on capital and low volatility shares also did better than quality, on average 4 and 3 percentage points respectively.
"Police is a big question.
Companies with a significant share of variable interest rate debt lose most," Goldman said.
Outside the stock market, consumers also generally benefit from the strengthening of the dollar.
The savers also benefit from higher returns, although experts disagree with the speed with which the effects can be seen.
Parliamentary Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM
Conservative Andrew Bingham criticized the radio station for overpopulating.
According to Bingham, the channel is now difficult to distinguish from its commercial competitor.
Also claims that the BBC Music Awards are only a copy of the Brits Awards.
Parliamentary Assembly Damien Collins, on the other hand, accuses the Voice channel of impersonality.
According to a prominent parliamentarian, BBC Radio 3 is gradually turning into a copy of the Classic FM channel, which increases the pressure on the station to prove that it offers other commercial radio stations.
Conservative Andrew Bingham also told BBC management that the broadcaster's radio channel is becoming too populist and that the channel is no longer much different from its commercial competitor.
"I don't want to talk about popularisation, but Radio 3 seems to be changing in the direction of Classic FM," Bingham said.
The BBC Music Awards, held last December, also receive criticism from Bingham:
"The BBC Music Awards held for the first time last year appear to be a replica of the Brits Awards.
These two are examples of a mere imitation of what is already on the market instead of new and different," says Bingham.
The Director-General of BBC denied the allegations and stated that BBC Radio 3 offers much more live music and enlightening content than a commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 taught me something about classical music that I can't learn from other channels.
The channel's commitment to live music and music is in its own class.
I also think it is important that Radio 3 is also committed to finding new music and ordering new works," said the Director-General.
Earlier this year, the director of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, said that the station must work harder to maintain public interest, as the British know classical music better than ever.
However, Radio 3 is not the only BBC channel that received criticism for entering the territory of the hard commercial channels, in consultation with the restricted Committee on Culture, the Media and Sport.
Tory MP Damien Collins criticised the "The Voice" talent-searching contest that the BBC purchased from the Dutch producer Talpa Media, which is estimated at £22 million.
"The programme is not much discussed because it is not unique or particularly distinctive."
According to Lord Hall, the programme presented by BBC1, as star judges Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced in a manner typical of BBC.
Collins also demanded that the company look for a hit show in its own garage when it next launches a new entertainment series.
However, Mr Collins refused to exclude the fact that the Voice series would continue to be ordered or that taxpayers' money would be used for other forms of entertainment.
The growth of online commerce at the slowest ever in August – perhaps due to black Friday
In the first months of 2015, online trade grew by seven per cent.
The sales of e-commerce have been recorded since 2000 and last month the growth was the slowest ever.
The online store was strengthened three years ago with mobile purchases.
Experts believe that a black Friday of November can control buying desires.
For more than ten years, the conquest of the online store has devastated many of Britain's shopping streets.
According to experts, there are indications that e-commerce is on the right track and new sales figures show only a 7 % increase in the first three months of 2015.
In August, the growth in total sales was slowest throughout the period when online sales have been recorded, i.e. since 2000. Last year, online sales grew by only five per cent.
According to experts, there are indications that e-commerce is on the right track and new sales figures show only a 7 % increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If you compare last year's growth with the figures for 2000, it is clear that growth will stabilise over time," Andy Mulcahy, IMRG's editor-in-chief, told Guardian.
According to Mulcahy, the online store accelerated three years ago when consumers adopted mobile purchasing.
"As a result, more and more people were able to buy online, and for many people it was possible to buy in a different environment, even from a home sofa.
As mobile purchasing is now more moderate, growth can stabilise."
Black Friday from America is a phenomenon that is seen as one of the causes of the slowdown in growth.
According to experts, the last Friday of November may cause consumers to postpone the purchase decision before black Friday.
Last year, five times as many online buyers as normal caused many traders' websites to fall.
Experts believe that the black Friday, which causes consumers to crowd in on offers, can curb the desire to buy at other times.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, a good pound for every five pounds was spent online.
More than one third of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, are purchased online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of shopping for fashion shops.
Mecca burys the victims of crane accidents, the Bin Laden family responsible
The Muslims carried the bodies of 29 victims on the streets when the first funeral took place in Mecca.
According to Saudi Arabia, the big construction company Saudi Binladin Group is a part of the blame for the accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were also injured when the crane fell.
The bodies were carried up high in the air as Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the crane that fell on Mecca's Grand Mosque.
On their last journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery, a crowd of white-dressed people had gathered on the streets to say good-bye to the victims.
The sorrow convoy traveled to a pilgrimage site, where the fallen crane had only a day earlier penetrated the mosque's roof over the Muslims.
The king of Saudi Arabia claims that Bin Laden's construction family business should be held responsible for the accident, which also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 victims who died in the Mecca Grand Mosque crane accident were transported on the streets.
After the crane fell among the dead was Qasim Akram of Bolton, the Great Manchester, who had traveled to Mecca on his first pilgrimage.
Akram had been in the Great Mosque with his parents who were starting their annual Hajj pilgrimage.
The Saudi authorities have promised that the Hajj pilgrimage will take place when thousands of people are arriving in the city for pilgrimage.
According to King Salman, Binladin Group should not have left up the crane boom when the crane was not used.
According to a press release in Arabic, Binladin Group is partly responsible for the accident.
The English-language service of the news agency did not report in detail. However, according to the English-language bulletin, the management of the group has been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall in the Grand Mosque yard. Thousands of Muslims are heading for the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group has not published a notice on the crane accident and the group representatives have not been reached for an opinion.
The king also accused the group of failing to comply with up-to-date safety regulations and to cooperate with meteorology experts.
The dozens of cranes surround Mecca's Suur mosque as part of Binladin Group's gigantic construction project.
For decades the Bin Laden family has had close contact with the Saudi family of rulers, and the Bin Ladens are responsible for a number of major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was an apostate son who had been abandoned by his family in the 1990s.
A crane accident in heavy rain and heavy wind occurred only a few days before the pilgrimage to Mecca, which is the duty of every capable Muslim to do at least once in life.
According to the authorities, 158 people are still in hospital.
The authorities ordered the payment of one million  Rials (about EUR 250 000) to victims' families and permanently disabled persons.
The other injured persons receive half of the compensation.
According to the B&Q boss, the phenomenon is driven by cheap Eastern European labour force
The British hire generalists more often than before," says Veronique Laury.
The popularity has been enhanced by skilled, self-employed workers arriving from Eastern Europe.
More than 200 new Screwfix stores for workers will be opened.
Meanwhile, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores around the country.
Text: Rupert Steiner, head correspondent, Daily Mail
The British are said to transfer home hammering and painting jobs to those who come from Eastern Europe.
Vasaring and painting skills seem to be scarce these days.
The British now employ more and more generals in the home to handle domestic snorting work, says the manager of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury is the new CEO in Kingfisher, who owns the chain of stores for home repairs. According to Laury, the phenomenon is driven by skilled workers from Eastern Europe who offer services at affordable prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open up 200 new stores for businesses, while 60 B&Q stores are closed.
Laury needs more female labour in B&Q stores, as eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are made by a woman.
At the moment, most of the staff are men.
According to Laury, there are some points to make about population trends, as more and more women living alone today are renovating their homes.
"The staff of our salesmen are still mostly men," says Laury.
"We need to balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80 per cent of the purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of the five women who are in the helm of British FTSE 100 companies and has also restructured the company's management team so that there is a balance between male and female managers.
Kingfisher is almost unique, as 50% of its staff are women, including the CEO and CFO.
"This was a conscious decision. Diversity is an important topic for us," said Laury.
"It hasn't been hard to find good women for the management team."
Kingfisher's six-month operating profit and sales figures are down, even though the company worked hard after the closures of the stores.
Kingfisher responds to current trends: the company owns the Screwfix and B&Q chains and intends to open 200 new stores.
The government of the three aces decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
In fact, visible effects were obtained quite quickly.
The sharp head of SAK and other employee centre organisations began to force the country immediately and as a result the country is standing on Friday because of the widespread protest of employees.
There are quite a few who think that reason is also there.
Let's see if it's worth a strike when things are bad.
Even the resistance movement has been set up.
More than 50 000 people have already visited the Internet to announce that they are not going to participate in the demonstration but are going to work.
It would have been impossible for us to do this in an old time of good consensus.
Of course, there was no Internet where to protest, but openly declaring to be a criminal would have been the political suicide of a small person.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of millions of trade unions does not give much thought, but it does give cause for thought.
The status of the trade union movement is no longer as obvious as it was 20 years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement as their own, the values have changed.
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay movement, the harsh decisions of the government can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
When things have seemed to roll on their own weight for years, now we finally get to the point in the unions, namely to defend the rights of the worker, visiblely and properly.
In this way, the government may wish to incarcerate the role of the Ay movement, when membership of the trade union may be seen as more necessary than before.
No matter what the organisations think, it is nonsense that Friday's demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped long ago.
For example, industrial output has fallen for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product will continue to decline and unemployment will rise.
You'd think these things would force everyone's mind.
For the University of Lappeenranta, a hard saving course: The goal is to save 8.5 million, reduce staff by 130
Lappeenranta University of Technology will start a saving course with a total cost reduction of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start negotiations for all staff with a savings target of 6.5 million annually.
In practice, this means reducing around 130 workers.
In addition, two million will be saved from other activities.
The background to the negotiations is the 2016 budget, which foresees a deficit of 8.5 million in actual activity.
It is also affected by the budget cuts made by the government.
During this financial year, the university will make about 2.6 million in deficit results.
The costs will increase slightly next year, but at the same time the funding from the Ministry will decrease by EUR 2 million and the rest by EUR 3.2 million.
The university's total budget is approximately EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive cuts in education and research and the reduction in corporate funding for our university is very significant," says Principal Anneli Pauli in the University's Bulletin.
Before the summer, the impact of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in additional funding is reflected in new dimensions.
Negotiations with shop stewards will be launched on Tuesday of next week and will last the six weeks laid down by law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finland for railways
The owner of the cheap bus company Onnibus, the British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company also aims at rail traffic in Finland.
I am very interested in taking part in Finnish rail traffic.
My Stagecoach company is one of Britain's largest railway companies," Souter says.
Rail transport should gradually open up to competition.
The first is local transport in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in 2017-2018.
After commuter traffic, long-distance traffic is on the move.
Souter says he's already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes the Onnibus plans.
Other international companies have expressed interest in rail transport at least by Transdev (formerly Veolia), which also has bus traffic in Finland and rail traffic in other parts of Europe.
At the US Central Bank, the time of the interest rate decision
The whole world will follow the meeting of the Federal Reserve of the United States on Wednesday and Thursday, which will decide on a possible increase in interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
Fair half of the economists who believed last week that the central bank would raise interest rates are now betting that the central bank would maintain interest rates at the current 0-0.25%, as shown by a survey conducted by the 80 economists at Reuters.
"This is an historic situation, as the central bank has kept interest rates close to zero for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a significant central bank can raise interest rates from zero and thus trigger normalisation of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Senior Researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The state of the US economy has been relatively good and the recovery has brought billions of additional dollars to the balance sheet and only slightly accelerated inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore a global situation that is less rosy.
It has called on the market to prepare for change, but there are also indications of the opposite.
The decision is due to be published on Thursday at 20:00 in Central Europe.
Whoever shot Delta State University left an apology note.
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning – before a colleague was shot later that day – Shannon Lamb wrote a note to apologize for the first murder and hope to cancel it, the authorities told me on Tuesday.
In Gautier, Mississippi, Delta State University, Lamb, a geography and social science teacher, called 911 about 10 a.m.
Monday, and he told me he shot someone.
Lamb called 911 and asked the police to come home.
"I shot my wife last night," Lamb told me. She also mentioned that there was a friendly dog in the house that was no harm to anyone but probably scared.
The police asked for the name of the caller, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb didn't give any motive for the shooting either.
The police arrived at the scene and found Amy Prentiss, 41, the body and Lamb's handwritten note, which read: "I'm very sorry and I wish I could undo what I did.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the message, Lamb drove 500 miles [500 km] to Delta State University, where he killed professor of history Ethan Schmidt before taking his life late on Monday when the police reached him.
William LaForge, the university's principal, explained that he was not aware of the contradictions between Lamb and Schmidt, but stated that something was clearly bothering Lamb.
On Monday it was reported that Lamb supposedly believed that Prentiss was also romantically involved with Schmidt, but the authorities announced on Tuesday that there was no information or evidence about the triangle.
Shawn O'Steen, married to Prentiss for seven years, described his former wife as a good person.
The couple had divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentis have a 19-year-old daughter who's upset.
The man said the daughter and mother were best friends.
According to Sun Herald, Lindsay Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss's, said that Prentiss worked online from home.
Knowles said that Prentiss had been dating Lamb for about three years, and he also told me about a woman's dog named Lightning.
"He always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
According to the police, Lamb had called relatives during Monday and told them that he was not going to prison.
When the police reached Lamb Highway 1 near Greenville that night, Lamb stopped the car, fled on foot, ran into the woods and took his own life.
According to the CV on the university's website, Lamb received doctorates in educational science at Delta State University in spring 2015.
Diluted Stars
The last few years have been heavy for the actor (in the picture on the left with his son Redmond).
In 2001, he fought leukemia, and in 2009, his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The actor has also struggled with drugs, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
Everything that's happened has really taken its toll.
Manchester United Luke Shaw on the sidelines for months because of two fractures.
Luke Shaw's right leg was broken in the Manchester United Champions League match against PSV Eindhoven.
The defender is saddened to remain sidelined for at least six months, but Louis van Gaal is still hopeful and believes that Shaw will return to the fields this season.
Twenty-year-old Shaw was injured in the PSV's defense area in a bad tackle by Héctor Moreno when the game was going on for fifteen minutes.
Shaw was given emergency care for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he could be transferred to the hospital.
"Shaw has two broken legs and is hospitalized," said Van Gaal.
Shaw will be transferred tomorrow or the day after tomorrow for surgery to Manchester.
The young man who joined Manchester United at the age of 18 has been through a lot and is now offended by the great game grips.
They gave Shaw oxygen in the locker.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but when a leg breaks in two places, he's on the sidelines for half a month and he's no longer in the block phase.
I hope he can still play this season.
Moreno seemed to get off lightly when the situation did not result in a red card of punishment.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish a Mexican player.
According to Van Gaal, the Italian judge made a mistake.
"You can figure it out yourself, but I thought it was worth a penalty kick and a red card.
It was a two-foot, reckless tackle."
Shaw tweeted, "Thank you all for your messages. I can't tell you how crushed I am. My recovery starts here and I come back stronger."
More on the topic: Manchester United's Luke Shaw aside in the PSV match
The English defender has a particular reason to recover in order to compete in the European Championships in France in June.
"It's a very bad injury," said PSV coach.
"In such situations of injury, all parties are always very sorry.
Players are never meant to harm an opponent."
Moreno broke his legs while playing in the Mexican ranks, only in the 2014 World Championships did the Netherlands piloted by Van Gaal.
"He is very sorry because his intention was not to harm the opponent. It is sad to hear that the injury is serious," Cocu said.
"I didn't see the situation.
All I saw was a ball going the other way, so it looked like he (Moreno) touched the ball, but I didn't see Luke's tackle."
"I know how it feels. I know how difficult this can be," Moreno said to SBS6.
"I feel really bad. I'm so sorry."
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
David Cameron should know Lorax better.
Before long, every parent realizes that a child learns his favorite book almost by heart.
Except for the David Cameron you saw.
When the Children's Holiday Association asked Cameron to name his favorite children's books, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, a teaching environmental story by Dr. Seuss published in 1971.
In a text published on SuperCamp's website, Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. "The story is funny, touching and creative, and it has a powerful message. I like to read it to my children because there's always a picture or a message we've never seen before."
It sounds good, except that the next paragraph where Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book is the summary of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to complement the short initial text.
"In the city of Availla, where the real trees and plants have disappeared and even the air is a commodity, there is a boy named Ted, who wants to get into the heart of the girl Audrey of his dreams by doing this greatest dream: to see the real tree," says the text. In the 1991 version of Dr. Seuss, or Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died, Ted had no crush on him.
If this is not suspicious enough, Cameron's text is partly consistent with the plot summary of the Lorax movie on the Internet Movie Database. It begins with: "In a city where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, there is a boy named Ted, who wants to get into the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the plot of the book will be so strange to him. Greedy Kerskanen will destroy the trees and make supplies of them despite the resistance of the name character Lorax. Lorax is a small, thick, mustache-like creature that protects the forests.
Likely such a small PR assignment has been entrusted to an assistant, apparently someone who has not read Lorax 20 times in a row as a child.
The Prime Minister's representative said that the text probably originated from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps did not comment further on the matter but confirmed that the text was written by Cameron's staff.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being off the English team, but it's still hard.
The encounter with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but once we have seen the last 3-0 test series defeat of the team selected by England on the tour, it is not expected.
I wouldn't rule out the possibility of an alien victory.
Alastair Cook's side may be more inexperienced than the team three years ago, but the team has good players and the team's attitude is strong – they don't have bad experiences from 2012, just youthful positiveness.
As a ball player, Moen Ali develops as a spiral pitcher, and Adil Rashid, even though he does not have test-level experience, represents an attack option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from the English Test team and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth out is obviously hard for me to understand as his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven Tests have been two good attacks under challenging circumstances, and the simple and cruel truth is that cricket players are judged according to the results.
For example, Joe Root is not a questionable choice because – as I have said before – players are the best voters.
A few 50-point fights would have kept Lyth on the team, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets another chance when he hits Yorkshire with more runs.
The English head coach, Trevor Bayliss, also praised his attitude when he did not do as well as he could, which does not surprise me. He is, above all, a team player.
The question of how long the Tester will have the opportunity to impress is difficult.
Lyth got seven ground matches, like his predecessor Sam Robson, while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance at both home and guest games.
Perhaps the only complaint is that England first used Jonathan Trot in the Caribbean — when Lyth was in top shape — but this missed opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales is coming on the team, and he's a hitter, and I appreciate it.
He's a cricket player of an unknown author, which we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he scored 236 points against us on Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this, of course, depends on the composition of the United Arab Emirates team.
The idea has been thrown into the air that Moe will start the punch with Cook, which will give us an extra spin pitcher while keeping four fast pitchers, and I am not against the idea.
I see no obstacle to the fact that the top pitcher could be hitting here, and this left-handed player has already shown himself to be a great cricket player.
Moe may not have made much progress on his local team in Worcestershire, but he's been team three, and that's no big difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Test games as the first replacement player to start in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points, and there was no turning back.
Zafar Ansari is a backup pitcher on the team, and from what I've seen of him, he has proved to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his statistics — an average of 31 points as a hitter and 35 as a pitcher — and this may be a long shot, but very many curve pitchers have not shown themselves ready, and the electors decided to take a young player.
He'll learn a lot during this fight trip.
Outside the playing team, England seems to have made a few intelligent choices for its coaching staff.
The appointment of the Sri Lankan striker, Mahela Jayawardene, as adviser to the Test games may be a breakthrough.
This is one of the sweetest men of the species, which brings with it a lot of experience because he has played under all kinds of conditions and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to the white ball section of the game trip and brings energy and ruthlessness.
I think he has always seemed suitable for international cricket, whether he is a player or coach, and like Mahela, he has the intelligence to use.
Sometimes a new sound in the dressing room, even if it says the same thing as before, can be a boost.
Colly's teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, has rested in one day's matches, Root has a similar opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and voters do not set a match schedule.
And we must bear in mind that, like the players, their job depends on the results.
These decisions are never made without consideration.
Brexit camp can win if the economy is in bad shape in 2017
The renegotiating strategy left behind by David Cameron for Britain's stay in the EU is, day by day, in a deeper and deeper swamp, even without the pleasing Jeremy 'yes or no' Corbynia's election to the leadership of the Labour Party or the TUC to make a violent mockery of Europe on Tuesday.
Other countries also have their own Corbys and Nigel Farage.
The European diplomat recently explained how many crises the EU is wringing – even though not everyone is an act of its own – and some of the Member States are tired of Britain's self-righteous agenda, which includes disunity-making concessions and harmful Treaty changes that they do not really want.
In Brighton, the annual Congress of the TUC decided that they would not be comfortable in the EU either if it broke down social security.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agent.
At summits and bilateral negotiations, the Prime Minister and Chancellor hang out in the capitals of different countries, capture the image of themselves in front of the famous monument, with or without high-ranking people, return home and say they have acquired allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an open-minded Britain inside the EU tent. "Don't leave us alone with France", Berlin says and suggests that an increasing number of short-sighted ministers and officials in different capitals have come to the point where they don't care anymore whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany's reasoning rational Chancellor is an ally, but has been in power for ten years and wants to leave office before it goes bad, as happened to those who stayed too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French François Hollande faces a re-election or a successor in 2017.
His power is waning, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, while Spain has a left-wing government.
It is hard to imagine them rushing to help selfie British people who could use their energy better to try to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, and they do not want to do so either, because most people have separatist tendencies.
Some of these ministers can plan to deliberately throw useless comments in the style of the Scottish National Party in the UK's 2017 election campaign to speed up Brexit's process, my friend suggests.
"The renegotiating was an arranged case." "Britain had nothing left to do with the renegotiating."
Europeans know how the British press hunts and how the EU-sceptic oligarch press is, just like the 1975 referendum that Tony Benni was working on, the result of which was in favour of 2:1 accession to the EU in 1973.
Perhaps someone has a distant memory of Boris Johnson, the Euro-opportunist who became known as our 'EU direct banana correspondent' in Brussels in the early 90s.
At least Ed Miliband knew his enemy.
These include tax-traveling, cell hacking and pseudo-temporary residents who own most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought roughly the same about them, but then realized that when you're in a cage with a rough gorilla, you have to hand out bananas as a distraction so that the gorilla doesn't eat you for lunch and dinner.
Mr Miliband was even more blairier than Mr Blair when he opposed the referendum; he agreed to the EU Constitution, which was then rejected; when France and the Netherlands rejected the Treaty in the referendum 2005, Mr Blair easily got off the hook.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly patted me on the back at Westminster on Monday, and I told him that he no longer has time to waste on me. There may be a risk that he will introduce Neil Kinnock's media boycott strategy from the '80s.
It may take time, but Corbyn needs to develop a consistent strategy for dating the media, not with me, but Andrew Marrin, whose BBC couch he sat on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what we politely call constructive.
He says he wants to keep us in a reformed Europe.
Most people outside Ukipin and Tory can probably say yes to this.
That's what Hilary "Benn but not Bennit" Benn told on radio and television this week when his inner Boy Scout tried not to admit that Corbyn was a bad bet to appoint the rugged John McDonnell as shadow finance minister.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father had difficulty in being on television disloyal to his Labour colleagues without going too far and losing his place in the House of Commons.
Hilary's troubles were more interesting.
Mr Benn said that he was against staying in the EU 'under all circumstances', and Mr McDonnel did not say so, nor did Corby's colleagues and members of the House of Commons at a private meeting on Monday night.
He wanted Corby to pass on how sweet a picture, you have to remember that he even touched me. Communicative discipline is important in the 24/7 era, especially in the social media discipline where paranoia and deception are smoldering.
Cameron does not need to be given a free pass with regard to the EU in order to take Labour's support for granted in the referendum, as Mr McDonnell has said.
At least that's what Simon Jenkins thinks.
Mr McDonnell and Mr Corbyn's equivoca tion of EU membership is suitable for a Bennite blockade and anti-capitalism past; discussions are no longer confined to a limited area of left-wing dissidents, for whom the idea of similarity being united is a central doctrine of the doctrine of doctrine.
There has also been an equivocation of NATO, and Tom Watson is unshakable that Corby is not campaigning for departure, and foreign diplomats are forced to try to clarify the matter in their own countries.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital? They have suspicious voters. Why should they give concessions to Britain when everything can be in vain?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the poor military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with the cuts of the Tory Government, which I was reminded of on Monday at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticized the British authorities' opinions on e-cigarettes
According to researchers, the state-funded institution's claims that the smoking of e-cigarettes is 95 % less harmful than traditional smoking arose at a meeting of 12 participants linked to the tobacco industry.
Experts criticised the evidence presented by the Public Health England (PHE) public health authority in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and the Lancet Medical Journal in the report on e-cigarettes.
The report published last month was described by the PHE as a "reversive and comprehensive review of results".
However, several researchers have questioned the certainty of the information and have highlighted the links of some experts to the tobacco industry.
Last month, the Lancet Medical Journal editorial took on teeth a "considerablely mild base" based on which PHE's main conclusion is based.
In addition, two researchers in the BMJ have wondered whether the claims were based on "rock or sand".
The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Professor of European Public Health Martin McKee and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, have stated: "The basic assumption of public health is that the policy is based on clear evidence of their effectiveness."
According to McKe and Capewell, the public assumes that the PHE's claim that "the best estimate currently available is that e-cigarettes are approximately 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes" should be based on detailed analysis and modelling of research results.
The argument stems from one meeting of 12 people convened for the development of a multi-criteria analysis model based on a multi-criteria analysis (MCDA), which sought to harmonise the views of participants on the disadvantages of nicotine products.
According to McKe and Capewell, the participants included EuroSwiss Health, whose previous independent research was funded by British American Tobacco (BAT).
In addition, the Managing Director demonstrated its support for BAT's public health performance in the report on sustainable operation.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting granted funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but the alleged past funding from Philip Morris International, a tobacco company, was not granted by that participant.
The selection criteria for the composition of the panel have not been explained, but there are many well-known supporters of electronic cigarettes, some of which recognise their involvement as an industrial funder.
However, some participants are not aware of their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting was also attended by the PHE Tobacco Officer.
According to McKe and Capewell, the group's study report shows that there is no conclusive evidence that the products are harmful to a broad range of products and that they meet their criteria.
However, no links or gaps are mentioned in the PHE report.
According to the PHE report, no evidence has been provided so far that electronic cigarettes can contribute to the smoking of children or non-smokers. McKee and Capewell consider the claim to be premature.
According to Professor Kevin Fenton, PHE's Director of Health and Welfare, the claims have been answered earlier.
According to Fenton, e-cigarettes are considerably less harmful than traditional smoking.
Every other person who smokes throughout life dies because of addiction to tobacco.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are lower than those of traditional tobacco, but the long-term effects need to be further examined.
The PHE is obliged to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially in a situation where the relative risks compared to traditional tobacco are unclear.
In the United Kingdom there are nearly 80 000 deaths related to smoking every year and smoking costs public health £2 billion a year.
Responsible action requires us to make clear the current evidence that e-cigarettes are not a risk-free option, but the harm they cause is a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco.
BBC should give up East Enders," says Channel 4 boss
Luke Johnson, head of Channel 4, has said that BBC should stop broadcasting certain programs, including EastEnders and The Voice. According to Johnson, commercial competitors would give their right hand to hit series such as Albert Square.
According to Johnson, the licence fee should only be used to make programs that other television stations do not do.
He criticised the submission of programmes likely to reach a smaller audience than the BBC, at the same time as the programmes of the major ratings of competitors, as well as, for example, the BBC4 channel.
After the BBC Director-General Tony Hall announced that the company wanted to increase cooperation with other organisations, Johnson said that for six years he had tried to get Channel 4 to work with the BBC without success.
"I do not agree with the idea that the BBC buys formats and broadcasts programmes that are clearly part of a competing channel's software," Johnson told the House of Lords' Communications Committee, which explained the future of the BBC.
If the BBC wants to have a broadcasting fee, which I do not think is necessarily a good idea in the medium to long term, it should at least reduce its supply to programmes which are not produced and purchased by others.
The BBC is sending The Voice to the best time because it wants the broadest possible support in the future.
If there's no other channel to take over the program, it's obviously ridiculous nonsense.
"I do not understand why a regressive tax should finance programmes that could be funded without subsidies," Johnson said.
The Voice is one of these, the EastEnders the other, although it is its own production.
A lot of channels would give their right hand for it.
I do not understand how this serves the services of the broadcaster.
I don't think these would be losses to the BBC."
Johnson is a serial entrepreneur who was in charge of Channel 4 in 2004-2010. He believes that the BBC is looking for good ratings because there are ambitious people working for the company and because they believe that it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson's comments on the BBC's most popular series are similar to those of former Sky boss Tony Ball, who proposed in his MacTaggart lecture in 2003 that BBC sell out series like EastEnders.
According to Johnson, the BBC's programmes for the Niche audience are shown on BBC4 where ratings are not usually measured, but the programmes fulfil their purpose. "BBC can say, in its hypocritical missions, that it has made £4 billion in broadcasting payments, but that it has made special programmes that no one was watching."
"BBBC presents them at times when no one will ever see them."
On the pay-per-views, Johnson said: "I challenge you to find another system that is just as old-fashioned, so that who gets the best out of it.
Of course, everyone thinks that £150 a year is cheap, but the people to whom it is a large sum, especially if the BBC is not very much looked at."
David Elstein, former director of Sky and Channel 5 channels, who also shared his views in committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should exchange its ancient missions for new 'information, teaching and entertainment'.
According to Elstein, the BBC's current supply is unlikely to have educational programmes – 1 per cent on TV and 0.1 per cent on radio. He adds that the BBC should learn from the Australian and Canadian broadcasters and re-enact its mission: "Information, lighting and entertainment".
On the question of cooperation, Elstein suggests that the BBC could increase transmissions, for example, from events such as Proms festival, where only a fraction of the concerts were broadcast last year. "BBC should also join the alliances with commercial channels to make the whole offering available online," he continues.
Brain cells can be controlled by sound waves using sonogenetics
The video shows how the shuttle worm changes direction when the ultrasound is applied.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems, so they can be controlled by ultrasound.
Small nematodes change direction when subjected to ultrasound with a frequency above the hearing range of the human ear.
Sound waves activate motion nerve cells genetically modified with a transport membrane that responds to ultrasound.
More on: Researchers monitor brain activity with light
According to researchers, worms were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new sonogenetics method, which uses the ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells with an external stimulus.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher in Salk Instute, La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the method can be used to replace deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS is an invasive method used to treat Parkinson's disease symptoms, where the brain is stimulated by electrical impulses.
The shuttles normally do not respond to ultrasound. Chalasani noticed that the worms, however, begin to react when they are placed in a liquid with microscopic bubbles.
According to Chalasan, the bubbles increase ultrasound waves that enter the worms.
Strengthened ultrasound waves affect TRP4 ion channels, which are found in some of the membranes of worms.
According to an article published in Nature Communications, sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells to which they are attached.
In order to control the nematodes by ultrasound, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of the nerves that control their movement appeared TRP4 ion channels.
When ultrasound was directed to modified worms, the microbubbles strengthened the sound waves and moved to the worms, causing a signal to start in the nerve cell.
The method is somewhat like optogenetics, which is a revolutionary tool that allows researchers to activate nerve cells with light.
According to Chalasan, however, sonogenetics have certain advantages compared to optogenetics.
Light is directed to the brain that is being studied by means of optical fibers. Low-frequency ultrasounds, on the other hand, easily penetrate the cell so that the ultrasound can be directed to the brain through the skull.
"We believe that gene and viral therapy will allow human nerve cells to be temporarily exposed to ultrasound signals in the clinical environment in certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
According to the researcher, the method could also be used in muscle cells and insulin producing cells.
Illegal torture devices — on your doorstep!
Advertising is a disgrace to the British arms trade.
Check out Amnesty International's anti-armament exhibition video.
Creepy killer missiles!
Leghold traps breaking ankles!
Grape bombs!
Remotelamps that cause unbearable pain but leave no trace!
The video is produced by Amnesty International and is designed to highlight the British Government's desire to sell arms to repressive regimes at the DSEI (Defence Security and Equipment International) fair in Docklands, London.
More on: DSEI gun fair: authoritarian regimes arrive in London
There are also posters for bus stops and subway cars that require another look.
"Important announcement: do you take the subway between 15 and 18 September?" The announcement resembles London Metro's announcements. On the other side of the metro line there is a picture of the tanker.
"In September, a group of gun dealers arrive in Docklands, and customers are asked for help to put an end to the gun trade fair."
Three hundred posters have been made by artists whose works were displayed at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collective called Special Pathol Group helped to distribute posters around London with a six-pound "adroom hack kit" with hexagon keys that allegedly have access to about a third of the world's bus stop poster racks.
Transport for London doesn't make vandalism laugh.
One of the prank ads of the Special Pathrol Group.
According to Cruel Designs curator and Essex University lecturer Gavin Grindon, artists have begun to question things and want to bring their political work to the public outside the galleries.
Artists have noticed that social influence through art requires that art be brought into the real world. Many people move to work with protest activists.
One of the posters against the arms trade greets public transport users on the subway.
Amnesty's video has been viewed over 100 000 times during the day via Facebook. It has been designed without compensation by the advertising agency VCCP, and both the graphic designer and the multiplier have also done their work without compensation.
Matt Lever, the artistic director of the VCCP, was concerned about the absence of trade fair advertising and the empty spot on ExCeL's event calendar, and he said, "Let's give them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They tried to make a more realistic, obscure company video, but bright colors and animation attract more attention."
"They have done a great job and helped us bring up fairs where there is illegal trafficking in torture equipment," says Amnesty's Tom Davies.
"Now the government must take action to ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded on our doorstep."
However, perhaps the most creative contribution of the gun fair is displayed in the exhibition rooms of ExCeL itself, where exhibitors make great use of euphemisms from their merchandise.
In its press release, Saab announced an order from the United States Army for "the AT4CS RS to be carried".
The product includes "a specially designed warhead that effectively penetrates directly into the target."
That doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight golden rules for those living in student dormitories
I moved to a dormitory 11 years ago, was innocent 19 years old, and I still believed in berets and moral relativism.
The most important lessons I can sum up with eight simple rules.
Moving to a dormitory is at its lowest arduous experience and, at its worst, shocking.
It's easy to start talking about things: telling everyone where you are, whether you liked the middle year and why you like Corbyn and why you don't "real hate or love Marmite, because that's just yeast extract, hahahaha, I'm in my room".
Take a breath sometimes.
And help others to breathe — show your interest and ask others questions.
Asking questions will guide the conversation and help you find the people you like and the people you wouldn't talk to even when your drops were on fire and these people would share fire extinguishers.
Give the others some room.
Our own rooms often serve as drinking counters, cinemas and public lounges, but your own room is also a place to dress, starting with underwear.
More on the subject: Don't even think about connecting dating with university studies
For the Introverts, university is tough.
Our own room should be a place of tranquillity. However, many dormitories form a social culture, where we walk from room to room and form lifelong friendships.
Such a culture can be a nightmare for a person who needs a place to recover.
It is not possible to say in this environment: "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to get out so I can recharge the energy that I used to date you."
Try to see if one of your fellow students is exhausted from social communication. Perhaps you should not knock on the door and send a text instead.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
There was a guy in my own dormitory who thought an unlocked door meant he was welcome in.
He saw a lot of things.
Make friends by baking.
You start your studies appropriately when baking is in, so if you bake brownies and knock on someone's door, you don't seem like a 50's, a little weird thing: "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something small. Smile when I ask you about your personalities."
Homemade delicacies are a great way to make new friends.
Your college friends are forced to talk to you, and thanks to a tasteful surprise, they can have a positive picture of you.
Of course, this requires reasonable bakering skills from you.
If you serve unhappy lumps of flour, sugar, and fat, others will probably pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Stealing food is also a common offense in student dormitories.
Of course, taking another chicken is stealing, but may I pour a drop of someone else's milk can into his tea?
Always check with the owner of the milk can.
You'll probably get a permit, even if the milk quotes the can owner.
I understand it's annoying if someone steals something from you, but try to deal with it as adultly as possible – unlike my own student friend who laid down detergent in his milk as a punishment for the milk thieves.
She's in prison now.
Don't make any noise when the others are trying to sleep or study.
It's not just because it's polite, it's also worth remembering that every other man digs a hole...
In my own dormitory, a girl asked the neighboring room to adjust the music to a lower level, for it was three o'clock in the morning and she had an exam this morning.
The neighbor just increased the volume.
When the next room finally shut down, the girl let the neighbor sleep for two hours. She left for three hours in the exam, left the music in her room, and locked the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dormitory?
And wouldn't it be strange if you first thought that your college partner was your future spouse, that you would start dating, divorce, and have to see him every day and lose the right to meet your mutual friends with him?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, and if the student isn't exactly the only one, try to control your desire.
If you notice that someone has forgotten their keys to a room where the door is not locked, the limit of prank and bullying is more variable than you might think.
A good joke is funny, but one you can recover from in an instant.
Hiding an object can be a valuable and fun lesson, but no one's room should be mixed with toothpaste and shampoo.
The door to the other room can be locked and dropped into a glass of water, which you put in the freezer, but do not put anyone's things on the ceiling with a blue sticker a couple more times more.
A racist attack on the accommodation of foreign students in Kitee - The house planned as a reception centre was vandalized in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack was carried out on the accommodations of foreign students in Kite in North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, it is not the accommodations for minors who have been in Finland for longer than that, says Heidi Luukkainen, teacher at the Kite Evankelinen folk high school.
The windows and walls of the dormitory's accommodations were stained with racist signs, such as swastikas, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one of the accommodations," says the police of Eastern Finland.
According to Luukkainen, who is responsible for youth guarantee training at the Folk High School, there were an estimated ten people in the vandalized building at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and grown-up people are free to move, so some might have been elsewhere," Luukkainen says.
People from 12 different nationalities are staying at the folk high school.
They have already been students in Finland for some time, as well as newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
Everyone in a messed-up building has a status.
Some study in adult comprehensive school, some in vocational studies and some in Finnish," says Luukkainen.
A status is a so-called continuous residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreign national who has been in Finland for some time.
The police in Eastern Finland investigate the attack as an act of damage and a violation of domestic peace.
According to Luukkainen, an information conference was held for students on Monday, with the necessary interpreters present.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for over a decade, and this is the first time something like this has happened," Luukkainen says.
According to Lukkainen, the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
At least three men were suspected of doing so and they had been travelling on a light car.
I think this is the whim of the youth weekend evening, when this subject has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious," Luukkainen says.
In Salo, too, a hospital has been vandalized and a reception centre has been planned.
The incident happened last week.
This matter was reported on MTV's website on Tuesday night.
There was a swastika drawn on the hospital wall and written in English "You are not welcome".
A police report has been filed.
Clarification 15.9. at 4.02 p.m. Corrected incorrect information provided by the police regarding the age and status of the people living in the building.
The government is shutting down the Y train to Karjai - the passengers are grumpy, "unintelligently idiotic"
The Y train from Helsinki to Raasepori Karja will stop running in March.
The news was indignant at passengers arriving at the beginning of the train at the Helsinki Central Railway Station.
In particular, the downfall strikes the Siuntians," said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It's totally idiotic because the population is growing and the working people need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be anything but political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says on HSTV's interview video he'll come to the capital with a tractor or something.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H- and R-trains running on the main track will be combined into a new R-line.
Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula will be disabled.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on the routes on which the Ministry buys train traffic during the next contract period.
The contract period will change at the end of the year and there will be routes to be closed throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement to be finalised in the autumn will be subsequently adopted by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Bengtström from Siuntio considers that the state's train cutter is short-sighted.
We are making the same mistakes that have been made in the past and are repeating them in a very systematic way.
And then there's regret.
The Y train is also used by others other than the Raseporians and the Siuntios, because it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Annina Pöyry, from Espoo, was upset by the fate of those travelling farther away from the city area by train.
"It's especially bad for those who have to redeploy their journey," he said when he was in pain on the Y train.
A little relief is about to come.
There will probably be a new train connection to the beach, which will replace the Y train in the Helsinki Region (HSL), i.e. take it all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This will increase the costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for the municipalities and their taxpayers in the region.
"We are now beginning to explore different options and their impact on service level and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to estimate the costs accurately.
According to Rihtniemi, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid around one million for the Y train a year, but the Ministry has certainly paid much more than that.
The R-line on the main track misses two stations.
Instead, the number of train shifts in Ainola and Saunakallio will double.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease throughout the country.
The Ministry no longer buys train traffic on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is shortened to Pieksämäki-varkaus.
Train services are reduced on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka harbour and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million trips per year are made on stopping shifts, while the total number of trips purchased by the Ministry is about nine million.
The new agreement is intended to provide the State with an annual savings of 12.3 million.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in Capital's Currentness book: "Marx is worth studying"
The global economic crises have brought to the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and the capital of his terminal published in 1867-1894, writes George Hakanen, a former Chairman of the SKP, in his book Marx's Capital's topicality today.
"He is now taken more seriously than in a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx's assessments of the development of the capitalist economy, internationalisation and penetration into all areas of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of financial and fictional capital have proved to be astonishingly farsighted.
The list of authors of the book based on the capital seminars organised by Hakase also includes the professor of Aalto University, the respected financial figure Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes that Marx is current "now and forever".
However, the former Chief Executive Officer of the Business Research Institute and the Business Delegation is not Marxist, is it?
No, no, no, no.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not regard Marx as a current economic thinker but rather as an interesting social theorist.
Today, social sciences are differentiated and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary expert.
"The usual idea is that the history of the idea tells of the wrong opinions of dead men," Korkman starts.
It is true that Marx's predictions went terribly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far conclusions from the beginning of capitalism," Korkman says.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"The more relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now we are again discussing Marx's interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may be able to give inspiration to anyone who wants to understand the big picture, the changing world as a result of the technological upheaval," Korkman analyses.
But what the government should decide tomorrow isn't gonna help.
After all, he thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should only be stopped.
Still, Korkman thinks it's a good idea to get to know Marx.
"In the '70s Marx could not be read," Korkman says.
"Maoists and Trotskyists and other sects all hated capitalism, but even more hate each other."
Today, the debate is more diverse and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political burdens of the past.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's mindset as well as other classics," Korkman says.
The UN calls for war criminals to be convicted in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the creation of a special court to investigate war crimes committed during the Sri Lankan Civil War, reports AFP.
The UN report on the civil war in 1983-2009 was published on Wednesday after a long postponement.
The report blames both the Sri Lankan armed forces and rebels known as Tamil Tigers for war crimes.
It is estimated that at least 100,000 people died in the Sri Lankan Civil War.
Even the number of victims is not exactly known.
Especially in the last months of the long war in 2009, a major military attack should be properly investigated, as called for in the UN report.
The Sri Lankan Armed Forces report blames torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which is as likely to be the victim of men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have been guilty of forcing bystanders and children into combatants.
According to the report, both parties have committed murders.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intended to organise the investigation itself, but did not intend to allow the UN Court of Justice to be set up because foreign judges.
In England's Yo test, you had a chance to weigh social media.
On Wednesday, the autumn student writings included a long foreign language, which the majority had English.
England's skills were tested by over 16,000 trainees.
You could write a paper on social media or something.
Based on our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the writing of the 150-250 word could be addressed to the editor of the online magazine's advice column.
The headline was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt corresponds to Leelia's Finnish resting chair.
He was asked for advice on how to get parents to look at matters for young people as well.
The total number of subjects was four, one of which had to be selected.
"It was the hardest of them", assessed the third topic by Mia Lybeck, English lecturer at the Swedish High School in Porvoo.
The third subject was just a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
On the other hand, Lybeck said the fourth topic was quite nice.
It had to write a fire speech as to why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school we have practiced writing speeches," Lybeck says and estimates the whole experiment "unlikely normal".
In English - or Swedish - the English experiment allowed you to answer questions about texts such as adaptation to climate change and handling of large data masses.
On Wednesday some long Russian (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
The autumn articles will continue on Friday, when another Finnish or Swedish or Finnish experiment will take place.
In upper secondary schools, the test is organised normally, which means that it is not affected by employees' protests.
The matriculation examination board advises the candidates to find suitable transport connections in time to get to the trial.
You can also have more time if you can prove that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
A shop was robbed in Oulu at gunpoint.
On Wednesday morning, a shop was robbed in the Kello district in Oulu.
According to the police, the robber was wearing dark clothes and a face - covering commando hat.
The man's normal body and about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money as his prey.
It's being investigated as a felony robbery.
The police are preparing tens of thousands of protestors for their arrival in Helsinki - support teams from other parts of Finland
A protesting demonstration against the government's operating decisions will be blocking the city centre on Friday, predicting the police.
According to preliminary information, as many as tens of thousands of people can arrive.
Members of the Associations of SAK, Akava and STK will meet at the Railway Market at 11 a.m.
Police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
In turn, the task of the police at work is not only to carry out alert tasks and other police activities, but also to ensure that the expression of a giant mind goes smoothly.
Roads leading to the railway market will be closed to motor vehicles for the period from approximately 9.30 to 14 p.m.
Only emergency vehicles will be allowed in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut off at Kaisaniemi's roundabout, from the west to Mannerheimintie.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Chief Inspector Seppo Kujala?
At least for the time being, it looks like it's enough.
I'm not taking a stand on a cop's industrial disputes.
According to Kujala, support teams from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki because of the demonstration.
The police won't tell us the exact number of patrols.
"Some amount is coming, but as a rule we can manage on our own," Kujala says.
Police advise against private car driving in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic bump extends from Hakaniemi level to its core center.
Standing traffic is expected from the morning early in the evening.
With protestors from other parts of Finland, a lot of charter buses are also coming to Helsinki.
They won't let them go to Railway Market.
Buses, in principle, remain quite distant.
The rest of the way must then be walked to the demonstration site," Kujala says.
The demonstration also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From the point of view of the police, there's a positive side to this.
The issue of the smooth running of public transport, which is normally at hand at these large gatherings of people, will now be dealt with on its own.
The demonstrators have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of government economic policy may come to Helsinki.
The police expect the demonstration to proceed peacefully.
After all, people are ordinary people who work or are unemployed - ordinary citizens.
After all, Finns are sensible and peaceful people," says Kujala.
Local demonstrations will also be held in different parts of Finland on Friday.
Friday's demonstration is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is not a very good benchmark for it in Finnish political history," says Emeritus Martti Sisiäinen, professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It's no wonder the Ay movement is protesting.
If it didn't, it would put your hands up in front of the government," Siisäinen says.
A very right-wing government has struck at the cores of Finnish corporatism tradition - and also at points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's tough grip on contract law is missing.
There are a lot of features here that we are really trying to get the Ay movement down on its knees.
At the same time, too, the Ay movement has a place to look in the mirror.
A mirror is needed, for example, because the Ay movement does not have the support of all employees for Friday's demonstrations.
What is new now is the sharp division that the demonstration will bring about in the group that the Ay movement would like to take part in the demonstration.
The unemployed people gathered from all over Finland expressed themselves at the Parliamentary House in November 1993.
If you're looking for a point of reference for Friday's demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed," says Siisiäinen, organized in 1993.
In the middle of the deepest recession, Murrostorsta gathered together 20,000 unemployed.
The government of Esko Ahon (Kesk) stumbled from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relationship between the Finnish Government and employees' organisations had never been as bad as in the days of Aho's bourgeois government.
Now the relationship between the government and the Ay movement may be even worse than in the time of Murrostorsta.
Furthermore, Finland's highest bourgeois government is now in power," Siisiäinen says.
The current coalition of government is still interesting in such a way that it is so strict in the right, despite what the Finns said.
There were still certain elements of the old labour movement at the time of the storm.
Several thousand protesters are expected on Friday.
The demonstration also stops public transport and possibly closes day care centres and schools.
Although the demonstration does not receive undivided support from employees, it can become the largest in many years.
In recent years, approximately 300 demonstrations have been held in Helsinki every year.
They're from side to side.
Traditionally, Finnish protests by the Ay movement have been quite peaceful - even though the policies have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, we are law-abiding.
The protestors are trying to avoid damaging or destroying property," Siisäinen says.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of demonstration changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and the police prepared to get some pig shit on their heads.
The firefighters strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also striking strikes, including pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical strikes in the 1970s
The most significant strikes in the 1970s were a metal strike in 1971 and a power plant and electric strike in 1977.
Seventy thousand metal men took part in the metal men's strike.
The strike was suspended by a proposal from the Conciliation Board after seven weeks of the strike.
Metalmen received a 16 percent increase in wages.
In the spring of 1977, the electric strike lasted 49 days and caused blackouts all over the country.
Breakthrough Thursday, 1993
On 4 November 1993 some 20 000 people, many of whom have been made unemployed by the recession, met in front of the Parliamentary House to demonstrate their work.
Firefighters striked for three months in 1998
Firefighters' strike was one of the longest, if not the longest, national strike in the 1990s.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were caught in an egg rain when farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
'Siberia teaches, the EU stops' was one of the slogans.
To Espa, farmers fell tons of snow.
The Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 also led farmers to protest and burn bales in front of the meeting place.
Nurses strike in 1983 and 1995
Nurses were on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been on strike was 1983.
The strike in 1995 was colored by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened with strike and mass withdrawals of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass redundancies hastened the negotiations to a conclusion.
Doctors on strike 2001
"Doctors on strike - under duress" was the slogan of striking doctors in 2001.
The strike by municipal health centre and hospital doctors lasted about five months and sparked a lively debate on how strikes could endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector increased doctors' salaries.
Students on the move in 2013
Around 5,000 students marched in favour of student support from Senate Square to Parliament House in Helsinki in 2013.
The Central Crime Police investigates the background of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the Central Crime Police for assistance in investigating the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, in Aisterheim, near the German border, the Austrian police stopped a truck with 42 refugees.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
Those on the ice truck were all in good shape.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and the main responsibility lies at the scene in Austria, says Tero Haapala, Chief Inspector of the Central Crime Police.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling by lorry in Austria were more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board apparently died by suffocation.
According to the Finnish public limited company, the truck belongs to a Finnish company, which first reported its cooperation with the Austrian police.
Among other things, the company carries out restaurant activities and its CEO is a man of foreign background, about 40 years old.
In Austria, two Iraqi men have been arrested for smuggling human beings.
A refugee-beating captain, a former drug courier and a rich businessman - the story of five smugglers
A loaded king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a stylistic missionary, and a taxi driver who thinks he's a good guy.
Such people, for example, are involved in the smuggling of human beings into the European Union.
The criminologist Andrea Di Nicola and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci at the University of Trento have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers" and their book The Death Travel Agency is published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the tentacles of human smuggling, propose solutions, and present smugglers on different steps of the business.
HS presents five of them.
I'm gonna beat the hell out of them right now.
The Kerkenna Islands on the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians are heading there for the summer.
In terms of its location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, as the journey to the island of Lampedusa, which belongs to Italy, is only 120 kilometres away.
For comparison: distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is approximately 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, the captain burning in the chain and the father of six children.
Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimps, but it is more profitable for a fisherman to transport people.
That's what Emir has done with his blue, ten - foot [10 m] wooden boat hundreds of times.
If the boat is full, it can accommodate 40 people.
For one trip, Emir earns approximately 8,000 euros after expenses.
Emir has five assistants who are looking for clients all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until another outbreak of the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will house them in empty houses for as long as it pleases them.
Food is provided in such a way that customers barely survive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer runs out of money, that's their problem.
We leave for the water at midnight with a smothered lantern.
The first night is driven away from the islands, then stopped, waited for the day and driven the following night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and in 20 - meter - high waves passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir is on his way back.
Emir wants people to be afraid of him.
That's why he's beating his clients and at least claiming to beat the troublemakers to death.
He says in the book that once the police caught him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed customers one by one from the neck and threw them overboard," Emir says in the book.
The quietest passengers come from the south of the Sahara.
They say he's gonna have to abuse his countrymen for this.
I'm gonna beat the shit out of them right now.
We need to show them who's in charge right now.
Just a regular cab driver.
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.
His taxi isn't very good - the starter engine is running out and it's already seen its best days.
The most important thing for Goran's customers, however, is that the taxi is moving at all and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
A centre for asylum seekers is located next to the village, where families are mainly allowed.
In the surrounding forests, men travelling without their family stay in tents, lavage and abandoned cars, which has now been found or built by anyone.
Families living in the forest who, for one reason or another, have not applied for asylum in Serbia.
Some also stay in private apartments, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his clients.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans the route requires a large number of crossings and weeks of walking in difficult terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When people finally arrive at the Bogovaða area, the great node of human smuggling, they are dead tired.
Goran's riders are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best clients are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say things once and that's enough," Goran says.
He says the Africans are trying to compromise.
Goran won't like that.
He's a fool. He's a fool all the way.
First we agree on a price of EUR 300, for example, and then they lower it to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I don't care about the money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than the others and charges only EUR 50 per person for a ride to the Hungarian border.
It's about 200 miles away, most of the highway is nice.
I hear colleagues are asking for a triple or quadruple price.
Goran earns about 50 000 euros a year.
It is not a great sum for the smuggler, but it is a very nice annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered taxis not to be allowed to transport migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his rider a mile from the border.
Then he points his customers in the right direction and turns away.
At Work of Mercy
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called the Missionary, and that's not just a nickname.
Indeed, he has a Protestant church in Kampala, Uganda's capital, where many believers who have fled Congo are visited, and a small center that helps Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He sees himself doing the work of mercy.
It's important for the missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and makes sure that the rubber band of white underwear looks elegantly under the low waist of jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his SUV, and his three motorcycles.
When the missionary does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
The customer first calls one of the missionaries' five telephone numbers.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money gently, and slid into the cross - border peddlers.
In order to obtain the status of asylum seeker or refugee in Uganda, the authorities must be informed that they come from war zones such as North Kivu and that they have had to flee their home from violence.
Often it is true, but if not, the missionary arranges a new identity for the customer.
The old identity card will be destroyed and another one will be replaced.
The Missionary contacts with the Ugandan police will help.
The customer will then be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: asylum procedures, NGOs, eventually the UN Refugee Organisation (UNHCR).
The missionary knows bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He charges each step separately: submitting an application to the Ugandan police costs about EUR 100, managing documents for a humanitarian organisation about 150, and moving to a European country, for example, EUR 4 500-7,000.
Foliota and ice cubes
Tom is an inquiring smuggler, a former drug courier.
An Irishman in his 40s is on duty on the French coast of Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks on their way to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan, a French taxi driver in London, and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they are in the human smuggling business.
At night Tom and the taxi driver picked up their customers, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near Calais center.
They're driving the A26. They're trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would go straight to prison for illegal immigration.
Tom doesn't want that. He's been doing seven years for drugs.
A taxi stops, Tom and his clients run across the highway to a rest stop where the drivers sleep before they cross the canal to the British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck - to make sure it is on its way to England and not to Holland, for example - and cuts through the safety cable of the protective cover.
We have to do it quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver's in on it, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his client in aluminum foil, the same one that is wrapped around a roast or baked potato in the kitchen.
It should prevent a police heat scanner from detecting a hideout.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in a truck and leaves the scene hoping that he doesn't drive a lot of stowaways, at least not before Britain.
King of Smugglers
Muammer Kqk is one of the world's most famous human smugglers.
The up-and-coming Turk has been called the champion of marketing and the unquestionable king of illegal invasions of the Mediterranean, who controls sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Since the 1990s, K
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only claims the money when he gets there.
One of the new methods is a luxury craft scheme: Turkish ports are supposed to rent yachts to take American or European families for a few days on tourist cruises.
In reality, ships are being loaded to the full by Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are being transported from Istanbul to a port and then to Europe by sea for a fee of between EUR 5 000 and EUR 7 000.
Customers are stored in human storage facilities, such as old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People are being crammed into minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They're told to hide among the vegetation and wait for the signal.
Once it's delivered, we'll have to board the ship quickly.
Passengers must stay the whole way below deck.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, for there are no other signs of the crowd.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
After the cost of one luxury ferry trip, K
He does not handle practical matters himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, accommodations and other smaller people to do the work for him.
During the summer season transports are arranged for at least hundreds and K
It is believed that he bought land through covert companies, pharmaceutical companies and more than a hundred homes he rents.
In 2011, Muammer K.q.k was arrested simultaneously with a representative of the Turkish Democratic Party and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, apparently, he's gone missing.

An American Olympic runner tells about his illness and becoming a prostitute in his book
Three times in the Olympic Games, the new book by the 1,500 - meter runner Suzy Favor Hamilton has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book Fast Girl, tells of his career ending and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published fragments of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the games in top shape and ran at the qualifiers for the second best time.
At the final, however, he panicked.
From the very beginning, he rushed to the top and defended his leading position with a manic run.
However, 150 meters before the goal, his strength was exhausted.
He collapsed on the surface of the track, and he was passed one after another by the other rivals.
I felt like an idiot and I thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself over the goal line," says Favor Hamilton in his book.
Later, it was revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt tremendous pressure for success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of getting money for having sex with strange men.
He also persuaded his husband to accept his actions.
Favor Hamilton's rate was 450 euros an hour.
He says he spent the money on a luxury life.
Another explanation that Favor Hamilton had for becoming a prostitute was that he needed adrenaline spikes similar to those he had received when competing in athletics.
Later, Favor Hamilton discovered that he was suffering from bipolar disorder.
The double life of a former star runner was revealed at the end of 2012 when the Smoke Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton attended the Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was 3,57,40 feet [1,500 m] of world statistics at the time, but was the last in the Sydney Olympic Final.
The world champion rejoiced when the Federation disciplined the Norwegian ski rooster: "Straightback"
The Norwegian ski king, Petter Northug, has exceeded the limits of suitability in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Like last summer and autumn, Northug and the Norwegian Ski Association have been twisting the sports contract.
Although the Union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been good enough for many world champions and Olympic winners.
The Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northug from the World Cup of the coming season.
The decision was praised by the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said that he was glad that the union controlled the ski rooster.
"Thank you for pointing at the spine," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the union sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Association and Northug is about money.
Northug apparently wants to be part of the season's national team so he can advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent a union that would also care for future generations and would not allow one athlete to play solos.
At the same time, he recalled that the Union has granted Northug financial and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has a completely different set of rules than just because he is the best.
On Tuesday, Northug published his own press release in which he assured us that he would like to play in Norwegian colours next season in the World Cup and then in the World Cup and the Olympic Games.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six World Championships in her career, two of which were gold.
He was on the team that won the message gold last winter in Falun.
Roast translators' shield day is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On S.H.I.E.L.D. Day 25.9. there will be stunts in various restaurants and shops that have been awarded the Roast Translators' Plate.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high-quality food industry and lower the threshold for going to a restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, we would like to point out that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the capital region, but the top restaurants inspected and rated by an impartial operator are located all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the significance of the event as a part of increasing the awareness of the restaurants and the organisation.
The day is held in Vaasa in restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola there is a restaurant in Old Town.
The event has also received significant international attention.
The decision has therefore been made to make the event one of the most significant international events in the organisation, which will take place on the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland will remain the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: The Finnish Attorney General has been consulted on the establishment of the Kauhava office.
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to set up a refugee reception centre at the premises of the ex-apartment of Kauhava currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the region is still permanently situated in critical infrastructure of the crisis period, which is used by the armed forces and its partner, the Finnish independent network Oy.
Kauhajoki magazine reports that according to a private individual, placing a reception centre in the same building would constitute a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the armed forces may have interests in the area and airport of the former Air War School, the impact of which has also not been clarified during the preparation of the reception centre, the newspaper writes.
The case states that there have been negotiations over the last two years with regard to the Kauhava airport on the organisation of flight training and the arrival of a potential foreign operator at the airport.
This issue has been discussed with the Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (p.a.) and the Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Defence Arto Rädy.
A private person states to the Attorney General that the complaint is not a matter of objecting in principle to the reception centre, but that the planned location in the former garrison area is wrong.
The City Council of Kauhava dealt with the reception center issue last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Governance means that immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions," Niinistö commented to the journalists at night after meeting the presidents of all parliamentary parties at his official residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, concerns about the management of the refugee situation united all participants.
He considers it valuable that in Finland government and opposition parties are able to discuss the underlying issues confidentially.
Especially in these times when we face great challenges
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria, as well as Russia's and the United States' actions in the region, can also have an impact on Ukraine and, consequently, on the situation in the Baltic Sea region.
Niinistö is hopeful about the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, namely that of the United States and Russia, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the tension in the Baltic Sea.
According to Niinistö, the question of NATO was also addressed in the discussions.
The president did not comment on the labour market situation.

The Department of Early Education promises to inform you more about changes in operations tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, communications need a wide range of channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches are one of the others.
This kind of direct speech channel will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä told journalists in Parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess the frequency of the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be delivered on Yle's channels.
If other channels register as a channel, we'll see.
Now let's use this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires the provision of television and radio speech to citizens.
This dossier, which we are talking about here, is quite complex and requires a longer justification.
That's why we ended up on this channel, Sipilä figured it out.
The speech will be broadcast from 21.05 to 21.20 both on TV1 and Radio in Finland.
You can also watch it in Yle Arena.
Squirrel's taking a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä's television talk will not tell us about a more general turn inside the government.
Is it an attempt to take the right of definition of public debate more strictly into its own hands and to refuse to discuss the questions raised by the public debate?
It reminds me of Mr Soin's recent comment that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define himself.
In the interests of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these matters are not related.
Koivunen understands that commercial media is indignant about Sipilä's announcement.
It would be strange if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not announcements in democracy.
It is the role of the media, by definition, to ensure that political agendas are not adopted.
According to Koivuse, television speech is a big risk to Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table to meet the exceptionally high expectations of the speech.
Is there more of what we have already heard today?
Or can he speak in a different tone, in a different way or in different words or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old thing, one must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
In this respect, the public is taking a risk if it is not a specific situation but a routine speech among others.
There is a risk that Yle will be branded as a communicator of politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in the interest of Yle or in the general direction.
♪ A clever bet from a stilt ♪
What is also important in the future speech of Sipilä is what the Prime Minister fails to say, the media researcher stresses.
In the evening, we should look carefully at what Sipilä is missing and what she is not missing from," says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to the Moon, TV talk is a clever move from Sipilä, as this allows him to express his own view without gravel sounds.
This will give the message a public audience without a journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
Sipilä bypasses the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a danger that the media will interpret something wrong because there will be no more specific questions.
According to the moon, it's very important how Sipilä performs on TV - whether the sweat is dripping, the hands are shaking.
He compares Sipilä to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can make a good point, it can work.
The situation is different from that if the government were to inform something, because here a person is speaking directly to another person.
This is what Obama and his partners do regularly ( United States President Barack).
That's really unusual.
Political researcher Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to the public to be truly exceptional.
He said that it has not happened in decades that the Prime Minister should speak directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means," says Railo.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister wants to make the Finns sympathetic to the blackmail ahead.
On Friday, employee organisations will organise demonstrations and strikes against government action.
Paavo Arhinmäki, Chairman of the Left Alliance, says on Twitter that Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a Prime Minister's announcement, so that the speech could also be discussed.
Antti Rinne (SDP president) again announces that he is challenging Sipilä's dialogue.
This is no time for monologues.
Soon six months after the election.
You can't hide in the endless world, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A nine-year-old boy on the run has been found in Tampere.
The boy was fine when we found him.
The boy's been found, and the boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The Police Department of Inland Finland also confirms the matter to Iltälehti.
The boy went out to play at 4:00 in the afternoon.
Later last night, she was no longer in touch.
My father thanks all the people who helped me find him.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed more than 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time.
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed by the violent fad of young people: You create hatred
Makwan Amirkhani, a free fighter with a Kurdish background, released a video on Facebook, which particularly appeals to young people with an immigrant background.
Makwan Amirkhani gave a heavy speech against street fighting among young people.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and arriving in Finland with his family at the age of five, has so far won both his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series in the championship.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking me to look at an Instagram account.
There are videos on the account where young people fight with extreme violence.
Amirkhani tells me he's disappointed in the young people's fad.
Amirkhan, 26 years old, has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick down the ground, sit on one of them, and hit them blindly without thinking about any of these consequences, what this will do when you do this kind of videos, Amirkhani updates.
It's hard to defend anymore.
Some of the young people seen in the videos are of immigrant origin.
According to Chief Inspector Jarmo Heinonen of the Helsinki Police Department, fighting videos have been downloaded by immigrants and young people from Finland.
It's the fact that you're fighting at the top of the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, Amirkhani in Turku reminds us.
Amirkhani reminds us that there are sites in Finland that are looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have come up with an outrageous number.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you any longer.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be guests here for quite a long time.
That's a different way to thank you for being here, Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever become victims of racism, you will blame yourself for it.
Think about it a couple of times before you go along with something like that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action is a contribution to racism.
You guys make me hate that I don't like either.
You're already in pretty bad shape and you're not going to make it any better, Amirkhani decides.
SAK pledges its position on the austerity package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
On Twitter, the President of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, explains that the employee association will discuss its position on the alternative savings list presented by the STTK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK's proposal on Twitter.
Earlier on Wednesday, STTK announced that it would present its own proposal to the government to achieve the 5% productivity leap demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk).
Mr Sture Fjäder, President of Akava, believes that the proposal will be approved by the government if the SAK, STTK and Arava are all behind it.
However, it would require that the largest employee organisation SAK soften its previous position.
The President of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, made a few comments on Twitter.
Mrs Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open up the labour market lock" and that agreements concluded by active parties are needed instead of coercive laws.
Mrs Lyly points out that Mr Sipilä's proposal for a social agreement was not acceptable to the SAK.
In the past, Mr Sipilä interrupted negotiations on a social contract when the SAK refused to commit itself to the 5% productivity leap target.
Comment: The grand demonstration is threatening to go "It feels a little funny to thrash your fist"
It seems a little funny to put a fist in your pocket if you already have a settlement paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
Atmospherics vary from side to side in an employee camp.
Is it supposed to call the government down, or is it supposed to make a deal with it?
On Monday, s.K.A.'s union leaders were blowing out holy hatred for the government of the republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened with catching up.
The threat spread to the Akavaans.
The teachers' union OAJ threatened to close schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, OAJ withdrew: no school or kindergarten will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), chairman of the STTK staff centre organisation, appeared conciliatoryly.
He said that he had kept in touch with the government and that he would produce an alternative proposal called for by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk) as a 5% productivity leap.
The President of Akava, Mr Sture Fjäder, hastened to announce immediately that his settlement papers have already been completed.
At first, there wasn't a sound from the S.K.A. office.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to reach an agreement when it was on Monday that the union leaders ordered the country to stand on Friday.
Finally, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK would look for solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order to create a collective performance of employees, the SAK should be inclined to accept a 5% productivity leap as an objective.
It is no wonder that Palola's STTK has relations with Sipilä's government.
The right hand of Palola, Jukka Ilmous, Director of Social Impact at STTK, previously served as a special assistant to the central prime ministers Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
In fact, Palola described the government's expertise as improving all the time.
A coincidence or no coincidence, but Palola's exit took a little boost away from Finland's stoppers, whose front shot was the ACP Marko Pieinen (sd).
I mean, it's kind of funny to put a fist in your pocket if you already have a settlement paper in your pocket.
Edited at 6 p.m.: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
Sergey Naryshkin, President of the Russian Duma, criticised the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
The President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, felt that Mongolia was a better OSCE host than Finland.
In the capital of Mongolia, Ulan Bator, a September session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun in which Naryshkin made extensive comments on the Helsinki Festival in July.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who had been forced into the European Union to attend a meeting - a matter on which the President was able to remind journalists.
According to our estimates, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed according to the news agency Interfax.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU but also at the United States, where his access had also been blocked.
Sanctions are a political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation was uncomplicated, so Naryshkin continued to pick up on Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for its "excellent organisation".
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting that took place in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue should not be hindered.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (kok), the leader of the meeting at Ulan Bator, who, according to Russian media, has already spoken with the Russian delegation.
The lock meets the real playoff troll: "The paint is tight"
Tappara and the Clave will continue today in Hakametsi as they are both on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that today we won't see a real goal party in Hakametsi.
Tappara went to Kuopio yesterday to carve 3-2-coffee from KalPa.
The rise was manly, for last season's silver team was at its worst the loss of two goals.
The lock's Tuesday was a lot more winning than it was.
The Rauman catch as a guest of Blues, who started a tangled start, was round zero points, and the loss figures were also 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if any play the same game as last year, Locker Janne Lahti anticipates layouts on the Society's website.
Tappara has become quite a playoff nightmare for the people of Rauma.
After all, Tappara has dropped the Clave in the semifinals in the previous two periods.
On both occasions, a decisive seventh match has been required.
Last season, the Clave took the series to the break in the fourth game, but Tappara rose in the next three by and by.
With the exception of goalies, there are no major changes in group configurations.
The cashiers who rejected both of them yesterday are getting a flute today.
With Tapara's goal Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Bear, and between the Clave poles Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Point of view: Ässissa is in the middle of a miserable play
The sports director Toivola wrote an inappropriate sequel to the head coach Rautakallio," writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote a Rocky movie in which he himself played the leading role.
Sensationally, the underdog struggled with the heavyweight champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a great deal of sympathy, even though he finally lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's premiere, Mika Toivola wrote a restless Cinderella story in Pori.
The anonymous and wooden casserole advanced to everyone's amazement at the SM finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but tough underdogs like Rocky.
There were white Indians, Pori Matt and Pele Pelto.
In the playoffs, the players dyed their heads red and cut the lorokes.
Hope child became blonde.
J.P. Jalo called the coach Neumann.
Aces took the silver that was won.
Hope was one of the heroes.
The writer Toivola believes that the new work of this season will work in the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports director of the Äss have built a casserole on bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been banging guys in the trough like Rocky pig carcasses at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen have earned something other than hockey.
Toivola has forgotten that in Rocky VI the lead is played by Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Stone has crossed the Iron Rock into Sean Connery.
The Iron Rock is as clumsy a lead performer as Connery would have been in the original 1976.
There's nothing else in Iron Rock but a nickname.
The game philosophy of iron rock does not include rushing and little pigs.
He appreciates the tough game, but it's one thing to play hard than a pig.
Last season, Ässien Garrett Stafford hit Tapara Jere Karjalainen on the head.
He got 2 plus 10 minutes from the judges, but Iron Rock put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only have those who deserve to play.
I don't approve of that kind of game, and it's not part of the ace hockey, the hot Iron Rock got a little cranky after the game for the Satakunta People.
The team of Ässien this season is strangely built.
There are juniors, veterans, cops, and bulldozers.
In practice, there are no key men of prime age.
No wonder the head coach's been complaining about a skill shortage.
How much have you been able to influence the acquisitions of players, Pekka Rautakallio?
Last season's events affect procurement and, unfortunately, the situation on the market was rather limited, Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
Underneath the surface, it's pulsating.
In the 1953 model, Rautakallio is known to be interested in moving to Toivola as a sports boss.
The men's contracts end in the spring.
The Äss' balance in the three league games of the season is as many losses in goal difference 1-6.
Hopela shouldn't have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santas' mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuukka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under the guidance of her husband.
Yes, I'm playing the mother of a friend of my husband's.
In a way, it seems crazy, and the actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
He has been married to Apulanna's ex-basist and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple has done a lot of work together before, but this is the first time Olga has played under Tuuka's direction.
Olga's role in Apulana's film "You Made Us Beautiful" is drummer Sipe Santasuki's mother Sirkka.
Sirkka tsemppa and supports his son, even though his father, Risto (presented by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I have become acquainted with my real role model, the easier it seems to be to play the role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuukka for trusting me with the role.
Olga had already met Sirka before the film project, but since then, the two of them have become much closer.
They've met. They've spoken on the phone. They've been texting.
Sirkka has helped so much.
We've been through a lot of different angles of their history.
Sirkka is also fortunate to understand that drama is drama and the truth may need some coloring.
Olga points out that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulana would become the largest band in Finland.
In the '90s, there was a recession and it was really sad.
There was little chance that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga tells us that she had heard a lot about Tuukka's youth even before the movie plans.
However, parents' stories have sometimes been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were doing.
Olga reveals that her youth was completely different from that of Tuukka, known as Heinola's infamous skate story.
Olga was an ark and a good girl who had nothing to do with Tuukka.
At the most, he could have secretly fallen in love.
According to Olga, he has worked so hard with Tuuka over the past 10 years that a big joint project does not scare him.
Everything has always gone super well.
Now the entire production team is leaving for a month's shoot in Heinola.
True, a couple living in Italy often plans to drive home for the sake of their young children because the distance is not too long.
We take all Heinola for a month.
They have welcomed us very warmly, simply asking which ones will repent and when will be emptied.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive play in Finland
The budget for the Iron Sky: The Coming Race film directed by Timo Vuorensola is EUR 17 million.
Descriptions will begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola starts filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
The sequel of the Scifi film Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will become Finland's most expensive play film of all time with a budget of EUR 17 million.
Previously, the title of Finland's most expensive film has been Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation will also rise after completion of Iron Sky 2, with a budget of over EUR 100 million.
Descriptions of the film directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa start in October near Antwerp in the AED Studios premises and last eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola will leave for Belgium next week.
A giant budget doesn't scare me.
I've been so sick and relaxed!
I feel so relaxed about the script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone in the task force seems to realize that we're doing something we've never seen before.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, he'll tell the Evening Magazine.
Originally, the budget for the film had been set at 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
It's a big budget, but it's a big story.
But you could shove 100 million into the film because every angle and effect is so expensive.
Now everything's so tight, it's not loose.
The film production company Iron Sky Universe launched today a crowdfunding campaign and a bond with an annual interest rate of between 4 and 8 per cent.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
In two years at the latest, the company will repay the loan.
The action film is played by Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junk or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Lately, the fronts of the Trendsters have been decorated with large logos.
Until recently, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
The advertising of a hoodie or a T-shirt was seen as a bit of a hillbilly.
It's times that change.
Sporting has become the real megatrend of fashion, and so have old, familiar sport fashion characters such as Adidas and Nike.
And as so often before, the line between funny and trendy is fluctuating: if something is already a real hillbilly, it begins to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. the mundane fashion, where the trendsetters surprised by favouring basic clothes that are as boring as possible as a way to separate themselves from the mass.
Now, instead of the grey standard college, you're going to have to put on that sweat shirt buried at the bottom of the closet, which is shown in front of the manufacturer's logo.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, Adidas's identifiable track-finders, favorite team's jerseys and New York Yankees hats have made a return to street fashion.
The beginning of the jeans' edge is now a cool detail for the Calvin Klein logos of the underwear.
The trend seems to be moving from sport brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the front of Versace's autumn sweaters makes it clear what clothing is to be worn.
Would you be ready to display logos in your dress?
The Russian politician released the evidence: I didn't get stuck in the tank door for hours!
According to claims, a special incident would have taken place in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015 was introduced to Russian war industry products.
In recent days, there have been colorful claims in the Russian media that the Russian Ministry of Emergency had to remove large Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything in his power to deny the information.
He even published a picture on his own public Facebook pages, where he seems to be peeking at the armored vehicle hatch in quite good moods and, at least, from those images, it's not about getting stuck or getting angry.
It's total nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't enter the battle tank, but it was the assault tank BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier myself, Lieutenant Colonel. I've served the Urals.
I went in there, looked around and came out in peace, Zotov said to Komosomolskaja Pravda.
I didn't get stuck, and I certainly didn't spend five hours in that position," he said.
On the Russian army TV channel Zotov explained that he saw Russian new technology in the exhibition because he was a former professional soldier himself.
That's why I was interested in what was inside the carriage, and I admired our technique.
And out I came through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And in the next exhibition I will definitely visit all the tanks and all the assault tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the writer a fool.
One fool wrote and all the others repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went in, and I came out.
I'm tall, I'm fat, but nothing like being stuck somewhere in a tank, it didn't happen," he said to Russkaya sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged sticking have been published, even though 50 000 people visited the weapons exhibition in a few days' time.
The claim that Zotov got stuck started in the case of the Bloknot.ru website, where Zotov was told that he was struggling to get out of the tank door and threatened eventually to shoot everyone around him if he didn't get out of his way.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up article in which the exhibition organizers gave their views on what happened.
Everyone is just used to soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles quickly.
But MP Zotov, due to his large size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he certainly did not sit there for five hours," said the exhibition coordinator Alexander Pisarevsky to Bloknot.
Here's a favorite item of interior bloggers.
The Architects Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) Lassen's candlestick from 1962 looks like it was planned today.
A cubed steel frame is like a work of art, and it was originally a work of art.
Architect brothers are known to have long and mathematically refined the shape of the chandelier.
At first it was introduced only to the distinguished guests of the gentlemen's dinner.
Kubus candles are manufactured by the family company By Lassen, which maintains the design heritage of famous brothers.
The candles are handmade in Holstebro, Denmark, in versions of eight, four and one candles, in four different colours.
The Kubu can be black, white and the nickel and copper shakes.

There has been a leak in the Kittilän mine of Agnico Eagle Finland, a Canadian-owned mining company.
The refined process water from the gold mine has been drained from the so-called enrichment pool into a ditch.
According to the company, measures to correct the leak have been initiated.
The pool contains neutralised enrichment sand and purified process water from the foaming process.
In general, water is pumped either for re-use as process water or led through the surface drainage field to the environment as agreed.
The bleeding was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was observed.
According to the company, the quality of leakage water meets the current permit conditions.
There was no other material in the environment.
The leak was detected during the inspection round on Monday morning.
The leak has not been found to cause structural damage to the dam structures of the pool.
The company reports that it cooperates closely with the authorities to monitor and remedy the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish country report published today by the IMF largely follows the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation pushed Finland towards comprehensive structural reforms to deal with economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the whole contractual system and for unemployment protection.
According to Danske Bank's chief economist Pasi Kuoppamäki, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
The IMF's assessment contains a lot of sympathetic messages for government action, but on the other hand, there are also words of warning about what should not be cut too much.
These include infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki says to Talous sanomat.
In the view of the IMF, growth projects should also be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF anticipates economic growth of 0.4% for Finland this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
Danske expects this year, in his new forecast for the economic cycle, that growth will fall to zero.
The IMF is a little more optimistic about this year.
They may have had some of the latest observations.
This morning Statistics Finland reported that total output was growing slightly in the summer," Kuoppamäki says.
Less attention could be paid to the weakened industry's confidence or other so-called softer indicators.
However, these differences are limited to a few percentage points.
Nintendo, who was recovering from death, appointed a new leader.
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will start working on Wednesday," Nintendo told me on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for launching a successful Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to track Iwata's footprints, evaluated by Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
Kimishima's task is to bring Nintendo into mobile games strongly, but not to eat the company's bread on the side of traditional gaming consoles.
More and more minor asylum seekers arrive alone in Finland
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service recognised that hundreds of children who have entered the country disappear every year.
According to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of minor applicants disappear each year, among other things, on their websites OSF.se and Dagens Nyheter.
The Finnish Immigration Service's Chief Inspector Juha Kannelmaa tells us what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is it the same in Finland?
How many applicants disappear "under the country" per year?- A total of 156 applications for asylum were made in Finland in 2013.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014, similar applications were made in 196 and 11 of them disappeared," says Kannelmaa.
The reason for this disappearance may be that it is clear from the case that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of age there.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue the proceedings in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for examining the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, the total number of asylum seekers in Finland was 3651, of which 134 were closed because the applicant had probably moved away from Finland, so that adult asylum seekers disappeared in the last 123 years," he says.
Is the number on the increase?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum for a minor who has come alone.
The overall statistics on missing minors this year are not yet available, but the number of minors applicants is known and has increased clearly, which is likely to also affect the number of missing persons, he stresses.
What about those who have been converted?
Will they also disappear, for example, into the "dark labour market"?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for implementing the decisions to convert, Kannelmaa stresses.
Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered applicants.
He has taken action on this issue.
At the EU Home Affairs Council, Orpo, who discussed refugee issues, explained on Monday how to manage the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see pictures of the equipment
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkose for TV and radio productions is now available for sale.
Mikkonen's spouse Nina Mikkonen sells equipment at Huuto.net, which was once one of the most advanced professional tools in her field.
The online announcement was the first one to tell about the online magazine Nightmacan.
Today, a large part of the equipment has been overshadowed by technological progress.
In the digital media world, television shows are no longer on Betacam.
However, Nina Mikkonen is confident that there will be interested ones.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date, but these are needed as long as there is old generation material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of enthusiasts - collectors and studio builders, Nina Mikkonen says to IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset is trying to move out of his current home in the Stormlän.
There's no way we can take all the stuff with us.
I've gradually begun to inventory and see what goods are being disposed of.
This is where I started," says Nina Mikkonen.
There is no use for TV and radio equipment.
After recent strokes, it is clear that the man who made a long career will never return to work again.
Nina Mikkonen points out that only goods and equipment are sold now.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen's actual life's work was filed at the National Audiovisual Institute in the summer, whose representatives went to pick up boxes of films and other material from Stormylä.
Traffic threatens to grow worse than expected: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
Metro and tram drivers today decide whether to extend the force measures in connection with Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram traffic only during Friday's demonstration.
During the afternoon, it will be resolved whether traffic will stop all day.
Pekka Hirvonen, head of trust, says that he's big on the field.
The cuts in the night and shift lines are very painful for the drivers, so the government's plans to cut the flats raise opposition.
Hirvonen thinks that stopping traffic all day, however, is a sort of dilemma.
If the metro and tram stop by Friday, public transport in the Greater Helsinki area is almost completely at a standstill.
According to VR's data, trains do not run between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Friday.
On Friday, there is no commuter or long distance traffic.
Trains left before 6 a.m. will be driven to the stations of destination.
According to HSL's data, most of the buses remain in the depot.
ACP Members are absent from work on Friday from 3 a.m. to 3 a.m. Saturday morning at 3 a.m.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven; they are driven by superiors, according to Pirkko Repo, HSL's publicist.
Repo says HSL can't tell you exactly which bus services are scheduled on Friday.
The employees' organisations organise a major demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Market on Friday between 11 am and 13 pm.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place on the Hungarian-Serbia border, where many refugees are trying to move on to Europe, reports the news agency AP.
Sky News says the refugees have been trying to break through the border fence.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water cannons against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at a school in Texas, and the teacher thought it was a bomb.
In the United States of America, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested since the teacher held the self-made watch he brought to school as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that all he wanted to do was show off his electronic hobby.
However, one of the teachers considered the clock to be like a bomb.
The police were called, and the situation ended with the boy being handcuffed to a juvenile detention cell.
At no point has Mohammed been found to have claimed anything other than that he had made a watch.
Yet it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a fake bomb.
Mohamed said the police had found that the watch looked like a movie bomb.
The watch is in police custody, but it was reportedly composed of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident occurred last Monday and Mohamed was punished for three days of compulsory school leave.
His father is furious about the case and the American-Islamic Council is wondering whether this case is yet another demonstration of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain's tumultuous - Labour leader refused to sing the national anthem
In the song, God is asked to protect the queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism of the right-wing press has also been shared by the representatives of the Corbyn Labour Party.
This has offended the people, said Labour MP Kate Green in a radio interview with the BBC.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
Last night's memorial service honored the battle of British air force pilots against German Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corbyn in an official statement and stresses that he has shown respect for the pilots by participating in the event.
We all owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood with respect in silence during the national anthem, the statement was emphasized.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided Labour's ranks.
Among the MPs, in particular, are those who fear that he will banish moderate voters with his radical views.
Corby is in favour of unilateral disarmament, ending austerity measures and increasing public spending.
Today, for the first time, Corbyn is to be a party leader in Parliament at Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what should be asked of Prime Minister David Cameron.
At the turn of the week Cameron was on Twitter about Corbyn's election as party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, our financial security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister tweeted in his own account.
The reason for the family killing in Minnesota is still unclear - the father of the family was facing a lawsuit.
The South Lake Mintonka Police Department has been investigating the family murder in Greenwood, Minnesota for almost a week.
A family of five was found dead in their home on September 10, and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the family's father, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting first his wife and three children, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days.
The family was found after the school had been concerned about the absence of children.
Based on this announcement, the police went to the house for a visit and found the Short family dead across a huge house.
According to StarTribune, it's possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A million-dollar house and a successful business
The case of Michael Siitar, Chief of Police of South Lake Mintonka, is still under investigation.
The motive for the blood work is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property on the social media site AllNurses.com for nurses.
In 2014, in an interview with StarTribune Short reported that there were four million different visitors to the site every week.
I've had 50 bids made for the company in the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to put into practice.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
Among other things, success was shown by the fact that the Short family bought a hilarious house in Greenwood in 2011 for $2 million.
The house is advertised as the dream of a car collector in Zillow: the house has not only 12 rooms but also a garage sufficient for eight cars.
A case pending
But according to StarTribune, the father of the family was facing a lawsuit.
Achieve Test Prep, offering various prepping courses, had sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, no abusive comments had been removed from Short's website and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on Short's transactions.
Vesku Loiri offered me a coffee cake.
In addition, the owner's trio was awarded at the race event with the Finnish Hippos Monthly Horse Owner Award.
This is great. Loiri commented in good mood on his honor board.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100 000 euros.
Artist legend Loiri was still confused by Fabrice Duo's success in the major competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
According to Loir, Coach Raven of the Success Horse will have complete peace of mind while working with the horse.
Pekka orders and decides where to take the horse to compete.
And I'm gonna shut up, Loiri.
It's an amazing gesture from an NHL star - "The greatest contribution ever made by an athlete"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated ten million dollars (about 6.7 million euros) to Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the hospital's announcement, this is the greatest single donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital with other fundraising for the next seven years.
A year ago, Subban signed a contract with the Canadiens worth eight years and 72 million dollars.
Subban's donation is thus significantly higher than his $9 million annual income.
As a reward for his donation, Subban receives a lobby space bearing his name from the hospital.
Canadiens players have done much to help local hospitals in the past.
A year ago, long-term captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a giant sum of money for another city's major hospital to get the PET scanner needed for cancer research.
A Japanese café can be ordered by a wife for the evening, serving food with a bikini and an apron on its head.
Theme cafes are tough in Japan.
There's already a goat café, a rabbit café, a vampire café, a hug shop and now a wife café.
It strikes the lonely, the sore, the hungry.
There's a Metro report.
You can order a wife or husband for your evening at an Ore no Yome (My wife) café in Tokyo.
It's a waitress pretending to be the client's spouse.
The "half-family" is selected from the list before coming to the café and he prepares and serves the food.
The wife is facing an apron and a bikini with her husband in tight bike shorts.
The website provides all the information about the length of the wife candidates and always places pressure on the type of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: attacks against car security began to be armed
The Automation Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the sector, says Intel's release.
The Board is composed of top experts in the field of security from around the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections to standardise best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of best practices in cybersecurity.
The company will update the report on the basis of the ASRB's research results.
The international ICT research and consulting company Gartner estimates that by 2020 approximately 150 million vehicles in traffic will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share network-based data.
We can and must improve cybersecurity in cars," says Chris Young, Director of Intel Security.
With the help of ASRB, Intel can consolidate safety-related best practices and support the view that cybersecurity is a significant ingredient in the design of every car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in data processing.
Ford Focus RS costs approximately 52 000 euros in Finland!
Ford's Focus RS model has been expected for years like a moon-rise.
Finally, the car is also on the horizon in Finland.
Ford released RS's information now that the car world's eyes are at the Frankfurt Car Show.
Ford's new four-wheeled RS accelerates with its 2.3-litre, 350-horsepower engine in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and has a peak speed of 266 kilometers per hour.
The price is also interesting according to Finnish, and it is provisionally reported to be EUR 52 000.
The car is already available to order, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford does not state in his release.
The favourite brand Kia introduced two new features at the Frankfurt car show - the new Sportage and Optima
In Finland, the new fourth generation Sportage is certainly more important than the two new ones, with which Kia plans to grab a larger slice of the constantly growing SUV market.
The Sportage created under the leadership of Gregory Guillaume, the new European Design Director, is more round than before.
An inch has come into the space between the axles and the external dimensions, and the car splits the air more efficiently.
The engine range is broadly unchanged, but a 1.6-litre turbo with 177 horsepower has been added.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported closer to coming to the market.
We will have to wait a little longer for that, as we will have a new Sportage in spring 2016.
Even before the year's change, new Kia Optimat arrived in our country.
Suddenly, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a whole new car.
Kia plans to conquer the hearts of upper middle class buyers with better driving characteristics, lower noise levels and higher quality equipment.
The starting point is to obtain Optimos with 1.7-litre turbodiesel and 2.0-litre petrol engines.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate as Optima GT, equipped with a 2.0-litre turbo engine, arrives alongside them.
At the same time, the sales of Optima Farmer begin with its arrival.
Chisu went back to the pallets in a bold jumpsuit.
Singer Chisu is at the Life for the Child concert with other Finnish stars.
There's a nice, open neck hole in an electric-blue pants suit.
The costume presents beautifully the slender waist of the singer star.
The whole thing is crowned by a golden metal belt and a red lipstick.
During a three - year break, a singer who has become a mother has been able to lose her weight with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to turn into a year.
The singer released her first single on a new album in August.
I'm not really nervous about getting back on stage and getting in front of the public after a long break.
I've missed all the music-related activities, the singer says.
In a couple of weeks, Chisu will release his new and fourth album called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired the creation of new songs.
At this point I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu will think.
Kim Kardashian's maternity style is astounding again. Now you see the breast.
The true beauty Kim Kardashian gives talks one after another.
He presents his pregnant stomach and chest equipment freely in sexy clothes, last night at one American time when he and his sister Kourtney Kardashian left husband Kanye West's concert.
The black maternity dress is transparent on the breasts.
It reveals the color of the bra under the dress as lightning lights flash.
The last time Kardashian wore an Amazonic maternity dress was when he visited a friend at a dinner party in New York just a few days ago.
The outfit was highlighted by black overpile boots.
The third special maternity outfit is as fresh as last week's Friday, when the show was in pregnancy.
The hard laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, competition is terrible
The top model Manon Leloup wanted to shorthand the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary "Speaking Dolls" in which Leloup and his colleagues speak out of the model business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar compiled Leloup's six hard truths from behind the scenes.
Every season starts out of nowhere.
Even if you were in top designer costumes in the previous season, the new season will begin again with Castings.
And every season, new, fresh faces come into the industry that compete with corporates for work.
Models rarely have a place to call home.
The work is continuous travel and may take a year to stay in a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearable.
New York and Paris are the jobs they want, but they're the most stressful.
There's not just one kind of skinnyness.
Agent New York may ask to drop kilos, but in Paris they say you're too skinny.
Getting a job is always a risky game.
In fashion weeks, models and designers are always together and act as a support network at the same time.
When fashion weeks are over, it's a pain in the ass.
The models want this sector to be able to do so, but they are consumed by the fact that everyone thinks that work is just a showdown of clothes.
Even models want to be their own personalities.
Work makes models feel like they're actors with a role.
But you can also express yourself in the work of the model.
Models yesterday at Tory Burch's show.
New York is currently celebrating fashion weeks, where designers will reveal their next year's collection.
Scrooge Salminen, who changed his style, plays the most unknown Apulanta musician in the film.
Scrooge Salminen performs Antti Lautala, the founding member of the band, in a film based on the Apulanta band in the early years.
Lautala founded Apulana in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but resigned from the band in 1994.
It's a big challenge for me, because I'm a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitar player, Salminen laughs.
I've never wanted to meet the real Antti before the shoot because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Clearly, Antti is the most unknown to people in that group, so I think it's all right that I learn his play style only from video.
I don't want to do an impression of a human being.
A man who pilotes the Scrooge Salminen and the Dogs band will not go into character.
The Punk Manners come naturally with the man.
I'm sure there were a lot of people who saw a foretaste in the punk episode of Stars, Stars, and Stars, if they've ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been anything small, but we always go to the fullest.
The main actors in Tuukka Temonen, who played bass in Apula in 1993-2004, were announced today.
The group of young actors who have become familiar with the audience is presented to the general public by young actors who are still quite unknown.
The drummer Sipe Santapukki is played by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtasta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Timosta Iiro Panula.
Scrooge Salminen gave a tip about his future job last night when he mysteriously told Snapchat that he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Scrooge has already published yesterday in Instagram a picture of his new look that he has had to carry out for the film.
Scrooge, previously seen in the mustache and chin beard, has shaved his face into smooth cheeks and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to think about how to tell the child about the situation of refugees seeking to enter Europe.
Or is it worth telling you about it at all?
You don't have to talk about it by force, member of the SPR crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
Smaller children are worth protecting, not letting them watch the news alone, for example.
Small children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay in mind and distress, he says.
However, if a child has come across a television news picture of refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth talking about.
It is good to have a discussion about the child's starting points and to listen carefully to what he asks.
The child's fears may be surprising.
They may not be the ones the parent thinks he is afraid of.
You don't want to scare a child for nothing, even if you're anxious and scared.
A smaller child closely follows the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will feel safe too.
Larger children are likely to come across a discussion about refugees at school, with friends or online.
Parents do well to bring it up with them if the child is concerned.
The fact is, not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents, together with children, may wonder how this is viewed in our family.
In the end, however, do we think the world is a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational aspects - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand, if the family also talks about difficult things, the child will get a model of how to deal with the difficulties that arise in life.
This could be useful for him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljanmaa: "Teach your children to help the weaker"
Your own strength at the end?
You can still be a good parent to your child
It's hard to control the Pallosalamaa that hits Vermo.
Perttu Pohjola was able to fine-tune Apila's Pallosalama in midsummer.
It was only going to win and take second place until the end of July in Tampere raves came to collapse.
Since the stallion was completely clotted, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered an appointment with the vet.
The explanation for the shutdown was clear in the lookout.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not the mildest in the head, but it took two pills to overcome it.
Since Apila's Pallosalama had to be in light exercise, Pohjola says that he is positively surprised by the last race of the horse.
It was in Turku in its record time the second SE-mother after the wind of legend.
The Pallosalama of Apila was under great pressure from the break when it had normally only been able to drive for a few weeks.
In view of those things, the slight deflection at the end was understandable, says the North.
The coach assumes that a proper competition was good for the stallion.
The horse's spirit certainly went on from there, and hopefully it would also have stabilized.
Apila's Pallosalama has been called humorous horses.
When you haven't had the pleasure, it could have thrown you fat without getting sick.
On a good day, however, the Ori have been cut off by such a lightning bolt that the opponents have been amazed.
In short speed, rivals can't compete with Pallosalama, who even loses warm-blooded rides.
In the hopes of the North there is a race in Vermo.
But the different thing is, how does Apila's Pallosalama agree to it?
It's kind of hard at the time of departure, and you know, it might pop under the boom of the starting car or something like that.
I hope the stallion is calmer by now than Turku's departure.
Apilan Pallosalama can also come from the bow when he is well, and we're going to ride it for victory, coach says.
This is why you can't get rid of useless iPhone programs.
Tim Cook, CEO of Apple.
At least some of the software that comes with Apple's iPhone phones may be able to be deleted sometime in the future - but not all.
Apple will possibly remove some of its own software from iPhone phones in the future," says Tim Cook, CEO of the company in an interview with Buzzfeed magazine.
Apple's iPhone features a number of programs that are relatively few to use: For example FaceTime calls, Lehtikioski, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which came as a forced upgrade to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple's smart watch owners.
Cook says that removing Apple's software is more complicated than it looks.
Some applications are linked to someone else on the iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone," Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple iPhone apps work closely with other programs.
There are other programmes that do not work this way.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
So, according to Cook, Apple is looking into it because the company doesn't want to waste memory space on users' iPhone phones.
Inflation in the euro area fell to 0.1 per cent in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only marginally in August, or by 0.1% from one year ago, as reported by Eurostat, the EU statistical authority.
The rise in prices was driven down by lower energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised its estimate of 0.2% from a couple of weeks ago slightly downwards.
In July, inflation was 0.2 per cent.
So-called underlying inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's estimate of underlying inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2% cheaper last month than one year ago.
The average inflation rate in the EU of 28 countries was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
Consumer prices in Malta rose most in August, or 1.4 per cent, from the euro countries.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest at 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent minus the mark according to the EU's harmonised price index.
Inflation in the euro area remains persistently far away from the European Central Bank's (ECB) target of 2% increase in prices over the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
Next year the rise will pick up to 1.1%, the central bank anticipates in its new inflation forecasts announced at the beginning of September.
The US Fed is now trying to tighten monetary policy
The next recession in the United States will begin in less than a year's time, but more assuredly within three years after the country's Central Bank, Fed, takes up interest rates again for a long time.
And in the financial markets, the decline begins before the next recession.
FedEx has hinted that it might start raising interest rates this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession can hit us at its fastest by next autumn and as a financial market rate squeeze before then.
Or at least this is what will happen if the world's largest economy and financial markets function as they used to do - and if they react to the blackmail of Fed's money taps as they have done in the past.
These conclusions have been drawn by the German bank Deutsche Bank's London Market Survey strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The Bank distributed a more than 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to its international major customers last week.
The strategists who drew up the study and report do not pretend to know exactly when FedEx will start to raise interest rates or what will happen in the economy and in the market afterwards.
Instead, they present, through the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics, how the economy and the market have behaved in the past at and after Fed's interest rates.
In addition to historical observations, they will examine which key variables in the economy and financial markets are now on the same or different model as in previous interest rates - and what may result from it.
It becomes clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now more flimsy to bear the rise in interest rates than ever before in the 1950s.
♪ Not even a year before the recession started ♪
The leaders who decided on Fedi's monetary policy and its current stance have hinted throughout last summer and early autumn that the time is beginning to be ripe for raising interest rates.
The first increase in interest rates for more than nine years may already occur this week.
The matter will be resolved during Wednesday and Thursday when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Board of Directors of Fedi meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
Last time, FedEx raised its so-called ‘Fed funds' steering rate in June 2006.
That was the end of a series of relatively regular but small interest rates of 0.25 percentage points for exactly two years, with FedEx increasing its interest rates from 1.25% to 5.25%.
The symptoms of the financial markets began in 2007 with the difficulties of the US's most risky housing financing, and one year later the financial crisis ruptured into a global doomsday nightmare.
A major recession occurred in 2009.
Last time, severe adverse events in financial markets and the real economy started at a slower pace than has typically occurred since the previous Fed interest rates.
Similarly, the trials were tougher and harsher than ever since the depression of the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategies have screened the rise and fall of the world's largest economies and the turn of financial markets since 1950 and in some places since the beginning of the 19th century.
Fedi's interest rates and their economic and financial impact will be reported by them from the 1950s onwards.
It has taken less than a year, mostly less than three years, and on average less than three and a half years, at the fastest time since the first rate increase.
The increase in the exchange rate on the financial markets has ended within two years of the start of Fedi's interest rates.
In turn, FedEx has increased its steering rate and, in turn, reduced its steering rate since the early 1950s by a dozen cycles of different lengths.
Each time there have been differences between others, and there are relatively few times in the review, so it is unlikely that there will be any certainty as to the effects of the subsequent interest rates.
The strategies remind us that this time many things are different.
And not just better.
Interests too low for too long
The decisive causes of the financial crisis, let alone those responsible, may not be established beyond doubt even by decades of research.
But there are three things that have led to the crisis and which have contributed to its destructive power, and I think it is quite clear:
1) In the 21st century, Fed, the euro area ECB and the other largest central banks in the world considered their key interest rates too low for too long.
They patched up the tech bubble tracks, and they grew the next one at the same time.
2) Over the decades, the accumulated and already excessive amount of debt in the various parts of the financial and real economy grew even greater as a result of the excessive monetary policy of central banks.
The largest debt bubble in economic history until then was created.
3) In particular, crazy debt financing, which was almost unbridled in the financial economy, swelled the biggest exchange rate bubbles in the history of financial markets from shares to real estate, debt securities and commodities.
Even so, there is hardly much controversy that the financial markets that have risen to a height on increasingly complex debt lines were in a particularly dangerous and unstable state of affairs, as Fed and the other central banks last pushed interest rates up.
The financial structures on debt lines, let alone the valuation bubbles, did not last until after the rate increases had started and the cost of debt financing had turned up.
The risks were realised in the financial crisis and followed by a major recession.
A bigger bubble and more debt
Deutsche's strategists do not guess what will happen next, but give rise to a shock by mentioning, for example:
1) Fed and other large central banks have now considered their monetary policy stance to be even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower.
2) For a long time, debt has not been crazier than it was ten years ago, but now debt money is literally cheaper than free money.
Thus, the debt burden of the financial and real economy has not been reduced, but now, in various parts of the economy, a much heavier debt burden than before or never before in the financial crisis.
3) Liquidity from the central banks, which is more frequent and cheaper than before, has largely remained on the financial markets and has reached the highest level of the main securities and assets, whether at the peak or ever before the financial crisis.
And not only with financial market warnings, they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and from the worst recession in decades.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is unusually weak, but correspondingly, the pressures and risks of the financial markets are comparatively higher than before the financial crisis when FedEx next starts to tighten its financial stakes.
Maybe the future of Albert Edwards, the future of the French bank Societe Generale strategist, isn't as strange as it suddenly seems.
He has been preparing the Bank's international investors for Fedi's next round-off:
First, Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst, and soon it's time for Fedin to run off with even bigger QE money syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a manufacturer of computers and printers, intends to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the deductions are for HP's business services," says the company.
HP is divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which focuses on business sales, and HP Inc., which focuses on Pc machines and printers for consumers.
HP had the highest number of personnel in 2011 when it had 350000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302,000.
The company records non-recurring expenses of USD 2.7 billion (about EUR 2.4 billion).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be reduced to 25000-30000 employees.
Reductions on the consumer side will remain at 3,300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its activities to low-cost countries with 60% of its employees in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers is responsible for more than 10% of its operating result.
In the year before last, its three main customers imported 65 per cent of the operating result.
iOS 9: Apple publishes a new operating system – this is how you install it on iPhone
The new operating system can be installed first by selecting Settings, General and Software Update.
If your phone is ready for the upgrade, it will tell you to download and install a new operating system.
Some users have experienced problems since installation: an error report has appeared on the phone "upgrade software failed".
In the event of an error, users are advised to wait for the congestion to break out or to try to update via iTunes.
The phone will guide you in the download process.
The update may require the removal of applications in order to release space. However, Apple has made the update more compact. In addition, there is a tool that proposes to remove applications and reinstall them after the update.
When updating the software, it is advisable to ensure that the phone is charged and that the charger is available so that the power does not run out during the download.
If the charge level is too low, the phone does not allow the upgrade to start. If the battery of the phone is emptying during the upgrade, the upgrade may be broken.

Yle: Minister Berner has served on the board of the tax haven company
Ms Anne Berner, Minister for Transport and Communications (Kesk.) has been a member of the Board of Directors of the tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company's activities involve so-called tax planning.
It is a Luxembourg-based company called Salti II LuxCo, whose Board of Directors Berner was appointed in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Business Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Board.
Berner himself says he filed a resignation notice in May of this year.
I checked it out, and that's enough for me to file a notice of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration chains take place within the agreed timeframe," Berner says in Yle's interview.
Membership after merger
The ownership of the Swedish company Kährs is managed through the Luxembourg company.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner was a board member of Karelia-Upoflor from 2010 to 2013 and, following the merger, was a board member of Kährs and a Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, the holdings of Kährs are carried out in Luxembourg through a multi-stage ownership structure.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted board membership at the request of Kährs' second largest owner in Luxembourg.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been on the board of Karelia-Upoflor owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was looking for a partner that was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a venture capital investor who has a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that it was my job to ensure that the benefits of the capital of the Finnish family company were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the income from our Finnish companies' capital is taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context," Berner says.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's ownership of the company does not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure of the tax haven is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs' private equity fund Triton already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for its ownership.
Espoo opens a reception centre maintained by the company
Espoon Otaniemi opens the first reception centre maintained by the company for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants already today, starting at 6 p.m.
The number of seats may increase within one week to a maximum of 300-400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre in the real estate of the former Rescue College.
The operations are maintained by Luona Oy, which is particularly active in the production of healthcare and medical services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy jointly agree on security arrangements for the Centre.
STK is preparing an alternative blackmail package for working life
GTK will start preparing an alternative package for the blackmail of the government's working life.
The organisation also wishes to include other employee centre organisations.
According to President Antti Palola, attention is currently being paid to Friday's demonstration.
Alternative ways of reducing the cost of work are then returned.
Everyone understands that life goes on after Friday," Palola pointed out to journalists during the break of the organization's administration meeting.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) is not prepared for discussion.
STK economists have calculated that the security of change provided by the Government's Competitiveness Package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, compared to EUR 2,700 million on the other side of the package.
I don't know if there's a lot of enthusiasm on the part of the party to have a conversation if you're getting one to 100.
Palola: The negotiation link has been constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Kesk.) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, as the government will then issue a communication on its own package to the Parliament and start preparing reforms.
Palola did not comment on whether the timetable was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a dialogue with the government and it has been constructive all along.
According to Palola, surgery on Sunday supplements is a painful place for staff central organisation STTTK.
The organisation requires the government to withdraw from the mandatory legislation by which it is carrying out part of the blackmail.
According to Palola, the TTK does not want the alternative package to be prepared with the SDP.
Employees meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the Finnish Government's blackmail package presented last week.
As part of the package, for example, the wages of the first days of illness are cut, overtime payments are cut by half, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75 per cent and holidays are reduced.
It is stressed from the STK that the central organisations have invited employees to a demonstration and the intention was not to organise a strike.
Akavan Fjäder thanks
Mr Sture Fjäder, President of Akava, congratulates the STEK on preparing an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now in line with Akava, as Akava has been developing an alternative model for government performances for a longer time.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without SAK the package will not be comprehensive enough.
Mr Sture Fjäder, President of Akava, hopes that the SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will join us in preparing the proposal as an alternative to the cuts.
Antti Palola's STK told us earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, Alava announced that it has been preparing its own proposal for a five per cent competitive jump as an alternative to cuts.
The Akava has been ready to negotiate all along, and we have long been writing an alternative model for government performances.
We are prepared to look at the terms of employment as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks," says Chairman Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to Akava's line, as GTK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model for the government and employers of the country," says Fjäder.
The Akava Bureau will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to take a decision on the possible content of the agreement.
"The same boat, the common coal, the juvies" - playing bingo while Sipilä talks at night
Tampere University Green Left
Viva bingo coupon for the Green Left for the evening at the University of Tampere.
The prime ministers have previously given exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on Yle's channels on Wednesday night at 9:05 p.m.
A similar speech by the Prime Minister must go to 1932 when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister when he gave the famous radio speech, which marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
After that, the President and Ministers gave several radio talks during the winter and the further war.
In the 1990s Esko Aho gave a New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the strike of train performers with a television speech.
Single phone call, monarchy.
Sipilä's speech has been a source of criticism and speculation all day long about what is to come.
Paavo Arhinmäki, Chairman of the Left Alliance, said on Twitter that "Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a Prime Minister's announcement, so that the speech could also be discussed".
According to Green Ville Niinistö, "one call has already been seen.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
The SDP's Erkki Tuomija condemned on Facebook that "monarchist action: the Prime Minister will tell the people what is best for it".
Antti Rinne, Chairman of the SDP, challenged Sipilä's dialogue: "Soon six months after the elections.
Not a single appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's been tried.
What are you afraid of?
Public service
According to the Government Office, Sipilä's speech is recorded in advance and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it was commented on live by Lauri Lyly, President of SAK, and Jyri Häkämies, CEO of EK.
There have been criticisms of Sipilä's speech.
We considered the matter and stated that it was part of the public service mission to promote comprehensive publicity throughout Finland, a line in the news of Yle's publications Director Ismo Silvo Yle.
♪ Like We were in Tammelas ♪
The speech has also sparked ridicule.
When the evening comes, the dinner will be enjoyed well in advance, the children will be combed and dressed for their best.
My mom puts on a prettier jacket and my dad puts a tie around his neck.
At nine o'clock, the television will be silenced as it was in the days of the old Me Tammelas," writes the blogger Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä also say in his speech why there are millionaires in the Finnish government who hide their capital in tax havens, who draw up pardon laws for their fellow tax collectors and at the same time claim to the people that it is necessary to cut when the state is running out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
On what Sipilä says, one guess is made by the Green Left Viva of the University of Tampere.
It has published the bingo on Facebook.
Will we be hearing about the same boat, the common coal, the debt and team spirit tonight?
The coupons and pens are ready, at 9:05 it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Arena.
Ahtisaari Guardian: The Western countries rejected Russia's proposal to replace al-Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected Russia's offer to get Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to give up power, says to President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the UN proposed a plan that would, after some time, have given up power in style.
However, the Western countries did not take up the proposal because they believed that al-Assad would fall anyway within a few weeks.
In 2012, Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed three points in the bilateral debate: the opposition was not to be armed, the opposition had to be contacted immediately and the resignation of al-Assad had to be carried out in a subdued manner.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on all things, but we are able to discuss them openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said, "Sit down, Martti, and I'll tell you what we have to do," Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
There's no comment from diplomats.
Ahtisaari reports that he has transmitted Tshurkin's message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion to the magazine, but according to Ahtisaari there are no two words about it.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's arguments, but said that al-Assad's forces had already committed several massacres at that time and the main opposition groups refused any agreements that would have left him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former director of the Middle East Department of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is hesitant about the speeches of Ahtisaari, because, according to his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari's claim is that Tshurkin spoke with Moscow's mandate.
If he had told me about what Tshurkin said, I would have answered that I wanted to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
Jenkins said that even if he did, he would have suspected that it was Putin's trick to keep power on some al-Assad supporter.
The River of Refugees — Our Own Works
During the negotiations on Ahtisaari, some 7 500 people had died during the Syrian crisis.
According to UN estimates, the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have had to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own doing.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we ourselves caused," Ahtisaari says to the magazine.
Centre for the Organisation of Asylum Applicants to impose on Tornio
The organisation centre for asylum seekers designed by the Government in Northern Finland is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in the empty building of the Tornio joint operation in the city center.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable place to better control the influx of refugees from the Swedish border.
On Tuesday, Helsingin Sanomat announced that the Board of Governors would have already decided to present the school building as a space solution to the Ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppinen (left) of the Tornio City Council, this is not true.
When the whole council was not together and some of the group wanted a formal decision, we decided to invite the council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he will specify to the STT.
There were 36 delegates from 43 present at the meeting.
13 delegates opposed the Organization Centre.
Based on this, you could expect a positive decision," Hyöppinen says.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday and the response was rapid.
An estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time could be accommodated in the joint declaration.
The expert has visited to check that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a few hundred meters from the border, so it would also work in that sense," says Nousiainen.
Sipilä still wants an alternative to blackmail from the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Kesk.), half of the holiday money in the public domain would only cover part of the government's efforts to reduce the cost of work.
However, the government will be happy to accept an alternative package if the social partners manage to agree on such a package.
Mr Sipilä told journalists in Parliament that he had not been in contact with the social partners.
He also did not know how seriously organisations were looking for compensatory measures for the blackmail of working life announced by the government.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä's view, the halving of the locusts would be a tool, since it would affect almost all employees, unlike, for example, the government's planned cut in Sunday supplements.
Labour market organisations could agree on a cut in holiday money because they have been written down in collective agreements rather than in law.
The government will be reporting to the Parliament next Wednesday on the blackmail of working life in the form of a government communication.
According to Sipilä, the proposals from the organisations should be known before this.
This is not the final deadline either.
The legislative work will then start, i.e. the train will be on the move and it will become increasingly difficult.
There's plenty of time.
It won't take long for things like this to happen if there's a will, Sipilä formulated it.
The list published by the government last week includes, among other things, the conversion of Loppipainen and Helatorsta into unpaid holidays without shortening annual working hours.
In addition, the wages for the first days of sickness are cut, overtime payments are reduced by half, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
Reforms are carried out as mandatory legislation past the trade unions, which has given rise to strong criticism.
As a result of these activities, the wage-paying central organisations will organise a major demonstration on Friday, and several trade unions have announced political strikes.
The council of Tohmajärvi approved the expansion of the Mahlahall warehouse
The council of Tohmajärvi unanimously approved the extension of the warehouse of Nordic Koivu Oy, or Mahlahall.
The criticism was that the project was bigger and more expensive than was originally said.
Also a busy schedule with heartburn.
It was also a little surprised that the need for space was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of the warehouse at 400-450 m2 was approved for the investment programme, but the money will be decided on in the context of the interim report.
There was still talk of an investment of between EUR 150 000 and EUR 200 000 on the agenda, but at the meeting, Technical Director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be approximately EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it brings work and tax revenue to the locality.
There is no risk for the municipality, as the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) explained.
There is room for Karelian language in Joensuu
The City Council eased its previous sharp stance to bring street name signs in Karelian to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct in terms of preserving Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of Karelian language because there are no historical grounds for it and Karelian language is not a natural part of the region's identity.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more part of the eastern Savonian dialects.
Even after a new decision, there will be no Karelian street name signs in the city center.
However, the City of Joensuu is ready to use the Karelian language on a case-by-case basis, for example in information boards and tourism marketing.
The city recommends the same approach to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a one-language municipality, it is also worth a broad-minded approach to the use of Karelian language now that multiculturalism lives and changes strongly in North Karelia.
Karelian language is still a peculiarity of the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the whole of Finland's forest capital.
Both can well be used in the wide range of marketing in the province.
The closure of train connections will cut the vitality of the province
Train cuts hit the vitality of the province with a hard hand.
Transport links directly affect the region's business life and competitiveness.
And that makes it possible to live and work here at all, says Kari Karjalainen, Mayor of Joensuu.
He also points out the issue of air transport, which has also been followed on several occasions in the report.
It is important for the whole province that we do not have the opportunity to reduce our chances of doing so by state intervention, as is now happening.
We should look at the impact of these closures on employment, for example, Karjalainen stresses.
The deterioration of accessibility poses a further challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees," says Jukka Mönkkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor access also affects the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot due to research.
Marko Junkrinen, Head of Recruitment, says that marketing the university towards Western Finland is already difficult because the connections are weak in a transverse direction.
Currently, about half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
Of them, about 10-20 percent are from New Zealand, which is partly explained by a direct train connection.
Joensuu became one gravel voice for Siu's sotelle
The Joensuu City Council's view of the Siun sote project is apparently unanimous, but one of the gravel voices is also present.
At the Board of Directors' meeting on Monday, Mr Pentti Keskisalo (sd., in the picture) presented a departure from the project, but his presentation was unsound.
The Board approved the draft decision by Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be revised at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will deliver the final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train from Eagle to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger train traffic from Kotka to Kouvola will remain in the future, albeit fewer than one train crew.
There will be changes in passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One pair of trains is left out, but still five times a day you can get from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The contractions are due to state austerity measures.
The purchase money of the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four-year period will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quieter routes will be completely stopped.
VR will establish new timetables by the end of the year.
They will enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed up to the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys got out.
The rescue department let a 12-year-old who climbed the roof out of a jam, who couldn't get off the roof on his own.
The situation arose in Tornionmäki, Ketotie, around 5:30 on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladder to the roof.
It did not prevent a group of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mast of radio amateurs next to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same way, but one didn't.
As a result, the others fled the scene and passersby called on the rescue service to help the last one safely left on the roof with a betlift back to the surface.
FedEx's turnover variation, weaker outlook for the financial year 2016
FedEx announced its weak performance in the last quarter. The transport industry's performance forecast for the whole year weakened due to reduced demand for freight services and increased costs of land transport.
The company plans to hire 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that it would employ 50 000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
The company's share decreased by about 2.5 per cent 45 minutes before the opening of its actual trading on Wednesday.
FedEx's forecast is between $10.40 and $10.90 for the financial year ending in May, with a decrease of 20 cents compared to the previous forecast.
According to a FactSet study, analysts predicted $10.84.
The forecast has weakened in spite of an average price increase of 4.9%, which will take effect on 4 January. Additional charges for land transport of heavy or large-scale consignments will take effect in November.
The company still expects profit growth from the previous year due to cost cuts, higher turnover and growth in online sales.
The president and CEO Fred Smith noted that the company has performed well in a weaker economic situation than expected, which has particularly affected production and global trade.
A day after the competitor UPS announced its plans to employ approximately the same number of seasonal workers as last year, i.e. between 90 000 and 95 000 people, was announced.
In the quarter ending 31 August, FedEx's operating profit was $692 million, which means an increase of 6%.
The profit per share was $2.42 and the forecast of $2.44 was therefore left behind for the 12 analysts at Zacks Investment Research.
Net sales rose by five per cent to $12.3 billion.
According to six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, the turnover was expected to be EUR 12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been hit by a reduction in the number of international first-class shipments, which has caused the company's Express unit to fail.
The strong growth in e-commerce has strengthened FedEx Ground's performance.
In the last quarter, the turnover of land transport grew by 29 per cent, but the operating profit showed the increased costs of large-scale deliveries and insurance.
The Express Unit produced better thanks to higher basic charges, while the freight business's return decreased due to higher labour costs.
About an hour before the actual trading opening, FedEx's share price had fallen by $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
On Tuesday, the share fell by 11 per cent from the average of the year and by 17 per cent below the highest quotation recorded on 11 June.
This week, the decision-makers of the Federal Reserve, Fed, will meet for the most anticipated meeting in years, sitting at a wooden table in Honduras of eight metres in diameter to decide whether it is time to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
On the wall of the central bank's decorative two - story conference room is a wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, and his colleagues, must put the financial interests of the State above those of everyone else.
The Central Bank has a double order from Congress: maximise employment in the United States and keep prices stable here.
After the Great Depression, however, the central bank's management has taken note of the third unwritten mandate: financial stability.
On Thursday, the Central Bank is due to announce whether the US economy is ready to start weaning on the unexpected stimulus offered by short-term interest rates that remained close to zero at the end of 2008.
Although the majority of data show a steady economic growth, the recent financial turmoil may already scare the prudent central bank's officials into increasing volatility by increasing the federal tax reference rate – even by one quarter.
"The labour market and inflation are, of course, the first and most important in their practical monitoring," says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the banker's shop Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if the Central Bank is looking for an excuse not to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty of the global market is enough to keep us waiting," Piegza continues.
Those who have considered this matter do not agree with what the Central Bank intends to do, which in itself causes nervousness.
About half of the economists in the Bloomberg study saw an increase in interest rates this week.
However, in the financial markets, the central bank is expected to wait and the main indicator is that there is only a 30% chance of raising.
If the central bank raises its key interest rate, the stock prices may decrease unless the decision-makers soften the blow by promising a second withdrawal.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average index jumped to 228.89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16 599.85.
"The reason for the glimpse was the expectation that the central bank would keep the steering rate stable this week," said John Lonski, Chief Economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the central bank were to raise interest at this stage," he said.
"If this were to happen, the Central Bank would have to consider carefully how to keep the hands of those operating in the financial markets unshakable."
In turn, one expert stated that raising interest rates would help to calm the financial markets and remove uncertainty as to when the central bank would operate.
Just a month ago, the Central Bank seemed to be inclined to raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, which would be the first small step towards tightening up the financial conditions and thereby strengthening the recovery of the United States.
Yellen has said throughout spring and early summer that he expected interest rates to be raised this year – despite the fact that the liberals say economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, at its lowest level now for seven years and close to the level that the Central Bank is reducing to full employment.
Wages seem to pick up.
Although inflation continued to fall below the central bank's annual targets of 2%, the central bank's decision-makers noted that the main reason for this was the sharp temporary effect of oil prices.
"The economy can cope with higher interest rates and needs them, as long as they take account of the tight situation on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However , the financial markets around the world did not startle last month when China devalued its currency .
Dow Jones industrial average dropped by up to 16 percentage points from the record height of May and investors feared that the decline in the Chinese economy would also affect global growth.
The market has picked up this month, and Dow Jones has now fallen by almost 10% since the peak of May.
The turmoil in the market means that the decision-makers of the central bank will become even more complicated to reflect on the increase in the steering rate.
"The Central Bank's work is complicated despite what happened in the financial markets and what news of the deterioration of the Chinese economy has been coming in recent weeks," said Stephen D. Oliner, senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former central bank official.
He now believes that the Central Bank will wait at least a month to deal with the effects.
"There is a great deal of uncertainty as to what will be the impact on the US economy. There is little reliable information about the situation since the recent development of the Chinese economy," said Oliner.
The reorganisation of the world economy is not the central bank's main concern, so in principle it should not affect the decision-making of the central bank.
In practice, however, the Central Bank is the most powerful player in the world's monetary economy.
The impact of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
In 2013, nothing more than an insinuation from the then President Ben S. Bernanken that the central bank could reduce the scale of its operations caused upheavals around the world.
In today's world, markets and economies are closely intertwined; in addition to monitoring world developments, the central bank is also required to communicate with other central banks and experts in order to have a good overview of the global economy.
"The Central Bank's decision-making process is more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, Director of Envestnet Inc's Global Strategy.
The President of the Regional Central Bank of Jeffrey Lecker Richmond said this month that the Central Bank has previously overreacted to financial market movements that seem to be unrelated to the fundamental economic pillars.
Mr Lecker, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, has called for an increase in the steering rate, as an example of the decisions taken in 1998 and 1999.
"The economic crisis in Asia led to the Central Bank's decision at three meetings to reduce the key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points, even though only limited identifiable sanctions were available for US economic growth," Mr Lecker explained.
A year later, the Central Bank annulled the decision.
"The Central Bank should give priority to monetary stability only in a major crisis, such as the collapse of the 2008 economy," said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England's interest rate committee.
The latest turmoil is not even approaching the situation at the time," he said.
"There is absolutely no reason to be afraid of raising interest due to the shock of the market," Peterson Institute for International Economics added.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention monetary stability, and until this changes, I do not think we should get ahead of ourselves."

Brazil's Rio Grande Pediatric Association promotes a proper diet for breastfeeding
Brazil's Rio Grande Pediatric Association SPRS has developed a sugary way of teaching breastfeeding women the meaning of a proper diet. They are presented with pictures of babies who are breastfed from the breast, painted with images of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, thus giving the baby everything it needs to feed and developing a strong immune system.
As a result of the additional energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 kilocalories.
According to a new study, additional changes in diet should be made in addition to increasing calorie levels.
A recent study by Texas' Baylor College of Medicine Professor Robert Waterland revealed that a pregnant woman's healthy diet can affect the baby's genes and protect the baby from tumor development.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the child's immune system.
Seven's Sunris has the most viewers, even though Nine is trying to get the lead on his Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson would go to Canberra to do a morning programme on the aftermath of the Liberal Party leadership elections, but that did little to improve today's ratings.
The Nine Channel morning program was sent from the capital, after Malcolm Turnbull replaced Tony Abbott.
David Koch and Samantha Armytage, on the other hand, sent the morning program of the competing channel from London. Special weekly broadcasts are also broadcast from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
It seems that the distance did not matter to Australian television viewers, since Sunrise was on average 397 000 viewers in five state capitals, while Today was 339 000 viewers.
Today's ratings rose slightly compared to last Monday (317 000) and Tuesday (283,000), but there was last Thursday's reading (343 000).
Today's been catching up with Sunrise for the past few months.
In August, Today had an average of 318,000 viewers, Sunris 330.000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40 000 and 50 000 viewers.
In September Sunrise has so far reached an average of 349 000 viewers and Today 314 000 viewers.
This is the most interesting event this morning.
The winds of change will have a greater impact on Parliament this morning.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!

Seven had a remarkable novelty with the 800 Words news series with the former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama is about a recently widowed father who decides to move to the New Zealand coast with his two children. The new series reached an amazing 1 219 000 spectators.
Critics have suspected that Thomson would be enough to be the star of the hit series alone without Rafters star Rebecca Gibson.
According to last night's ratings, the answer is clearly positive.
Seven's The X Factor maintained its strong position with 1,16,000 spectators. The series brightly defeated The Block (838 000) and TBL's Family series (726 000).
Seven's The Chase Australia has captured viewers in varying degrees.
An average of 446 000 viewers followed the first half of the new screening series hosted by Andrew O'Keefe (17.00-17.30).
In the second half hour (17.30-18.00), the audience rose to 623,000, which was more than Eddie McGuiren Hot Seat (613.000).
On Monday night, The Chase in Australia's first half had an average of 520,000 viewers, and the other half collected a staggering 720 000 spectators.
Hot Seat's audience was 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second night ratings showed Nine that Hot Seat will pass by at 5:30.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minnie, who was unable to challenge McGuire's series.

The final trio thinks Sam Wood really is the bachelor of dreams – but who does he choose?
Did the secret come out? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have inadvertently revealed the bachelor's choice.
The ultimate choice of bachelor Sam Wood has been a carefully preserved secret.
Three remaining women don't say a word about who got the last rose from the bachelor.
We were asking questions about Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows before one of the triads was dropped off.
Sam Wood's lips are tightly sealed until Thursday's finals.
All three women were thrilled that Wood was the perfect man. Women praised the man's sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive qualities and considered him a suitable partner for themselves.
When women were asked who would be the most suitable companion for Wood if the last rose did not hit its own spot, their answers may give an indication of who would take the bachelor's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay after themselves as the most suitable partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have everything worked out easily since the beginning.
"As soon as I got to the house, I noticed that Sarah and Sam fit well together. This feeling has been preserved throughout the program," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah has legs on the ground, and he's really fun to have," Markoski added.
"I've seen them together, and I have to admit there's chemistry between them.
They seem like a natural couple.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood are a good couple.
Mackay told me that he realized last week on a hometown date that Wood could be the one.
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this wasn't just a race. I'm now investing in our relationship," Mackay said.
When Mackay was asked who Wood should choose if he didn't choose him, she answered mysteriously:
"I can't say," he said.
"I like other girls as much as you do. Snezana and Lana are equal."
The bachelor of dreams on Ten on Wednesday at 7.30 p.m.

Jarryd Hayne has several options for starting an NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hayne since she moved to the United States. Several other clubs also took an interest in the man after an impressive day of open practice last year.
Hayne picked out the San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsula, and it looks like it hit him.
Some coaches would have kept Hayne on the bench, as the man did with the Australian rugby national team. Hayne messed up the flight kickback after the team took the victory on Tuesday from Minnesota at 20–3.
Tomsula, however, showed confidence in Hayne and gave the man another chance to return the flight kick, and the coach held Hayne's game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula continued her line in the locker room after the game.
He wasn't sprinkling newbies in front of the rest of the team. He was encouraging them.
Tomsula also defended Hayne publicly at a press conference after the game.
The 49ers specialist Cam Inman reported that Hayne also received encouragement from special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget the failed capture and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne is going to fuck up the capture, the first quarter of the game against Minnesota Vikings.
Hayne and her Australian fan gang had been waiting for something else from the guy's NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after the failure and later told Hamish and Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start for his NFL career.
"These things happen and we have to move on," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the error to his debut in the State of Origin series in 2007, when his pitch in his own area opened a place for Queensland.
But overall, the experience was incredible for a 27-year-old young man.
Hayne published an Instagram photo of her posing with fans and the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at gunpoint at the airport in Siberia.
Mr Khodorkovsky, who was openly challenged by President Putin, was convicted, Mr Jukos, a man-owned oil company, was discharged and his work in favour of democracy was restricted.
Four dead police officers fired rubber bullets at protestors in Nepal.
Four people died in southern Nepal, a source of government reported on Wednesday, and the police fired rubber bullets at a mob in a protest against the alleged new constitution of the country, including a four-year-old boy.
The violence occurred on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh region, less than three hundred kilometers from Kathandus capital.
According to district manager Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, more than 1 000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, some of whom threw stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal told me that the police used tear gas and fired into the air before they fired rubber bullets.
According to him, 20 police officers and five civilians were wounded.
It is not entirely clear why rubber bullets, which may kill but are generally regarded as a less destructive option, were suddenly so deadly.
This was the most recent confrontation in weeks of protest in the southern plains of Nepal, where, according to the Madhesi tribe, new provinces based on the new constitution would undermine their political influence.
Protests have also been seen in Western Nepal, where the Tharus tribe demands its own state.
At least 40 people, 11 of whom are police officers, have died in violent conflict since 10 August,
This is an important step towards a new constitution, but the subject is very sensitive in Nepal, where the administration has been centralised for centuries.
The new constitution has been working on since 2008, but the process has been accelerated by legislators since thousands of people died in the tragic earthquake of April.
The legislators have voted on constitutional clauses in Kathmandu this week, and the authorities say that the new Charter could be adopted by Sunday.
NHC Hurricane Centre: 60 % probability for cyclone south of Cape Verde
From a large area of low pressure, about 560 km from the southernmost parts of Cape Verde, 60% of the chances of developing a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, reported the National Hurricane Center of the United States on Tuesday.
According to the Miami Meteorological Institute, there is also a clear low pressure center between Cape Verde and Little Antilles, which can also be 60% likely to develop into a tropical cyclone within the next two days.
Google plans to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GooGL.O) announced the launch of a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian aid organisations that help thousands of people fleeing war and poverty across Europe.
Google announced a donation campaign on its blog in a particularly personal way.
Instead of management, the campaign was launched by Google employee Rita Masoud by telling about her own experiences. She was only seven years old when she fled Kabul with her family.
"We traveled in the dark by train and bus and experienced hunger, thirst, cold and fear," Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
As the European refugee and migration crisis worsened, many families in similar situations are desperately in need of help.
Donations are addressed to non-profit organisations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors without frontiers, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children's Association and the UN Refugee Organisation.
When donations have been collected through google.com/refugeerelief $5.5 million, Google promises to donate an equivalent amount, reaching 11 million in total.
The European refugee crisis is at its worst since World War II, and this situation is compounded particularly by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has forced more than four million people this year to flee their homes.
The war will also have to be fled from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Mildly overweight diabetic patients may benefit from obesity surgery
According to a new study, mildly overweight type 2 diabetic patients may benefit from obesity surgery for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether mildly overweight type 2 diabetics will live longer after a fat surgery than those receiving non-operative treatment.
"It takes time to get the data on death," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, expert on obesity surgery, who was working on a new study in JAMA Surgery.
By means of fat surgery, or bariatric surgery, the stomach is reduced by different methods.
Surgical methods reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food in the body.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective treatments for type 2 diabetes, but most of the studies have included people with a pathologically overweight body mass index (BMI) of at least 35.
Body mass index indicates weight and height with a normal value of 18,5-24,9.
When the body mass index is over 25, the person is overweight, and the body mass index of over 30 shows significant obesity.
You can calculate your own body mass index at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In a new study, researchers at Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 in a study comparing two methods of obesity surgery, gastric bypass surgery and sleeve surgery, to the treatment of mildly obese subjects with type 2 diabetes.
After obesity surgery, the mean body mass index decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of study.
The body mass index of non-operative patients was maintained near 29.
In all, 36% and 28% of those treated with surgery were cured.
In the treatment group, the overall improvement in diabetes was only 1% and in part only about 2%.
The study also showed that blood pressure, triglycerides and bad LDL cholesterol were better in the surgical group.
Researchers also monitored patients with haemoglobin-A1c levels, which reflect the development of blood glucose levels.
According to investigators, the recommended haemoglobin-A1c level is less than 7%.
Following surgery, haemoglobin-A1c decreased from 9% to 6% on average.
In the treatment group, the value remained unchanged at around 8%.
The hemoglobin A1c level indicates control of blood glucose levels. However, a study group led by Dr Chih-Cheng Hsu concluded that this did not reduce mortality over five years.
The study team also compared the consequences of two different methods of surgery.
During the fifth year in the gastric bypass surgery group, weight loss was higher than in the sleeve surgery group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), the body mass index decreased higher (7.4 and 5.1), as well as the haemoglobin-A1c levels (3.1% and 2.1 %). In the bypass surgery group, diabetes was also completely improved by a higher proportion (46.9 and 16.7%).
The new study was unable to show a lower mortality rate after five years. However, according to a Swedish study by the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Phoenix, the surgery will bring years of life to fat people.
In a Swedish study, fat people undergoing gastric bypass surgery had a 29% reduction in the probability of mortality over 15 years compared to the conventional treatment group.
Although no lower mortality was observed in the new study, Blackstone claimed that it was confirmed that individuals with a BMI below 35 could benefit from the measure.
"This is the most important finding in the study because it says that surgery is safe in the lower body mass index group and does not increase the risk of death or kidney disease," Blackstone wrote.
According to Blackstone, people and doctors should take weight seriously when the body mass index is 27-30.
"We wait too long for people to take the situation seriously," said the researcher.
"When genetic changes have accumulated in the human body that predispose to obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation."
"Not everyone can come to Europe" Dalai Lama – RT News
Europe is not in a position to receive all refugees, as the Dalai Lama has said, and he says that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibet's Buddhism has called for the end of violence in refugees' countries of origin.
Dalai Lama addressed the refugee crisis during her visit to the United Kingdom. Dalai Lama gave her speech at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion Centre in Oxford, which focuses on ethical research.
According to the Dalai Lama, in the current situation, humanity must take precedence over individual countries or continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is not enough in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," said Dalai Lama in her speech.
Although Mr Dalai Lama thanked Germany and Austria for their efforts in the event of a crisis, he stressed that the solution was only temporary.
"While caring for thousands of refugees is a wonderful act, there are also long-term solutions to be considered and how we can bring about genuine peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education," Dalai Lama stressed.
"In the end, we need to consider how we can reduce the number of killings in these countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
Force has never solved problems," he added.
In his speech on violence, Mr Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions in connection with the terrorist attacks of 11 September and claimed that, when he resorted to force in response to the terrorist attack, the United States created an uncontrolled chain of events.
"After the attacks on September 11, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution would come through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he resorted to force with unpredictable consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Ingestion of handicrafts quadrupled in children in four years
According to Georgia's Toxicity Centre, poison centres across the United States reported an almost fourfold increase in alcohol-intensive handicraft ingestion in children under 12 years of age since 2010.
According to Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Centre, the cases of hand swallowing reported to poison centres in children under 12 years of age increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"These products are increasingly accessible to children and, unfortunately, some of them go to emergency care," Lopez told CNN.
According to Lopez, children drink scripts on purpose, some to impress their friends and some to encourage social media.
YouTube videos show teenagers drinking disinfectants because of cheap drunkness.
Teenagers are reported to mix alcohol - rich oral water with disinfectant to make the drink stronger.
Smaller children can be attracted to the scent of hand dishs.
"The child doesn't think the substance is bad," Lopez said.
"Most of the attractive handicraft products are just perfumed.
There are strawberry, grape and orange-flavoured handicraft products that appeal to children."
The alcohol content of the disinfectants is between 45 % and 95 %.
A small number of young children can cause alcohol poisoning.
"The alcoholic strength of the hand is very high," Stephen Thornton, medical director at the University Hospital in Kansas, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
"No one would leave a whiskey shot within the reach of children, but if hand disinfection products are often left within the reach of children, they quickly produce a large amount of alcohol."
The six - year - old Nhaijah Russell recently enjoyed four sloping strawberry scents of hand sanitizers at school, and the girl was delivered to the emergency room for treatment.
"The girl's blood alcohol level was 179, which is twice as high as the adult drunk limit," says Chris Ritchey, a doctor at the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Nhaijah sopered and couldn't walk when he was brought to the emergency room.
Doctors followed her overnight in a separate children's hospital in case of brain damage, as she had fallen and hit her head after drinking alcohol," Ritchey explained.
"The situation was really scary," said Nhaijah's mother Ortoria Scott to CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products and alcohol swabs in addition to transferring your hands away from children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing handhelds containing a toxic substance that had not been reported.
Health authorities considered that the product contained lethal methanol instead of ethyl alcohol, although the latter is indicated as an active substance in the product fiche.
According to a police report, three fourth grade students in the north of New York City were planning in January to kill a "bad" teacher by placing antibacterial products around the classroom.
The teacher is very allergic to handicrafts and refused to bring it into the classroom.
The police considered that the plan that went into the dump was meaningless and urged the school to take disciplinary action.
Rumour mill: no discord in Celtic's ranks
Griffith is underestimating Celtic discord, while Delia admits that the team isn't all right, but she thinks she can get it right.
The Hearts button against SFA for Neilson's punishment, and Warburton will watch out for January's player transfers so that team unity does not suffer.
Aberdeen's neck to Celtic five points
The first half of ADAM Rooney's punishment brought Aberdeen a limited victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium, which raised Aberdeen's five-point run-off from Celtic.
Griffiths is underestimating what he says about discord.
Griffiths has ignored the rumours of discord in Celtic's ranks, and according to his own words, Griffiths and his team are not under surveillance as they prepare to face the Dutch serial leader.
"I don't think we're under any pressure.
The Dutch miss an old Scottish couple – de Boer
The former Rangers midfield player and the Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer have noted that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because they are no longer allowed to follow Celtic and Rangers double-crossing.
De Boer, who works for Ajax's team leader, said: "There are no more highlights of Celtic games in Holland. Why?
Because the Rangers are no longer involved."
"We don't just talk about the Rangers coming back here.
They're talking about Old Firm here.
The Dutch are looking for a team-to-team struggle.
Old Firm's games have enormous tension and are also of interest beyond Scotland's borders."
I'll turn it around, Delia assures me.
Ronny Delia admits that Celtic is having a hard time, but the Norwegian pilot assures us that the situation will change.
The club that lost to Malmö fell out of the Champions League and lost ten players to Aberdeen, who now has a five-point lead at the top of the table.
"Celtic has had difficult episodes before, and we will rise again," said Delia.
"We want to improve our situation as quickly as possible.
The situation is very frustrating, and it is a source of hatred or sadness in many people.
So do we, but we have to move on.
We urgently need the support of Celtic supporters, which will considerably strengthen players.
The spirit of cooperation is now very important."
Warburto's careful about the January player transfers.
Although it was only a few weeks ago that Rangers boss Mark Warburton hinted about January's transfer targets, he is cautious about the transfer reels and says that he wants to compromise team unity.
"The players' transfers in January differ significantly from the summer's transfers," said Brentford's ex-coacher.
"The players joining the team in the summer will be able to get used to the team before the start of the season, which has been successful in our lineup this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes unnecessary gambling acquisitions can cause the team more harm than benefits."
Michu, who's thinking about retirement in Celtic's sights.
Swansea's attacker Michu has been linked to Celtic in player transfer talks, while Michu has hinted at retirement after the Swans contract ended.
The trouble with 29-year-old Michu has for years been an abhorrent ankle, and he was unable to get a transfer from Wales in the summer.
Hearts ready for SFA match on Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field. The team finally lost 3-2. The defenseman's red card was cancelled later. It's already the third Collum red card within eight months, which will be revoked.
But Neilson stands by his words. "I didn't question honesty. I didn't comment on performance.
Griffiths swears he'll avoid Tynecastle.
Griffiths was being rebuked for admitting that he had slanderous songs about the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Edinburgh Roseburn region prior to the Edinburgh local match in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"There was a local match, and the atmosphere was intense," said the attacker. "I can guarantee that I won't go back to Tynecastle except for Celtic."
Tannadice's management team believes in Dundee United's coaching management – Donnelly
Simon Donnelly assures us that Dundee United's management team can make things better, and no more extradition in the field can be allowed.
"Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready to fight," Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy with Hamilton's win with dirty game
Derek McInnes admits that Aberdeen was desperately forced to stand up to Hamilton for his seventh consecutive league victory, and with victory, Aberdeen took a five-point neck to Celtic at the top of a serial board, which is thanks to Adam Rooney's punishment in the first half of the line.
"There is no Cup or League Winner team that would not have won such games," McInnes said.
Unemployment unchanged in Scotland, growing in the British Isles
The number of unemployed remained unchanged in Scotland between May and July, with 164 000 unemployed and 10 000 unemployed in the UK as a whole.
According to the Office for National Statistics, the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9%, compared with 5.5% in the UK as a whole.
There are 12 000 fewer people in work in Scotland than three months earlier and now there are 2 612 000 in work.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0% in the quarter and the average employment rate in the United Kingdom as a whole is 73.5%.
Mr David Mundell, Scottish Minister for Affairs, commented on recent figures: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for a strong economy."
Almost exactly one year ago, Scotland made an historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom.
The labour market situation in Scotland has improved over the past year: unemployment has decreased.
Why am I following an execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, if there is no legal basis for withdrawal, I will follow the execution.
If the execution is carried out, which I do not wish for, I will be sitting in the execution room of the state prison in Oklahoma when Richard Glossip is executed with a poison injection.
Glossip has asked me to be one of four official witnesses.
I received an invitation in January through a man's best friend, and despite my shock, I replied yes.
As the day draws near, I am terrified.
Then why did I say yes?
I said yes because I thought I could tell you a true story about the death penalty.
The point of view would be unique.
Journalists will be able to monitor executions in the United States, and since there are more applications than seats, participants will be selected with a macabre value.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of journalists from 12 to 5.
The chosen will follow the execution in moderation.
I can't do it.
I'm sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've created a personal relationship with a man, because we've talked on the phone several times over the months, and one of my visits lasted two and a half hours.
I like this man.
We laugh often when we talk.
According to the prison staff, I cannot be present as both a witness and a journalist, so I am not allowed to carry a notebook and a pen to take notes.
All I have to do is try to put the details in my mind.
I was accused on Twitter by an oklahic journalist of endangering neutrality.
"The basic idea is this:
When you tell a doomed story in a way that pleases him, you'll get close to him."
I expressed my disagreement with the reporter.
The reporter woman admitted that she could have formulated her words more carefully, but still found my actions wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I've said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he tried to tell me what to do, I wouldn't do it.
I've told him he can remove me from the witness list at any time.
However, he wants an international journalist who can write about what happened.
If Glossip dies, he'll believe that publicity will promote a movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware from Huffington Post will be sitting next to me.
If you want more information on the subject, you can listen to my podcast.
I am not going to repeat the details in this context.
I can't tell you that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Tree's murder would turn him into an accessory after the crime.
However, I believe that it is very likely that Mr Glossip has not committed murder.
I absolutely believe that there was insufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
I believe his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I will follow his execution.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
An objective description can be read from other journalists' cases.
I'll tell you what it's like to watch a man die in vain.
He was lured from the Canning River after a watery police hunt.
The officer in the Canning Vale area remained dry when he lured the man up from the Canning River.
The Perthian man's escape attempt stopped in shallow, muddy water, and the police who were a few yards away managed to get the man back to the dry land.
Canning Vale Police received a call on Tuesday for an unauthorized stay in Beckenham.
When the police arrived, they discovered a suspect who was trying to shake off the police by heading for the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"The man standing in the water said he wouldn't come out of the water and told the police to get him in the water," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavecia was not tempted to water his uniform, so he chose a safer tactic — negotiation.
"Sometimes an attempt to escape makes a person resort to amusing means," said Sergeant Castledine.
The case of football champion Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid a police blast and tried to swim across the Swan River.
The man's attempt was doomed, but the stunt inspired the locals to design the Ben Cousins biathlon.
According to Peter Moody, the trustees tried to spy on him, and he's threatening to stop competing.
Peter Moody accuses the agents of Racing Victoria of attempting to spy on their stables last year, and he threatened to stop competing immediately.
Moody claims that he has been personally attacked by the trustees and Racing Victoria's integrity department, and the rejection of Lady Tatai due to the recent treatment given on the day of the race was the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to work for racing. Moody has been in a difficult situation when Lidar's sample found cobalt and the man couldn't explain the discovery.
Moody's been keeping his tongue in check for a year and a half on espionage charges, and he didn't want the accusations to seem like a bitter man.
"I wasn't going to bring it up. I thought about this for a long time, but sometimes frustration breaks out once and for all," Moody said.
"They know what really happened."
"Sometimes I have to react and accept the consequences. I now have to accept the status after I opened my mouth.
I go home and sleep well at night.
I want the owners of the horses to think I'm doing the best I can.
If the owners don't believe in it, I don't think I should continue as a horse coach anymore.
I'd have to think about my future as a licensed coach."
Moody dropped the bomb earlier in an interview with Racing.com, where he told me about the integrity department's espionage efforts at his stable.
"A year and a half ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered a job to a man in my stable to spy on my actions. I'll tell the man's name on request," Moody said to Racing.com.
"They clearly believe I'm a fraud.
If so, they should present the evidence, for I have not been caught for anything illegal.
Robert Roulston, former president of the RVL, David Moody, current president of the RVL, and Bernard Sundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of the activities then and now.
Should I view the situation as a personal pursuit?
Should the RVL take real action and place responsibility for the situation in the sector on non-trainers?
Am I bad for the business?
Am I really bad for the industry?
Maybe that's what a lot of people think.
Maybe I'll get a training license and push me away from my duties, and there's no doubt that I'm gonna make a lot of people think that with what I'm saying.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore.
It's really sad.
I'm putting pressure on them to make their decision.
My family supports me, and I can withdraw."
The long-standing study of Lidar's cobalt values and the recent rejection caused the coach to become frustrated in the end, threatening to give up his license.
Moody is best known as the coach of the unbeatable champion Black Caviar, who described the day-of-the-race rule as ridiculous after the horse's feet had been placed in an irregular clay wrap.
"The treatment is against the rules.
I take full responsibility for it," Moody said.
"A member of my staff mistakenly put clay on a horse's foot.
The clay treatment could have been done last night.
It could have been done yesterday afternoon, and it did.
But it happened on the day of the race."
Moody can be expected to be subject to a three-month ban on irregular clay treatment, which the organisers have begun to investigate.
"This is a joke.
The rules are made by someone who knows no horses at all.
Everyone understands that there is a need for rules, but this has gone too far," said Moody.
Arrested who escaped Cobram's crash site
The police have arrested a cyclist this weekend, a man who escaped the scene of an accident.
The cyclist was taken by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital and suffered serious injuries after a car hit him on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
According to the police, the man driving the car fled the scene and did not stay to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported to the Shepparton police.
The man is likely to be charged with failure to comply with his obligations to stop and assist in a traffic accident and other traffic offences.
A 40-year-old cyclist from Cobram is still in hospital and is stable.
Melbourne Storm's coach Craig Bellamy points in the face to the wrestling speeches of opponents.
Melbourne Storm's coach Craig Bellamy considers the criticism of his team's tackle game to be a purpose-oriented action by the NRL's two league favorites.
According to Sydney Roosters' coach Trent Robinson, the judges allowed Storm to wrestle in Sydney on Friday night at a qualifying match won by Melbourne's hosts to annoy them.
The coach of Brisbane Broncos, Wayne Bennett, barely covered up the reference to Storm after Broncos won the qualifying final on Saturday night at Queensland Cowboys.
Bellamy defended his own team's tackle and said they were focused on contact when they tackled.
Bellamy added that his confidence in his team was enhanced by the fact that his team was criticised by two top team coaches. Bellamy sees this as an indication that coaches are worried about losing to Storm.
"This thing always comes up. As I recall, Trent Robinson didn't say anything about wrestling when his team beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I guarantee we haven't changed anything in our defense system or in our techniques all year long. For the past six weeks, we've just been investing in contact games and tackles, which has turned us into a rise.
Trent's been on his mission for three years, and he may have been shocked to lose because he's got a great team that's not used to losing.
It's funny that the same thing always comes up at the same time of the year.
Bellamy did not agree with Bennett about what is interesting football. She reminded her mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the League in 2010 by playing boring football.
"Wayne talks about interesting football.
He compared his team's game from Saturday to our Friday game and found their game interesting," Bellamy said.
"In 2010, St. Georgea received a lot of criticism for his boring game. Wayne said that he would not get a drop of criticism.
Now he has a team that can play so-called football, especially his young, fast backseaters.
That's the kind of football you want to play when the player arsenal is like this.
He highlighted this in 2010. Now he wants everyone to play with his style. Not all teams have central attackers like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
This gives me more confidence when other coaches are so worried about meeting my team that they're going to resort to something like this.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think they'd meet us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that the game between Storm and Roosters scored more goals than the encounter between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game. I haven't seen it, but what was the outcome? 16-12?
The result of our game was 20-18. There were more situations in our game, but is it interesting football?
Or are gambling breaks and low scores an interesting football game?
I think the goals make it interesting.
If they mention us, we will probably meet them."
Storm has a free weekend because the team will be invited to visit either North Queensland Cowboys at Cronulla Sharks on Saturday at AAMI Park. Tickets will be available on Tuesday morning.
Serbian man released on $200,000 bail in a drug case.
For 40 kilos of cocaine smuggled into Queensland, a man waiting for a possible life sentence has been released on bail of $200,000.
Marko Maximovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after the police found 100 kilos of cocaine on the Solay ship that had come through Vanuatu from South America and arrived at Coomera port in August.
The police observed the meeting of Maximovic and his accomplice at the marina during the morning and later surprised the two at the Coomera Roadhouse café. A 40-pound shipment of drugs was found in the Toyota Echo car at the parking lot.
Although Maximovic is potentially looking for life in prison for possession of a drug for commercial purposes, there is no evidence that his lawyer tried to get the whole batch, but the man could have been in a café for an innocent purpose.
According to Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan, there is a risk that Maximovic is trying to escape the country.
"Maximovic clearly has connections with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia frequently", the judge said in court on Wednesday.
"He lied to the police about where he lived."
Maximovic's mother and stepfather together paid 200,000 bail against which he was released.
"After reading the oaths of both parties, it is clear that $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
"However, it alone is not enough to prevent a man's escape," the judge warned.
Maximovic was released on condition that he surrenders both his Australian and Serbian passports, reports to the police daily and stays home from six o'clock in the morning.
Stevan Hogg used her phone to get the pedophiles to send pictures.
A pedophile used a 11-year-old girl's phone to get control of pictures of children being abused.
Stevan Hogg took the phone while the girl was sleeping and logged into an online message service where he got another user to send himself inappropriate pictures of the children.
Later, when she woke up, she noticed that the phone was missing, and she was sleeping in Hogg's hand.
While she was browsing the contents of her phone, she found shocking messages and immediately told her mother.
The five photos were reported to the police. After studying the computers found at the address, the police found disturbing Internet searches using searchwords to search for inappropriate child pictures.
Hogg claimed to the police that he was trying to mislead pedophiles on the Internet and that he was pretending to be a police officer with the intention of scaring pedophiles.
D.A. Eilidh Robertson said in the local court at Dundee Sheriff Court: "The man claimed to be addicted to intimidation.
He admitted that he did the searches on a computer, but claimed that he did so to present the police and thus to intimidate the paedophiles.
Hogg was asked about conversations with an unknown person who had sent the pictures to him and from whom Hogg had asked for more pictures.
Hogg claimed that his purpose was to mislead the pedophiles.
He told me that he had some disturbing thoughts when he was drinking and that he wanted to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added: "After finding the messages from the phone, the girl cried out to her mother, shaking and crying."
The girl saw the inappropriate photos on the phone, and then Hogg was questioned.
The girl said the defendant used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger.
23-year-old Hogg Dundeen from Ward Road confessed to charges of possession of inappropriate child pictures on 14 June last year. Hogg violated his bail on 25 January this year and failed to appear in court for hearing on 24 March this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked not to put Hogg in the register of sexual offenders, as it can be considered that the crime did not contain significant sexual features.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence to October on account of background social work reports.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody on other grounds.
Hogg was added to the register of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment.
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe gives the wrong speech in Parliament
The oldest head of state in Africa, Mugabe, fell down the stairs leading to the podium earlier this year.
Mugabe was not injured, but the video of what happened quickly spread on social media.
The opening of this House was also overshadowed by the allegations made by the opposition party legislators that they have received anonymous death threats warning them against booing Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, MPs booed and interrupted the speech on the situation of the President's State in Parliament by mid-term applause, which the President gave on Tuesday.
The MDC bishop, Innocent Gonese (Movement for Democratic Change) said that seven opposition politicians received text messages calling for them not to interfere with Mugabe's speeches.
"The message has been sent from an unknown number, but the message is entitled "Death", Gonese told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
The message warns the recipients that outside this House they are no longer immune.
According to the party's whipper, the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is concerned about threats against politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard plans to reduce between 25 000 and 30 000 jobs as part of restructuring and saving operations in business services.
HP is divided into two listed companies later this year and separates the computer and printer business from the faster-growing business equipment and service activities.
According to HP's press release, the company will record one-off costs of $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter of the year.
"The new arrangements will allow a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise", said Meg Whitman, Managing Director of HP, who will run the company after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more focused company than the current HP, and we have a large and deep portfolio of business operations that will help companies to move into a new business style." Whitman said.
"As our own company, our position is better than ever and we are better able to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has an annual turnover of more than $50 billion and, according to its mission, the company focuses on delivering unique integrated technology solutions to companies.
Founded in the 1930s by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, raised by Stanford University, the company is now divided into two separate companies. The two companies set up an electronics company in a garage in Palo Alto, now considered the birthplace of Silicon Valley.
HP has undergone massive restructuring as traditional desktop computers are moving to mobile devices.
The second largest computer manufacturer in the world and HP, one of the largest technology companies in the United States, are the most recent transfer in a sector where concentration is believed to bring success.
Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta: The team must support the injured Jack Wilshere before meeting Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is only September. If everything goes well with a rehabilitation plan, there is no reason why he could not return to the airport already in December.
The best scenario is that Wilshere will certainly have to miss at least the next four national team games in England, and, knowing his history, his participation in the European Championships is clearly unclear.
The main trouble with the latest problem is that Wilshere decided last season strongly after the ankle injury and seemed to have returned to his former blade under the new season.
"This type of injury does not threaten a career," Wenger said.
"The bone didn't heal properly.
It's not a serious injury.
It was just an accident.
It had nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries."
Medically, this may be the case, but as Mr Wenger also said, there may be further injuries when the player tries to return to the field during the season.
There is also an unpleasant regularity here.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different types of effort since Wilshere debuted six years ago.
He also played in Arsenal's ranks in only 65 of the 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The larger picture of Arsenal is that since 2007-2008, six out of eight seasons the team has been one of the teams that lost most money due to injuries.
Wenger accepts a possible vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that the improved injury statistics last season continue to improve.
"Sometimes a return after injury may involve a vulnerable period when you need to strengthen your body and apply for competitive advantages," Wenger said.
"Jack's young, so he'll get through this.
I hope that he will balance his body, and I believe it, and with it his career will continue as he deserves."
Arsenal will start his Champions League job on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb. After that, the team will meet Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur the following Wednesday. Wenger is preparing small changes to the lineup.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also put Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott in the starting lineup.
"I try to take care of the balance of the team and give rest to those who need it," Wenger mentioned.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite for the F-Group, Maximir Zagreb is one of Europe's most frightening stadiums.
Dinamo has also been an undefeated 41-game team.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night when the earth shook at 3.2 on the Richter scale.
The earthquake was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned his lesson from last season after having had to yield to Monaco. He is also still motivated by the distant hope of piloting the team towards the European Championship.
"We have a huge energy charge," Wenger said.
"The Arsenal has not yet been hit by this title.
We were very close in 2006. On the other hand, with experience, I am also a realist.
We are ambitious, but not dreamers."
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us the truths about friendship between men
A similar description shines with its absence in other series. It is noteworthy, especially given that men's need to open up is greater than ever and young men's suicide statistics are at their highest in 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the main cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK. Suicide is three times more common among men than among women.
Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) tackles the problem by declaring 2015 as a year for men. The campaign aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking the help they need.
Friendship is the ultimate idea of the challenge.
In a recent study, 2 000 high school students were interviewed, and according to the study, people with depression symptoms have a better chance of healing if they are surrounded by enough healthy people.
In addition, the incidence of asymptomatic persons had a half-lived incidence of morbidity if they had close relatives who had no mental health problems.
However, friendships are the basis for all of this.
Modern communication is dominated by social media, and communication style is often more important than content. Fast response is often considered more important than meaningful contact.
With the digitalisation of life, the need seems strong, fun and successful doubled, even though isolation is a reality.
The external values, money, image and social status associated with superficial success are all taking into account internal values and our natural desire for personal growth and friendship. Our inner values appear to be deeper in our mental health.
A millionaire in the video game industry recently noted that money really cannot buy happiness.
The great thing about the Friends was that the show turned the focus on its head.
None of the characters in the series were defined by profession but by personality. This was reflected in friendships.
The show was humorously played by Joey and Chandler hugging or watching football with their TV chairs. Ross also often missed Rachel. It was clear that men were able to relate to this even though they did not refrain from feeling fully.
One volunteer explained this to me: "As I listen to depressed and suicidal people, it has become clear to me how much even the smallest reactions of friends can mean.
Men who contact us often cannot talk to their friends.
The traditional idea that men should do well is strong. A man is easily regarded as weak if he talks about his problems."
"Frends is one of the series that presents long-term survival mechanisms.
In the series, small moments of friendship between men were highlighted.
Through the phone, I can offer help from outside at a time of despair, but long-term support comes from close friends and family."
In honor of Comedy Central's FriendsFest, the set has been brought back to life. So if you participate this weekend, you should take your friends to Central Perk for coffee.
Or do something even better, smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks.
You never know how important a friendship can become.
Comedy Central broadcasts the entire Friends series – all 236 episodes – in honor of #FriendsFest
Di Maria's hit helped the PSG defeat Malmö.
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan after finishing a goal against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored in her Champions League debut and helped PSG hit the Swedish team on Tuesday.
Read the game report and estimate.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were under attack when Paris Saint-Germain began his work in the Champions League by beating Malmö at Parc des Princes Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored the goal after less than four minutes of debut play. She strengthened the position of French champions right after the shakedown. However, PSG screwed up several goals before finally being able to increase their lead: Cavani painted the game after 60 minutes of play.
The A-block also includes Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish champion. PSG is not only looking for an extension in the playoffs, but also wants to improve its position for the quarterfinals in the three remaining matches.
Although SPG scored, the match was not a perfect act for Laurent Blanc's pilot team. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost his goal position and the man was replaced by his former home club, where he started his amazing career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or at guests in the Champions League, so the 2-0 win and good grips give us a good basis, even though we still have something to improve for the season," Blanc said.
"This is good news.
We were thirsty for victory and we were able to do it, but I'm sorry we couldn't do one or two more goals."
Ibrahimovic returned to the team after he was injured. On the weekend, the team had to settle for a 2-2 tie against Bordeaux in the Ligue 1 series. However, Di Maria overshadowed Ibrahimovic at four minutes.
Last month, the Argentine pier, which moved from Manchester United to the PSG ranks, was named the PSG's solver, which will raise the team to a new level in Europe. He proved himself worthy of being appointed as he raced the ball from Marco Verratt's pitch past Malmö's defense and then fired an accurate shot at the rear corner of the goal past Johan Wiland.
However, those who looked forward to the PSG's crushing victory were disappointed.
Malmö defeated Celtic in the playoffs, marched nine international players into the field from the start. The team playing with the tactics of five men's defenses and two attackers was difficult to win.
Nikola Djurdjic's shot was barely missed by Kevin Trapp's goal post in the game at 34 minutes. The team did not attack very actively.
On the other hand, PSG fell into vain feeding and weak finishing, not least Ibrahimovic, who lost five goals in the first half alone. At the beginning of the second half, Ibrahimovic's kick fed the goal to the backs of Cavani.
However, Ibrahimovic showed his claws in the feed game, and at Ibrahimovic's pitch, Di Maria fired a spiral kick past Wiland at 52 minutes.
The second goal came from the Count's time, thanks to Cavan. The six-way-playing Uurguayman shot a full hit when Ibrahimovic fed him a left winger for Maxwell's kick.
Malmö's goal ended in another goal, and only the Wiland's top-notch fight at close range from David Luiz kept the readings down, and Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal from the bench was abandoned at the very end of the line.
Malmö's pilot Åge Hareide later admitted that PSG was in its own class. "We played the previous Champions League game in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, where the level is not the same.
I don't think we'll be able to narrow it down.
A hallucinogenic for the Parisians.
This was their top game."
Glencore collects $2.5 billion with a share issue.
The Swiss mine giant Glencore, which was hit by the prices of raw materials, raised USD 2.5 billion in Wednesday's share issue as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, stated in his statement that he had sold new shares worth approximately GBP 1.6 billion in order to reduce debts.

Matt Damon is underestimating diversity in filmmaking.
Matt Damon had a heated conversation with African-American Effie Brown and found that diversity is not needed behind the camera.
In the HBO Project Greenlight series on Sunday night, an experienced actor interrupted Brown when he explained how important it is to take into account the different views on the project's chosen screenplay for the black main character.
"Monony is taken into account in film casting, not in program casting," Damon claimed.
Brown was shocked and injured by the claim. "Wow, that's clear," she said after Damon's comment that starred alone on Mars.
Damon and Brown were gathered with other producers, Ben Affleck and Farrelly brothers, to discuss the finalists of the race.
"Whoever is a director, I would like to encourage you to think about how Harmony's character is presented," Brown said at the outset.
"The only black character is a prostitute who has sex with her white pimp."
Dear White People producer supported Leo Angelo and Kristen Brancaccio as film directors. Damon harshly replied that the choice of two could lead to an undesirable outcome.
When the conversation was on TV, the social media exploded from Damon's displeasing comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger about the scene in plain terms: "The fact that Matt Damon talks to the only black person to explain what diversity is is so white that it hurts."
The tweet was distributed over 5,000 times and liked 4,000 times.
Damon's comments coincide with a time when the balanced representation of human races in the media is the number one subject.
After the death of a teenage Michael Brown from a white cop's bullet in 2014. Black Lives Matter received support across the country. The movement aims to stop discriminatory treatment of black-skinned people by lawmakers and authorities.
In February, singer Prince referred to the movement when presenting the album candidates of the year at the Grammy gala.
"Albums still matter," he said.
"Just like books and the lives of black people, albums still matter."
Recently, the Black Lives Matter published a statement in response to the question of Elisabeth Hasselbeck of Fowl News as to whether this group should be described as an hate group.
"Black Lives Matter network is a love-based group," said the management of the movement.
Damon is one of the entertainers, producers, and media moguls invited to the pope to discuss the Catholic Church's image in the West.
It is unknown whether Damon has responded positively to the call.
The first winner in the American Ninja Warrior series
Professional climber and vessel collector Isaac Caldiero took the first American Ninja Warrior title on Monday and signed off for $1 million of his winnings.
For the first time in the seventh period that had just ended the TV series, all the tasks assigned were clarified.
In the last episode of the season, Caldiero and photographer Geoff Britten survived the final round.
In the last assignment, men had to climb up a 23-metre rope in 30 seconds.
Britten cleared the mission in the first time given, and he was the first competitor to complete the fourth stage of the American Ninja Warrior race, but Caldiero did it three seconds faster and won.
Caldiero told E!News he was still in shock after he caught a million dollar pot.
"The winning amount is incredible because I have never made more than $10,000 a year," he said in an interview with E! about his winning jackpot.
"One minute, I can't even imagine what's going to happen, the future is open."
The lead producer Kent Weed talked to The Hollywood Reporter about the finals and why Britten was not rewarded, even though he was the first competitor to have worked out all the tasks.
"The regulations say the fastest wins the prize money.
If several competitors find out all the tasks, the fastest wins," Weed explained.
"The money prize is great and will revolutionize life, but Britten will also be satisfied with its performance.
I don't think he's gonna stay here and do anything else.
He's just happy with his performance.
He's had a lot of praise from the fans.
Britten's a great guy. Family's important to him.
His children and his wife think he's a hero.
Geoff told me that because he didn't win himself, he preferred to win for Isaac.
He also believes that Isaac would have felt the same way about him if the situation had been different."
America Ninja Warrior renewed into the eighth period, which will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers squeezed a victory over Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS -- Detroit Tigers has no particularly pleasant experience in the second half of the season.
Tigers, one of the best teams in baseball, is now in the last place of the American League Central.
But the team succeeded on Tuesday by hitting the Minnesota Twins on Target Field.
Twins lost his chance to get to Houston Astros to fight for the second wild card spot in the playoffs.
Detroit returned, even if only for one night, to a taste of victory, which has been behind a stone in the second half of the season.
"Every victory is nice, however it is achieved," said Tigers Pilot Brad Ausmus.
Tigers' pitcher Alfredo Simon stood up three times when Detroit succeeded in the first two innings, once in the sixth and once again in the ninth innings.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 shifts in a good game and released three runs.
He's only had three good beginnings on nine out shifts.
"I just want to end the season strongly this year," Simon said.
"It's hard for an alternative player to throw every game, and that's why I want to pitch until the sixth shift."
Victor Martinez, the substitute pitcher of the Tigers, got three hits and hit two runs, which were his first beatings since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-shot night after he got four hits against Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He hit well," Ausmus said.
"He looks good in batting practice and kept the vigor in the game."
In the second shift of the seventh inning, Twins had the best chance of getting back into the game.
Byron Buxton, the middle man, started the shift with a two-chamber hit close to the left sideline.
The real catcher Aaron Hicks hit the sacrifice, and Simon took second Brian Dozier, who took three straight assists before he was replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Herdy got a free pass for Mauer, and the new pitcher's replacement, Miguel Sano, hit two nests, and after her, Drew VerHagen, the right-handed guy, came in.
When there were two runners in the field, VerHagen got the third Trevor Plouffen to burn two players.
Major League team led 27 times this season when Plouffe burned two players.
After Detroit's first shift of the ninth shift in the certifying run, Tigers' finalist Bruce Rondon struck two races, and the score was five to four.
However, the right-handed pitcher threw three straight assists and was able to keep his team in position.
Detroit took advantage of the fact that Phil Hughes was a little rusty.
Tigers got three runs in the first two shifts against a right-handed old man who just got off the list of injured people back to the fields.
"Of course, the beginning was not what I would have liked. However, as the game progressed, I began to feel more comfortable, and I was able to do a good job and a few good assists in the third inning," Hughes said.
When Hughes was in charge, he gave one shot to Ian Kinsler in the first inning.
The real catcher J.D. Martinez's free ride brought Victor Martinez the first race of the game.
Victor Martinez's 0/21 tube was cut when the team had players at the base.
A third Nick Castellanos was next hit by one nest, one run, but Victor Martinez was burned trying to move on to three.
Tigers increased his lead in the second inning, and catcher James McCann survived the hit to second base and Anthony Gose to first base, when the score was 3-0.
"What a hit," commented Paul Molitor, the Twins coach.
"He didn't hit very well, but the punch hit the right spot."
The pitch was Hughes, who fed the untended third inning, and then he was replaced by A.J. Achter with a right-handed substitute.
Hughes' balance was three runs, six hits, freeball and four straight assists.
Notable: Tigers' right-handed hitter, Anibal Sanchez, was not in the lineup due to a tear in the batten shoulder.
The shoulder is being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who cut off Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of injured persons due to a shoulder rupture since mid-August, and he was supposed to be on Wednesday.
When Sanchez doesn't play, left-handed striker Daniel Norris leaves the list of injured people and is in the starting lineup against Twins.
Norris has been awarded 1-1 in four games since he was replaced by his left-handed striker David Price on 30 July.
He's been out of the lineup since August 20, due to a rupture of the slanted abs.
Tigers and Twins finish their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, mean running value: 4.43) receives Ervin Santana (5-4, mean running value: 4.73), a right-handed passer from Minnesota.
