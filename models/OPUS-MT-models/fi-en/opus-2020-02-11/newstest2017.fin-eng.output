28-year-old chef was found dead in a mall in San Francisco.
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping mall this week.
But the victim's brother says he doesn't know anyone who wanted to hurt him and says, "His business finally went well."
The body found at the Westfield Mall shopping center on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old Sanfranciscola Frank Galicia, said the San Francisco coroner's office.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was defined as a homicide and that the investigation was ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABC channel in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously served as a regular chef in Boston, had been given his dream job as the manager of the San Francisco Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
The Sons & Daughters representative said they were "horrored and shocked" because of his death.
"We have a small team that acts like a close family, and he will be missed very much," the representative said.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank was staying at the hostels at the beginning, but that recently "his affairs were finally going well".
"He found an apartment and was seeing a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was benevolent and had a big heart.
His way of feeling united with the family was to make us food, make dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of dispute.
He was a brother drifting with the current.
"In a world where so many things are wrong, he was an uncut diamond that shone brighter every day," he said.
Anyone with information will be asked to call the San Francisco Police Department hotline 415-575-4444.
Medical interns on strike: Requirements for new industrial action
The representatives of doctors' trainees have asked their trade union to adopt new industrial combat measures in their dispute over the new agreement.
The Committee of the British Medical Association (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) invites the Council as a whole to support new industrial action measures from the beginning of September.
JDC says that ministers have not been able to take up concerns about the agreement.
In July, doctors' trainees and medical students voted to reject the agreement with BMA.
It was rejected by 58 % of the members who voted.
On Thursday evening, in a letter published via Twitter to Members, Mr Ellen McCourt, President of the JDC, said that the government had remained "constantly silent" on the issues which, he said, led to the rejection of the agreement.
He said: "In this light, the JDC Government has voted to completely reject the proposed new agreement and to call for formal renegotiations of all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Government has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to obtain a mandate for the progressive and expanding industrial action programme starting early in September.
The dispute has resulted in the participation of medical trainees in six strikes this year, including the first complete stoppage in the history of the NHS health system.
The director of BMA's medical trainees, Dr Johann Malawia, resigned after the vote had rejected the terms of the agreement recommended by BMA.
He had informed members of BMA at meetings before the vote of 54 000 doctors and students that the agreement was good and should be approved.
After the vote, the Minister for Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the agreement would be imposed on doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: a consortium of outsiders?
Ele, who ended up in a crisis.
On Tuesday, the leaders of Russia and Turkey met to shake hands and declare the eight-month struggle for words and economic sanctions officially over.
But as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of St. Petersburg's palace, I got the clear impression that Ankara wants more of this reconciliation.
Yes, we shook hands at the event.
But Putin's smile seemed forced, and he didn't have much heat, even according to his own controlled standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, kept talking about his "loving friend" Putin - five times according to a report.
I lost count.
He also swore that relations with Russia would return not only to pre-crisis levels but even to better levels.
The next day the newspapers here described Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad ever happened.
In my opinion, his zeal reflected the opposite.
But the coolness of Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the reason for the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian combat plane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at that time was fierce.
Putin attacked Ankara for stabbing Moscow in the back.
The insult was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months the state-controlled media led to an amazing, thorough attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were responsible for everything.
The most serious were the allegations of high officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in Syrian territories dominated by ISIS.
He has strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it is time to move on.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he had requested from President Erdogan.
Russia won some kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of agreeing a truce are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost deposed from power in the failed coup of last month.
He has also been clearly shaken by the continuing terrorist attacks in Turkey.
There is also an economic motive.
The Russian economic sanctions have been heavy, especially the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, local tour operators and charter airlines are bound to be relieved when the flights eventually continue.
They're hoping for a late season rush to the Mediterranean.
And even this week, the state television has predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables after the release of agricultural products from Turkey again.
"Tourist back there, tomatoes back here," as the Vedemost newspaper reported.
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
In Ankara, people are angry at the West for what is considered a weak response to the attempted coup.
Adding a long-standing grudge against the EU negotiations on snails, Mr Putin, who is eager to take advantage of the coolness and undermine Turkey's ties with the West, will emerge.
The Russian leader certainly got points from Ankara, where he called after a revolution attempt to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is obvious to Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of a change of power.
So this meeting at the Prady Sea Palace made it possible for Russia and Turkey to introduce an 'outside association', as one analyst described the situation to me: two countries that feel abandoned and mistreated by the West, to join forces.
These two, however, have major differences despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently adapted itself to the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite.
It may be a lot to say that after almost three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even dealt with it.
The Turkish President deliberately avoided answering the question about their differences, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can look for a common basis for Syria.
After months of open hostility, and given the possibility of a full disaster as NATO member Turkey shoots down a Russian combat aircraft, it is certainly better that two leaders are even speaking again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear from customers outside Scotland
According to the Managing Director of the Bank, the RBS brand will be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the Bank's international objectives.
Since the bank almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved, it has abandoned these objectives.
The Bank's strategies have used the RBS brand to protect other consumer financial brands during this period.
It was supported by millions of pounds spent sponsoring international sports, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon Master Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to allow more national brands to come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is in use with Scottish customers, but it will not be restarted.
In England and Wales, all RBS references except the main office and stock exchange listings will be converted into NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use for Irish and Northern Ireland customers.
There are other smaller private banking brands that will get more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed on a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will become our investor brand and our employees' employer, because we are now becoming much more of a brand bank."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global goals, we have local targets.
Each of these brands means something very different in its own communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor Six Nations and has raised the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It is now time for us to move towards a brand bank, because in essence (we have asked questions) it is about how we can focus on making this a better bank for our customers," the CEO said.
Three years ago I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we have done focused on the needs of our customers, not on our own, I think you will see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think it's time.
Frankie Dettori wins in Newmarket with Predilection and wins 3,000 wins
Dettori sprays champagne after a double win with a total of 3,000 wins
Competitor Frankie Dettori confirmed his 3000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He won a milestone in his second victory on his home track while competing with John Gosden's trained Predilection.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in racing.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who used to win at Ghayyar, said, "This is special."
I'm very emotional because my family's here too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket because here I started 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not Royal Ascot. It's a normal Friday night and 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
Dettori sucks cheers when he brings out Predilection after victory.
Two race riders have achieved this milestone in the obstacle competitions - master jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4300 wins in his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggot, 9-time Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best riders in the present era, and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone, which few have achieved before him.
He's elegant and strong, but his tactical wit separates him from the rest of the weighing room.
He's a great ambassador to the competitions, his enthusiasm and charisma have been pulling fans into the sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have been riding 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a biker for weekends and big games!
Speaking seriously, Frankie has been riding winners in Great Britain for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He is a lively person who is a good thing for the British race, but he is also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a flyback landing from the saddle.
From flying endings to flying landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British racing for two decades.
This has been a roller coaster.
A lot of winnings in the big games, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' victory in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived the plane crash and suffered a ban on drugs.
Three years ago, he had a hard time coming back after six months of non-competition, but he showed considerable strength in challenging the skeptics and returning in his best condition.
And he may continue for a long time - Dettori has previously said that he would like to continue competing until at least 50 years of age.
Putin from Russia is dismissed by Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
The Russian President Vladimir Putin has suddenly fired Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin's statement stated that Putin had "ordered Ivanov to move away from the leadership of the Russian presidential regime" but was not given any reason.
The Deputy Director of Ivanov since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia, in 2012, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later he led the president's protocol and government staff, says the Kremlin website (Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your action as Head of State in terms of drafting laws and managing the implementation of your guidelines.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his seat and recommended that Persecution be replaced.
Are smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like Putin, served as the Soviet Security Service in the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a public television meeting with President Putin, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff withdrew at their own request.
But despite smiling at the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is this just some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man once advertised as a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to lead the Russian environment policy has been received with real scepticism.
In his comments to Putin quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said "It is true that early in 2012 I asked you to give me this very complicated, even laborious, task for four years in the debate.
Well, now I've been Chief of Staff for four years and eight months."
Ivanov approved the mission in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service in the KGB, as well as Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the State Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed Deputy Director.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become President Puti of Russia after the second period, as Puti's third period would have been unconstitutional.
However, this mission went to another associate close to Putin, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before he returned to office only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson got fired after beating the producer.
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute last month at a series set in Los Angeles.
A series of producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, reported his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
There were creative differences and quarrels on the set.
I regret that it happened," he said in his statement.
According to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios' statement, details of how Gibson's character is removed from a series of FBI agents are expected later.
The 54-year-old who used to star at Dharma & Greg has been in the series since its first season in 2005.
"I love the Criminal Minds series, and I have given it everything I can for the past 12 years," Gibson said in a statement published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that is not possible at the moment.
I just want to thank the authors, the producers, the actors, our incredible team and, above all, the best fans the show can have.
The beginning of the 12th production season of the series is planned for September 28.
Mysterious fish ended up in a garden in Banff.
A man in Banff has asked for help in identifying the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be windfish left behind by a water cyclone.
Bain, 500 meters from the sea, published film material in Periscope, hoping that someone could bring clarity to the appearance of two - inch - long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now extends to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have combined the northern deck of Queensferry's overpass and the land bridge, which means that the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of the four brackets between the "folders" that are now about to be completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tons.
It has 10 000 tons of steel and 20 000 tons of concrete and 46 bars.
The £1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Finance Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry overpass.
We are all witnessing truly impressive engineering work in this project, which uses more than 30 000 tons of concrete and steel alone to build this bridge section."
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, the closing of the bridge between the ground bridge and the bridge deck is a demanding operation in which extreme dimensions must match.
All in all, almost 79% of the bridge deck is now in place and the concrete cover for the last part of the deck is cast today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to the bridge.
Michael Martin, Head of Fort Crossing Bridge Constructions, said: "The first lock in any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this lock represents the cutting edge of construction technology.
After the last section of the road deck was installed and connected to the expanding northern pillar road deck, we then had to close the remaining section from the north, that is to say, from the inland side.
This was done by pulling the bridge 700 mm southward.
This was a huge and at the same time very demanding measure.
A huge bridge, 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled at an angle of inclination of about 3%.
Requisite, because the tolerances that the team worked with were tiny, just a few millimeters in each direction.
But I'm glad everything went well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men are "lucky when they're alive"
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after they fell off their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The rescue boat station Moelfre RNLI made an alarm at 1.20 p.m. (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event develop in the Bay of Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety as their boat moved on by itself.
"We saw the boat moving closer to the men and imagining the worst," said Vince Jones, the pilot of the Moelfre lifeboat.
"Thankfully, the strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we were able to move," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, and the third man, 60 years old, was found exhausted hanging from a buoy without life jackets.
The men were taken to the rescue boat and brought back to the rescue boat station.
Jones said, "These three men in the water are lucky to be alive and completely undamaged.
The boat's engine had a kill switch on it, but it was somehow detached from the person driving the boat when the boat crashed.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectable hunting for health and happiness
It's fascinating to see the world change.
Over the past decade, many people have been worried that teenagers and children are no longer going out to play, but that they prefer to spend their free time watching screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get off the couch and take part in some activity.
The display time was originally limited to television, then video games, and now, recently, smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activity are not mutually exclusive.
I refer, of course, to a fad called Pokémon Go. An application based on characters originally developed in the 1990s for video games (later they produced a cartoon series, playing cards and other follow-up products).
Like many pop-culture phenomena, its popularity had become somewhat diluted before this new game was released in the United States, Australia and New Zealand early in July.
After the game release in other countries was postponed, as huge popularity overloaded servers.
Only in days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
Then how does it work?
When explained in a nutshell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémons, which are tracked by GPS, and which after discovery can be "photos" (via the screenshot of a phone) or "caught".
The generation who played the game at an early age has joined the fad and jumped off the couch to join the search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the daily steps of the "average person".
The Apple Watch app Cardiogram, which monitors 35 000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of the game's release, the number of people moving 30 minutes a day jumped from 45% to 53% of users followed by Cardiogram.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Gota, it only sees the training level data.
Many of the public health campaigns 'found 30', 'nouse on the couch' and 'be active every day' have produced no results because the majority of public health warnings are boring and are transmitted by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
Regularly moving people have a lower risk of developing cancer or depression.
Activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure and diabetes. Its benefits are too diverse to be listed here.
The beauty of Pokémon Go is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine and fun.
Some people even make new friends when hunting.
As usual, disgruntled pranksters are looking for things to complain about.
Yes, someone can walk to the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Although there were previously apps like Fitbit that could monitor activity, they did not give reason to move in the same way as this game.
The new attraction disappears and the use will eventually fade away.
However, because of Pokémon's success, there will be other games that combine applications and virtual reality with real world activity, helping many hunting people to be more active, better condition and healthier.

Simone Biles grabbed gold in a women's gymnasium multi-match
Forget the pressure.
Forget the publicity snort.
Simone Biles is immune to all that.
It's energetic when you jump.
It's smooth on the boom.
I can't believe it. It's a permanto.
Great everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old American gymnast won the multi-match championship on Thursday, leaving the gap between himself and the rest of the world to the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
His total score, 62.198, was clearly better than the Silver Medalist and Final Five teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Alya Mustafina.
At the balance bar of Simone Biles in the US, women's gymnasium multi-matching individuals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
Party became the fourth American woman to win the multi-match championship in succession, and the fifth American champion in all, while at the same time strengthening her reputation as the best of her generation, and perhaps the best of all time.
He burst into tears when his final score was announced, and his long journey toward this moment ended.
This achievement raises him to the same level as other best athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their species to a new level:
Biles has dominated his sport for the last three years, winning 15 World Championships, including 10 gold, with programs whose combination of ambition and precision has been so amazing that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best gymnast I've ever seen".
The final test was in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and other competitors, but between him and the burden of excessive expectations.
Returning to the family home in Spring, Texas, without a handful of gold medals would have been disappointing.
Simone Biles of the United States, on the left, and Aly Raisman, after winning the gold and silver medal (in this order), will hug women's gymnasium in the multimatch of individuals at the finals of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday, Aug.
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday when he was the culmination of the departure party of the retired national team coordinator Martha Karolyin.
Although Biles claimed that he never thought about the future as he went his long way to the top, it is not entirely truthful.
Part of his permanto program - which includes his trademark voltti-hide - is adapted to Latin American music, which would also be ideal for the street next to the Rio Olympic arena.
This isn't a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, and found by Coach Aimee Boorman's mother when she was on her way to college at the gym where Boorman trained, has become a powermaker.
He hasn't lost in a multi-match since summer 2013, and this winning streak should last as long as he wants to.
Even though Mustafina was in a little lead after two rounds, it was just an illusion.
The balance boom and the permanto, in which Biles is the reigning world champion, were waiting.
He took the lead at the boom points 15.433 and crossed them with 15.933 permanto.
Raisman hugged him benevolently as they waited for the final score -- mere formality -- and tears rose to the limited eyes of Balaam's Glitter, White, and Blue, when the dream he once wrote about in his scrapbook came true.
Raisman's performance was some kind of rematch from four years ago when he was in a divided third place, but lost the bronze to the Mustafina in the renewal.
This time the 22-year-old team leader, who the Americans call "Grandmother", was clearly in charge.
He sent air kisses to the audience after his perm performance in an emotional state of return, which at times seemed questionable.
As far as Balaam is concerned, the widespread tweeting of this 19-year-old from earlier this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in a serial murder were shot while they were listening to music in the car.
Two women and a 12-year-old girl, killed in the first serial killer attack in Phoenix last decade, sat in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, as reported in a police release published on Thursday.
The authorities said that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked in a driveway on June 12.
The notice reports that the shooter standing on the passenger's side fired the handgun up to eight times and then fled on another vehicle.
According to the police, the triple homicide did not appear to have been the result of the robbery, since the attacker did not steal handbags or $2,900 from another adult victim.
Detective Jonathan Howard, a representative of the Phoenix Police Department, said that the shooting caused the investigators to examine whether it was linked to the four previous attacks.
In all, seven people have died and two have been wounded in nine attacks over four months, committed in two main Latin - American districts.
"These happen in the residential area in front of the home," Howard said earlier this month to CBS' subsidiary KPHO.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, such as the late 1990s brown Nissan, the late 1990s black BMW and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Scientists have refused to reveal evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks are related and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
An eyewitness told the police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police release on shooting, which took place only half an hour before the triple murder, targeting an empty pickup truck, which is also believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Scientists found bullet casings, bullet in the seat and bullet fragments in the engine compartment.
Mother of 6 years of age with microcephaly: "It will get easier"
Edmund Picciuto, like most other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But, unlike most of his peers, Edmund is small - headed, as a result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know when she was pregnant.
"When he first came home, my first idea was that I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
This is not what I signed up for.
Which is not true at all - of course I promised," he said.
He and his husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund may never learn to recognize them, and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that 'I didn't know people were still doing it'," Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks on a walker.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he slowly reaches some milestones.
He walks with help and rides a bicycle.
And he loves to play with his two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth will show you how to sign the signs Edmund invented for "sing to me."
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not an ordinary sign language. He tells me that Edmund has invented some of his own signs.
Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of causes: genetic infections, such as Edmund's, or viral infections during pregnancy such as measles or Zika virus.
Symptoms and predictions can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it affects the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden of an uncertain future.
I was just asking what was going to happen.
What's gonna happen?
And he still doesn't know.
In fact, I haven't asked for a forecast in a long time, because I don't expect anyone to actually be able to give me one.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defect due to Zika.
Things will get easier.
You can believe it's gonna get easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Heavy rain and floods caused rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi
The heavy rain and widespread floods in Louisiana led the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday.
The National Weather Service reported that several rivers in southeastern Louisiana and the Southern Mississippi flooded their banks and caused a widespread flood threat due to extreme rainfall.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said that the state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and that assistance is already coming to the districts that need it.
Mike Steele, a representative of the Governor's Safety and Emergency Response Office, said they're getting requests for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that the Tangipaho County alone asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood watch is valid until Saturday in a large part of southern Louisiana.
The Weather Service said in a statement that an additional three to five centimetres of rain is expected in the area.
In southern Alabama, the flood watch was valid on Friday as the rain continued in Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs are both located in Louisiana and were predicted to set a flood record during the weekend.
Weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood several houses in suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that there is a threat of flooding the Ascension County, which is lower along the river, as the flooding rivers slowly descend into Lake Maurepas.
South of the state border of Mississippi, the Tickfaw River in Liverpool, Louisiana, was at the highest ever level on Friday morning at 9 a.m.
The rescuers were still picking people out of the floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson districts in Southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and stepson were near Glolor on Friday among the rescued.
The 62-year-old Hansford says that normally more than 400 feet from his house, Beaver Creek's water rose rapidly during the night.
He says he was warned by another stepson who lives nearby.
"We woke up, and the water kept rising," Hansford said.
It went all the way to my waist.
Hansford's wife told her husband that she has not seen the water of the brook so high in the 48 years she has lived there.
Hansford said that he and his family all had injuries, and that he was the only one capable of swimming.
Hansford said that the rescue workers rescued the three in a large military-style truck and took them to Glolor's fire station, where the rescued stayed on Friday.
Krautmann says that floods "will spread rapidly" as heavy rains continue, and that authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says that an eyewitness near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the country was completely saturated with the heavy rain that has been going on since Wednesday.
The heavy rain and flooding led to the rescue of the residents of Tangipaho County from their homes and the cancellation of lessons in five school districts, the authorities reported.
CBS's subsidiary WWL reported that a member of the City Council in Tangipaho said that 200 homes were flooded.
The inhabitants had been evacuated to two churches, but both are now flooded.
The district president, Robby Miller, said that the authorities rescued 72 people and 7 pets who had been surrounded by high tides.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, shelters have been opened for those who have been evacuated.
"They can go back to their homes when the water starts to go down," he said.
In the city of Hammond in Tangipaho County, some 20 streets were closed because of the tide, and residents were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
"The last great flood here was in March," said Lacy Landrum, the city's administrative authority.
This is becoming a similar case.
In Mississippi, Rupert Lacy, emergency director of Harrison County, said that steady rain continued along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that on Thursday a handful of houses were reported to have flooded, but so far no floods have been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of the Shopper Value Foods movement in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and the rain continues."
A six-year-old Mahaj Brown, full of bullets, survives the shooting in Philadelphia.
Police report that a six - year - old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which means another six - year - old shot in the city this week.
The child's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name was Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say that Brown had several gunshot wounds to his groin, leg, hand, and stomach, among other things, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets," says his grandmother Delores Melendez to the station.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the boy's condition has been recorded as critical and has undergone several operations.
The family will tell the station he's expected to recover.
The boy was starting his first grade at the local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown block.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-olds.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were in stable state according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car together with a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reported.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be the shooter.
Scientists tell CBS Philadelphia that it looks like there was a crossfire between several shooters.
The shell casings of the type of attack weapon that came from various types of attack weapon filled the scene.
It seems that this was definitely an ongoing battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
"So it seems that there were several armed fighters here, and that they were in active combat," Anthony Ginaldi, chief of police in Philadelphia told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made, and according to reports, the police are investigating surveillance tapes.
Another six-year-old, a girl, got hit by a stray bullet in her hand on Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That's how I call this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been to every summer Olympic Games since 1984, and the USA has never been so dominant.
And secondly: This team includes three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of this team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
This team looks like, finally, America.
It has also established the presence of black and Latin - American women at the top of the species.
For the past four years, the most successful female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were the first and second.
This is great.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised me as an Olympic winner, and America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three times the world champion Simone Party, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who perform unexpected but masterful gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to win consecutively individual gold in a women's multimatch.
And teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the top of the species, but it doesn't look like this in gymnasiums all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie were all on the same path as Aly and Madison when they reached the Olympic team.
They are "Final Five" (last five), because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karolyin's last year as coach.
The reality, however, is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts generally practice in private gymnasium clubs, maintained by parents who pay training, facilities, travels, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list continues.
Much of these gymnasium clubs are located in prosperous suburbs that can support the species.
In these clubs gymnasts get all their training, and this is an expensive and long - term commitment to the families of gymnasts.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Party coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez coach, have both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to bring more affordable and available gymnastics training to communities where many young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby, and Laurie live.
I started my gym foundation 20 years ago.
In my organisations, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem to over 15 000 urban youth (mainly black and Latin) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this remarkable Olympic sport.
Gymnasts develop body strength, flexibility and coordination, as well as mental diligence, discipline and determination.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for good health, school and work success.
This team inspiration makes thousands of young girls start gymnasts, and that's great.
Participation in sport is so important, especially for girls.
We live in an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing serious "girl power" by winning the Olympic team gold, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road to healthy, strong and successful young ladyhood.
Medical interns organizing new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association staff, but 58% of 37,000 doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the agreement, saying that the NHS was on "unknown soil" and that even minor further delays harm the staff and patients.
The first medical trainees will be transferred to a new contract, which will include changes to the night and weekend working methods to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Medical Trainer Committee, said in a statement last night: "Doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, especially as it accelerates the existing labour crisis and does not treat all doctors equally."
With only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new agreement, progress must be made and time is running out.
BMA's attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have met with the government's reluctance to participate and sometimes deep silence.
Despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, remove the coercion and take into account the concerns of medical trainees.
If he does not do so, medical interns will be prepared to continue their work-fighting activities.
The latest strike at the end of April meant the postponement of nearly 13 000 routine surgery and 100 000 reception times when nurses and consultants were recruited to replace doctors on strike watch.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over changes by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association staff.
BMA wants a better weekend salary for those under contract with 54 000 doctors.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, appealed to medical trainees to prevent them from going on strike.
Mortimer said: "Work battles achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already in a demanding situation and cause concern, anxiety and disturbances to patients, carers and their families."
Over the past two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervision (Guardian Role) and whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that the ongoing positive debate on other important issues - such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from sabbatical leave, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay differentials in medicine - will mark the seriousness of the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
A £2 a day medicine can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from a £2 a day medicine after the authorities recommended that it be given to people for longer.
The anticoagulant, ticagrelor, reduces the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
The medicine is already given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or another attack.
NICE, an NHS overseer, has advised that it should be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NICE, an NHS overseer, has advised that it should be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140 000 people have a heart attack every year in England, and a quarter of them have a second attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty matter in the artery wall that forms stenosis.
If the stenosis ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that prevents the blood flow to the heart causing a heart attack.
If a clot is released, it can pass through the blood and cut off the blood circulation into the brain causing a stroke.
People who have already had one attack have an increased risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by AstraZeneca, a company in Great Britain, and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clotting less likely.
Today's draft guidance for NICE recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months followed by 60 mg twice daily with aspirin for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "Without concern about the availability of effective treatments to prevent progression, as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack will later have another heart attack or stroke, with often devastating consequences."
Fear of regeneration can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
When we first recommend ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to increase the available treatment options for several thousand people who may benefit from them.
Due to the limited efficacy and safety data for ticagrelor - especially with regard to the risk of bleeding - over periods of more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend treatment longer than this period.
A culture of political correctness allows electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim regions
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year for corruption, giving impetus to the government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities being ignored, is revealed today in a shocking government report.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles chisels the police, electoral officers and city councils for ignoring evidence of electoral fraud because of "racial and religious oversensitivity".
The former Community Secretary, the current emperor of anti-corruption, said that intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so serious that the police should be allowed to place guard chains outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He recommends that voters should present an identity card when voting to prove who they are.
Today, voters only have to say their name and address.
The report even proposes that the voter's finger be placed with insatiable ink so that no one can vote twice.
The whistleblowers should be better protected, Sir Eric says.
He calls for greater access for the press to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working parties.
"This would not only protect against electoral fraud, but would protect local government from a culture of corruption and economic fraud that goes hand in hand with electoral fraud," he said.
The government commissioned a report following the vote scandal in Tower Hamlets, East London.
Last year, the Special Election Court decided that the President-in-Office, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office as a result of numerous charges of corruption and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman "enoughly distorted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and fear of Islam.
Rahman is said to have led his election campaign on the grounds that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him.
Up to 300 votes were questionable or the result of a person's voting in another form.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed his particular concern at the vote on election fraud by post, where high-ranking members of the Muslim community were said to have put pressure on people to vote for the candidate they elected.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made several recommendations for the clearance of the voting system, including identification with an identity card.
He says: "The evidence was presented that vulnerable members of the communities of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities with Pakistani or Bangaldesh backgrounds.
"The concerns were raised that...the institutions of the state had ignored such behaviour because of the 'politically correct' hypersensitivity to race and religion."
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals to clean up the system, including a ban on political activists being allowed to deal with postal ballots in order to put an end to the 'voice collection'.
The report that Theresa May is considering also calls for more stringent amendments to registrations in order to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Consider options for proving the identity of voters before voting.
Use the finger of a person who votes for incorruptible ink so that no one can vote twice.
Perform systematic nationality checks to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
Set a limit of three years for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prevent political activists from dealing with ready-made sounds and envelopes sent through the mail.
Let the police put guard chains around the polling stations.
Change the law to make it easier to accuse people of intimidation on the basis of the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photography illegal at polling stations.
Require that only English is used at polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen the training to ensure that the staff adheres to the rule that voters should go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric is cutting off the Grand London police force saying it's "surprising" that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlets incident.
"The electoral court stayed behind as a result of the numerous corruption and illegal activities of Lutfur Rahman and his officers," he said.
He was found guilty on the basis of a number of grounds without doubt, according to the criminal evidence threshold.
He also criticised inefficient "tick-to-box checks" in the voting registration offices of city councils.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's Tower Hamlets sentence was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a glorious legacy as the birther of parliaments, but this worrying and secretive spread of electoral fraud and the denial of the facts of certain groups threaten this good reputation."
Crazy for Kate's bicyclist twin and other famous pictures at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics have gone crazy from French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be the impressive duchess of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who can brag about his own famous double - at least according to social media.
So in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and Wolf: Member of the U.S. men's archery team Brady Ellison on the left has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's doppelganger found on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the star Leonardo DiCaprio's twin.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's archery team, has caused a storm on Twitter since his images surfaced, where he looks frighteningly like the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And in fact, as he became aware of the passion of social media, the archer admitted that he has heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I don't see much resemblance, but maybe with a beard," Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will certainly also come up this year: the striking resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina with her big, expressive eyes has been said to be Gloria Estefan's doppelganger, a Cuban-American singer.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burghia has been compared for years to Glee Star Matthew Morrison.
Bigger gear in the eye: This user thinks Nathan is the "sporty version" of the Inception actor
Another long-term comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, both with similar strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more than just the same actor Annalynne McCord than tan skin and blond hair, while U.S. team Nathan Adrian reminds fans of "Joseph Gordon Levitt's athletic version".
Hard Women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter, right, share a similar face shape and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Presentation of the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason between a couple of similarities
A Twitter user recently expressed his happiness on the website that "others on the Internet also think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And the American football star and Dexter's actress really have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, as well as Gabby Douglas, the gold medal winner, whose own beautiful wide smile matches the smile of the Bring It Star Gabrielle Union.
The CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying the Chinese swimmer "dead as a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth message from the women's 4x200-metre free swim was infuriated by the CBC's direct Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
The Canadian television company CBC has had to apologize since one of its commentators said during the race that a 14-year-old Chinese female swimmer "lost like a bad smell" and "dead as a pig".
The commentator Byron MacDonald thought that his microphone was off when he started sharing some of his own opinions in the women's 4x200-meter free-dipping finale.
MacDonald, who came to CBC's reporting team with "color", was heard saying, "That little 14-year-old from China screwed up, baby.
Too eager, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second part of the message at 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canada to catch China.
Viewers from all over Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC commentator just say that China's 14-year-old swimmer 'dead like a pig'???
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air."
China's Ai Yanhan was described as "The little 14-year-old from China screwed up, baby."
The review against Byron MacDonald on Twitter was very strong and fast, with many challenging him.
Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how oblivious Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like racist people.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who was running CBC, apologized on live television for MacDonald's comment, saying: "We regret that the comment about the swim performance was on the air.
It was an unfortunate choice of words; we are sorry that this has happened."
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to a comment.
Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
The CBC then copied and attached an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The TV company also quickly apologized and published a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and that they were sent live.
Last night we acted quickly and apologized to our viewers and our followers on the social media live.
For the sake of clarity, Mr Byron's comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he has said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on live television and tried to define his remark by saying that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize in the moment for the comment I made last night after the message from the women," he said at the CBC Olympic broadcast.
"I referred to the swimmer's performance, not to him as a person."
"It's unnecessary to say that I didn't mean it as disrespectful, and that I'm really sorry."
Primark's client is dismayed by a woman who brazenly tried on underwear in the middle of the store.
The customers didn't know where to look when a woman undressed in the middle of Primark's store to try on panties.
Things were not cured by the fact that, after assessing what he looked like in his pants, the woman removed them from her head and put them back on the shelf.
He continued his tour and finally made arrangements for four pairs of underpants at a shop in Folkestone, the shopping center of Bouverie Place.
Primark's shop at the Bouverie Place mall in Folkestone, where she made up her underwear and then put it back on the shelf.
At the same time, Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children in the store, said that after trying on underwear, the mysterious woman "redressed and walked away from the store without buying anything".
He said, "People didn't believe their eyes."
The woman stood in the middle of the store floor, took a pair of underpants on display, took off her own tights and underwear, and put them on.
"He didn't even try to find a remote place to fit in, he just stood there shameless."
"Everybody was staring at me while she took off her underwear again and obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
He did the same for three more couples before finally deciding that he didn't like anything he saw, dressed again and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care who was watching or thinking about the person who would end up buying the underwear he was fitting."
Davidson, a 33-year-old living in Kent City, said: "It's disgusting to think that someone is taking home underwear someone else has tried but has not been cleaned."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I realized that the staff apparently tried to remove items of clothing from the sale after the woman left, which is all right."
"It would be terrible to go home with new underpants and find that another woman has put them on and stripped them off, and they have not been washed."
Primark's representative said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place at Folkestone's store on Tuesday, August 9th.
All the products concerned have been removed from the market.'
This allows you to defend yourself against armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Mr. Rhon Mizrach, the Great Master of the Krav Maga Federation, who lives in New York City to find out how to deal with gun - waving robbers at close range.
Whether we approach you from the front or the back, this video shows how you can pay the attacker the same amount.
According to Mizrach, if you are approached from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around so you can see your attacker and "remove the line of fire".
Then you grab the gun between the forearm and the shoulder before hitting the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Keep on hitting the groin with the knee, and when the attacker goes from pain to pain, twist the gun from his hands, hit him at the back of the gun in the face and stand back while the gun is pointed at him.
If an armed person approaches the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the gun and turn it around so that the criminal cannot launch.
At the same time put some weight on the gun and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun out of his grip, back off and point the gun at him.
Does that sound difficult to you?
Check the video to see exactly how Mizrachi is doing this.
But remember, if you're not the great master of Krav Maga, the safest way out of a robbery is to give up your money.
Traveler Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe for a travel guide
The British traveler has put a serious challenge to his immune system and vomit reflexes by licking some of Europe's dirtiest and most disgusting places.
The host and travel writer Ian Wright from Suffolk, 51, licked euro banknotes, railing at Piccadilly Circus, the toilet flush button on the train and the Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking every target, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was about to experience.
However, the experiment, which was made in a film called "Internal Power Tracking, " produced surprising results.
The idea of licking the flush button on a train used by thousands of people may seem completely repugnant, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in the sink in the kitchen.
On his way across Europe, Wright kept talking to doctors and medical professionals about the confirmation of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left him anything else in the mouth of the bad taste.
Wright became a well - known tester of the endurance of his bowels as he traveled around the world and ate strange and wonderful things.
This task of public rail rail rail rail rails to the toilet seat flush button really tested his immune system.
In the film he said: "From childhood I've been rather carefree about my health, and I've put all kinds of things in my mouth from soil, worms and curly water."
He really confirmed his reputation during the movie.
The only thing he refused was the filthy Russian public toilet.
His sample contained readings of over 4,000 units in the photometer.
For comparison, the reading of newly washed hands should be below 60.
But in a Russian public toilet he refused to lick when the photometer showed more than 4,000 units, and the newly washed hands were less than 60.
Wright has produced a traveler's film, internal power, together with a Finnish dairy, Valio. The film shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the movie, the wedding said, "This is almost the worst thing I've ever smelled in the bathroom."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting in here.
The inner force was produced together with the Finnish dairy, Valio.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as C and D vitamins that help to enhance human intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, director of Valio's snacks, juice and new categories, said: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at and at the same time explain the interests of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air and came up with the idea of 'let's call Ian'."
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: to tell about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and its connection to the immune system.
Growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and this documentary allows us to tell consumers more about it in an interesting way.
I think the document also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Document director Tom Hakala added: "Let's just say it this way: if Ian had licked some of the things I asked him for, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the movie, I would have lost my respect for him."
Understandably, some of the things licked were easier for Ian, while others were rather difficult.
I'm glad we could save some of those dirty licks."
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84% of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria specifically to the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58% said that they at least sometimes use products that have been added to lactic acid bacteria.
A bully family destroyed a rental house in Cornwall, Saltash, before eviction.
The bully family caused damage to their rental house of £50,000 after they were evicted because of the terrorist attacks on their neighbors.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of Cornwall's property in Saltash after numerous complaints have been made about them.
After they had been forcefully removed from the property, upset housing workers found the property to be in poor condition.
The walls were filled with gaping holes, floorboards were torn, waste was spread on the floor, and walls were stained with graffiti.
The family has now moved elsewhere and is believed to live in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, the manager of Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the property could not be repaired.
He said: "This has been a real nightmare for the residents, and I do not think people should have to live like this.
There are a lot to consider here because this property is likely to be known through Cornwall's less comfortable groups.
This family is infamous, and their names are infamous."
The couple had three sons who sometimes lived in the property, and according to the police, the family's reign of terror contained street fighting with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug abuse, drug sales, and excessive screaming, fighting, and cursing.
In June, 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was on the lease, received a decision on antisocial behaviour.
In many of the rooms of the house under the threat of demolition, old waste was found.
The property from which drugs were previously transmitted was pulled up.
Neighbors said that the family was seen fighting on the street and that the police were regularly called.
Cornwall Housing forcefully evicted a woman and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move voluntarily.
Relieved neighbors thanked the eviction, saying that their lives had become hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next door to them for 20 years, and it's always been a bad situation.
We've seen the police here an incredible number of times.
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet here we're not used to it!
It's wonderful, now that they're finally gone."
Adam Fitzpatrick, executive director of Cornwall Housing's neighborhood, said that the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often invited to the property.
Garbage and old toys have been thrown down the crazed wall of the rental house.
He added: "It is a pity that the resident did not take any responsibility for his or her own conduct, as eviction is always the last procedure considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, for the conduct was extreme, and their actions must have horrified the neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, Devon and Cornwall police, and the courageous members of the community who have given us information.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to our neighbours and send a message that anti-social behaviour will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys all lived in real estate at different times, but they were all in their twenties.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one bedroom after the eviction
The employees of the housing company must now clean up the waste surfaces around the house
In 2014, the police raided the property and found over 70 g of cannabis plus scales, supplies and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for admitting his guilt for possession of a class B drug as an intention to pass it on.
He claimed that the money was for his son Lee Skeldon's tombstone, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her associates live homeless now that they've been frozen in private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house were filled with graffiti.
The police say they're trying to evict the residents who make fun of the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall police said that the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.
"This is a message to those who think that their conduct is without consequences, as well as to those who suffer from such conduct," he said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behaviour, and the police will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a military jet flew low on the beach
Sun - worshiping tourists in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
The Portuguese Air Force's P-3C Orion plane swept past very low
The Air Force said that it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised.
Right now, terrified tourists began to panic as a low - plane jet swept over a crowded beach.
The dramatic recording shows how a military aircraft came close to contact with the sun worshipers on the sand strip of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The vacationers stood up when they began to understandably worry about the noise from the jet, even though they did not at first see what was coming from behind the clouds toward them.
The incident took place in Costa Nova, near Aveiro, yesterday afternoon.
One of the many vacationers who published videos of a dramatic pass in social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said: "It went by twice at a very low level, and in one place it looked like it was going down."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and really felt like the plane was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared out of the darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight designed to identify fishing boats near the coast and had to land so low that it was the only way to check the boats.
He said that the jet had flown much lower than usual due to the poor visibility of smoke from nearby fires, but the Air Force assured us that no one was in danger.
Land fires have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal this summer, and four people have died on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low due to the conditions that affected the visibility, the smoke caused by the fires and the thick fog.
The plane was on a training flight, and as part of the training, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats.
Exiting the result of the first half of the year better than expected
In January - June, the South Karelia Social and Health District (Exote) produced EUR 3.4 million better than planned.
Exit was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all operations.
Exote is trying to reduce the number of queues this year.
The ex post balance covers the deficit previously created by the surplus.
The excess may be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The result for the whole year is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
Exote's Board of Directors will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special frontier soldiers took a military oath in Immola
The 70 officers of the Border and Coast Guard School took a military oath on Friday.
The military oath ceremony of the Rangers and Coast Guard School was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th special frontier soldier course's oath was held in the military field.
The military oath was taken by 70 conscripts.
Special border soldiers are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat missions.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for special frontier medicine.
250 of them were invited to the selection tests.
Special frontier soldiers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans from the wartime border forces attended a veteran meeting in connection with the jury.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who attended the event were born in 1918.
A circle of robbers ahead - criminal intelligence helps solve crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 police departments in Finland has been operated by the RTA unit, i.e. criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible outwards.
The Häme Police Department comprises a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's being run by an officer stationed in Lahti.
Chief of Staff is Lieutenant Lahti.
In addition, the unit's strength includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone's working in a civilian uniform.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity," says Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides different investigations to the rest of the police.
In Häme it has, among other things, acquired information on asylum seekers.
Latest reform of working practices
The creation of analytical units is the most recent reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, that is to say, the police would never leave until they were alerted.
With the information collected and analysed by the unit, daily police activities are targeted where they are most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, a criminal intelligence centre, less than three national units were set up in the country and its own criminal intelligence unit was set up for each police department.
In Vantaa, the PTR Centre, which operates in conjunction with the Central Crime Police, is operating nationally.
PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and Border Guard.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas divided by police departments and are responsible for providing information to local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond your own territory
As far as the individual police are aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, it is up to the RTA unit to know what is going on throughout the area of the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of its own institution, because so does crime.
Those working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
With the help of registers, an alert task database and observations, the unit seeks to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive crime or similar crimes.
This is called seriesing, and it is one of the most important tools in criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it's honest or criminal.
Based on the method used, the unsub becomes a certain image.
It can be done either on the basis of the method of doing it or on the basis of a person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals Learn From Their Mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not travel around the city with their collars up, but their work is not entirely public either.
Neither the methods used by criminals nor those used by criminals are reported, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus seeking to prevent police attempts to combat crime.
The police will publicly report these methods if they anticipate a threat.
For example, such a case was reported in early summer, a method of marking vacant dwellings used in house break-ins.
It was the people who put a stick, a pin or a piece of tape on the front door of the apartment that they tried to see if the residents were really out of town.
The pre-trial material shall be made public at least to the parties concerned.
The unit of analysis has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The cleverer order the District Court minutes, which may indicate, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the site.
Next time, we're going to steal gloves.
The case has been interviewed by Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppä of the Häme Police, Inspector Tuomo Lepola of the Eastern Finland Police, Detective Commissioner Sami Joutjärvi of the Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuumela of the Central Crime Police.
The police collect and analyse information that is used to plan practical activities.
In the background, the reduction in labour and financial resources.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was a three-stage PORA reform which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside the boundaries of the institution and Finland.
A schoolgirl who joined Daddy from London killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, has been rumored to have died in Syria.
Tasname Akunjee, a lawyer, said that her family heard that she died in Syria a few weeks ago.
On Thursday, ITV News reported that the girl was believed to have died in a Russian air strike in Ramba, an organization's base in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old, and, after her family, she died just as she was planning an escape from a war-torn country and her return to Britain.
"You can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can serve as a tombstone and a will for others, that there are real risks of going to the war zone - that it could cause people to give up making such a decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London schoolgirls flew to Turkey, where they took the bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family were told that she had married an Isis fighter in Syria and that she became a widow after only a few months.
Reid says Clinton will consider Garland's Supreme Court candidate if he is elected.
Senator Harry Reid says he is convinced that the Democratic candidate for President Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected President.
The Senate Republicans have been blocking Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Mitch McConnell, leader of the Senate majority, says that the next president will replace Anton Scalia, the late Supreme Court member.
Reid said on Thursday at the phone conference that he predicted "some degree of certainty" Clinton would choose Garland.
Reid's representative later said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would appoint Garland and that it was speculation.
He complimented Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "draw a boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. Court of Appeal in District of Columbia.
Reid said that the Republicans who block Garland's nomination are Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's "handlers" and "advantages".
He said Trump wasn't fit for office.
Treats says the naked calendar is "for women as well as for men"
The Treats magazine works with photographer David Bellemer to publish the calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they're going to find the next top model generation in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
The president of the treats, Steve Shaw, told us earlier this year that his magazine with plenty of naked pictures differs from the old school Playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is for them too.
"We have to start showing timeless and classic nakedness where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of naked female bodies," Shaw said in a press release in which the calendar was published.
Women want to be part of this project because it's beautiful art.
Models can leave images online or in personally open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl's destination: who actually buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men love quills.
Before you rush to fill out the commentary section with irritated insults written by the nickname NoAll LonelyMen, you will find that this claim is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed new coming of records is not because more and more people born in this millennium are enthusiastic about the novelty of physical objects, but about the longing of middle age.
Apparently, those who recently bought a vinyl disc are most likely to be between 45 and 54 years old.
In fact, those of the 18-24-year-old age group who are less likely to buy records.
Nor is it just a matter of collecting enthusiasts, but it has an emotional significance: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings within (56% vs 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs 66%).
But is the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walk through the busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit. I'd be signaling a lot before I stopped, making a cup out of my hands and saying something authoritative, like, "Let's take a closer look at it."
Let's take a closer look.
While Soho's charm and dirt are slowly being removed, hotels, chain restaurants and shops and office supplies now fill buildings with previously independent stores - a handful of great specialized record stores still remain.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop filming for a moment, as I stand very close to different men in some of these stores while trying to evaluate their age and emotional temperament.
Stuart of Glasgow, 55, followed by Sister Ray (counter: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in 20), spends her afternoon in London for a meeting, and is going around shops to spend a few hours.
I'll see if he's a collector.
"I guess I am," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 albums.
These plates, which appear above the picture (he sent a sample by email, I didn't follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for such an enormous volume of disks and singles is partly due to his disposable income: now he can buy records that he could not afford when they were originally released and he can re-buy those he sold when he was young and broke.
"A large part of the material I bought is from the late '60s and early '70s, records that were released when I was 11 or 12, records that I was probably a little too young to acquire," he says.
He agrees that the buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company and adds: "I don't smoke or drink much.
This is my vice."
Twenty-five-year-old Wez, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he meets fit the profile of YouGov.
But he has noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by media enthusiasm, people who have heard that the albums have come back into fashion and who have become in need of buying their old albums back.
On the basis of the discussions I have had, people have usually been rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy back their CDs," he says.
This may explain an increase in the number of vinyl awakenings of a certain age.
But what about the claimed emotional significance of the discs?
In a store like Phonica it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores offer a comforting community for similar types.
According to Wez, some older customers have been particularly injured by the local payment system.
Some vinyl fans can be overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to rely on the permanence of familiar disk covers; objects that bring back memories of teenage days of happiness.
"I think that sometimes it may be about filling a gap or some kind of comfort that the possession of objects creates," Wez says.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe that it is true for many people.
It's an easy way to fill your mind.
"We're like their social workers!" another employee suddenly said from a pile of records.
The April ICM opinion poll revealed that almost 50% of people who had bought vinyl records in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% have no record player to buy vinyl.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look seriously concerned as I browsed through a stack of Bossa Nova collections.
This "prize" aspect of the awakening is something that Jonny, 42, who also works at the Sounds of the Universe (the counter: three middle-aged men).
"Someone came in a while ago and said, 'I don't have a record player, but I want to buy Radiohead's record so we can put it on the shelf," he says.
This is not a large proportion, but it is definitely the case.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
So it's not the parents, it's the younger people, the late teens, who are just getting excited about it.
Fop, which now has almost a whole floor reserved for vinyl, has a much more versatile audience when I arrive.
Seventy-something couples, tourists taking photographs, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the movements mentioned earlier, the speakers of Wild Beast's latest synth and sex-filled pop, and the improvisation jazz - it's great to see a variety of customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it's hard to prove a gnawing psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes looking at various records on sale.
He's doing window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn't make much money, so it's not really an option.
"It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music either on a computer or some other way, but the beauty of vinyl is..." he sighs in love.
"I don't know how to explain... it's really unique."
My last stop is said to have raised a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I'm trying to look like I'm looking at jeans shorts, I'm observing a group of teenage girls who gather around Polaroid cameras for a while before their father and daughter think about buying Crosley's record player.
On the left is a staircase with a wall covered with records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records of any average collection.
No one is looking at them - perhaps because they are just decorations, and some are so high that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's purely "art vinyl".
But considering that even the little attention these objects receive may mean more money for industry and send a few customers to Soho's pits to get more, there is not much to complain about.
It comes as no surprise that the section of the population that is more likely to have more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury items, such as vinyls.
But while my findings suggest that the results of YouGov are accurate at least in Soho's record stores, they do not rule out the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or office.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday mornings lurking around the Berwick Street record stores, browsing records and avoiding the eyes of a creepy, 30-year-old fake TV host looking over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holker is the longest living vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say that Holker has a longer life span than any other vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studied sharks, says that the record is for a female whose age is believed to be between 272 and 512 years and which is five metres long.
The French court rejects the application to terminate the sale of the Jungle refugee camp
The French court has rejected the request of the Calais authorities to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants from the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
In court proceedings this week, the Calais authorities argued that the State should be able to dismantle 72 temporary shops where people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hair cut or sell tea for 50 cents (40 cents), or sell simple food for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Prefect of Calais argued that the places should be dismantled because they represent a non-taxable co-economic co-financing and because they constitute a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups have told the Court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that free meals offered by a state-supported organisation and other groups do not provide enough food for the increasing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free meals for those who need them.
The Court in Lille ruled that there were no legal grounds for eviction of 72 people who run a temporary trade, but said that the concern of the Prefect of Calais "was perfectly understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafés and restaurants played a far greater role than simply feeding people who were 'extremely insecure'.
He said that the facilities provided peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under the threat of demolition was the Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, a non-profit-making camp that provides 200 meals a day, English and French hours and asylum advice to hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
Over 170 000 people have signed a petition to protect children's cafés.
A letter to the Guardian said that closing the café "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old".
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrands, estimated on Friday that the number of people in Jungle's camp has risen to 9,000 people - top reading - since the arrival rate rose sharply during the summer.
Food prices are falling significantly faster in Finland than the EU average
Food prices in Finland are falling sharply to the satisfaction of consumers and to the detriment of producers.
Food prices in Finland have fallen by almost 5% in three years, while the average price in the EU countries fell by 0.9%.
At the same time, in Germany and Sweden, food has become one per cent more expensive.
In the last three years, the price of food has fallen most in Finland from the EU countries with wages similar to Finland.
Only in Britain, the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are based on an article published in the Tieto & Trends blog by Statistics Finland's Development Manager Ilkka Lehtinen.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices that are related to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data are from June this year.
At the beginning of the 2010s, the price of food rose sharply.
In 2013, prices reached a level close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then came a turn of events, after which food has become cheaper year by year.
The price is now borne by Russian bans on food imports, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term," Lehtinen says.
Increased price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
Large retail chains S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For the consumer, price competition has been seen as spectacular advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not a place for cheap food, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland from EU countries with wages similar to Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the control countries had the same VAT rate, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with similar pay levels.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the comparison countries, only Germans and Dutch people would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to get to the old EU countries in terms of food prices, VAT should be reduced to half the average in EU countries and continue to compete on prices," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that his calculations at VAT rates are indicative.
School isn't quite what it used to be.
A person returning to school may find that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a guide according to which all schools in Finland operate.
Schools decide the details themselves, but the plan tells the official goals.
The new guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ in many ways from the old ones.
Among other things, the learning of fiction is abandoned, and instead, the schools begin to practice coding.
Swedish education starts in the sixth grade at the latest, and social studies start already on four.
However, the main change concerns the role of pupils.
It used to be thought that the teacher was teaching the students, but now everyone should be active and learn from one another.
This is how we try to make school more interesting.
The world's longest-lived vertebrate was found - an ice shark can live for up to 400 years
The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) is known as ice sharks, but does not reach sexual maturity until 150 years old.
It can then live another 250 years, reports a new study.
The figures make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it is passed only by an Icelandic clam whose oldest known specimen has been dated to 507.
Greenland sharks swim all over the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are one of the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than males, they can grow to more than five metres.
Since the rate of growth is slow, the results show that only one centimeter a year, adult individuals have been forced to live for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues from the University of Copenhagen examined.
He determined the age of 28 females of adult ice sharks who had been caught in fishermen's fishing gear.
The age of fish was revealed by radiocarbonization of eye lenses.
The average age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, 493 and 502 cent amazoni fins, were found to be around 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have shown that ice sharks only reach maturity at more than four metres, researchers calculated that they are about 150 years old at that time.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann fired nearly 300 sellers are not deducted.
Almost 300 employees are dismissed from Stockmann, a department store company.
Joint ventures in a company in difficulty ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of the negotiations, approximately 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will be made redundant," Stockmann says in his release.
According to this, the number of sellers in the department stores will not be reduced so that customer service will not suffer.
In addition, around 80 employees in support activities are offered new jobs as sellers.
Stockmann's negotiations concerned approximately 3 000 employees.
When they started, the need for deduction was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction in population is intended to achieve annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are due to take place in the course of next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background is Stockmann's difficulties in making the store pay.
Although the Group's adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, trade in department stores continues to lose.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, the Acting CEO of Stockmann, sales in department stores have not reached the company's objectives.
"Unfortunately, staff cuts are necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail's positive operating result in 2018", Veijalainen says in the release.
The second quarter performance improvement was especially due to the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best ever second-quarter turnover and profit.
Lindex' operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
Last year, the Group's operating result for the entire Stockmann Group was 4,1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperature less than 20 degrees in the whole country
The low-pressure center on the north of Finland keeps the weather rainy on Friday," says HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
There are also rain showers in the central part of the country, but southwards are pouty.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as mercury remains below 20 degrees Celsius throughout the country.
In the rainy areas of the north, we'll stay at 10-15 degrees.
The Kenyan athletic team is shaken by the doping scandal - a strange explanation for the coach's stunt
Kenyan athletic coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it turned out that Anzrah was an athlete of the national team in the doping test.
The AP reported that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is the 800 - meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of Kenya's national team team, reported that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had taken the surprise test as Rotichina.
Doping officers came by to inform the Anzrah authorities.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because he "did his crime against the Kenyan national team."
He performed as an athlete, gave me a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour," says Kip Vähte, Chairman of the Kenya Olympic Committee, who thundered at Reuters News Office.
Olympic athletics starts on Friday, and Rotich is due to run right then and then.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich was ranked fourth in the World Cup last year and has a number of Rio winners in advance.
According to Reuters, a source within the Kenyan athletic team claimed that Anzrah was using an athlete's accreditation card only to get free meals in the race village.
When the antidoping officers met him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officers because he was afraid he would be exposed," said the source.
Where is everybody?
Rio Sports Stadium rubbers its emptiness
Where the hell is everybody?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium watching athletics.
On Friday in Rio, a battle began over the medals of athletics, but the world's top individuals were allowed to present their skills to a perplexingly empty audience.
The Rio organizers reported on Friday that only 58 percent of the first day's morning tickets and 65 percent of the evening tickets have been sold.
Four years ago, there was another one in London, where the stadium was bulging about cheering people.
The tickets to the finals have already been sold out in Rio.
The disappearance of the Rio Olympic Games has attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, thousands of empty benches have appeared in the stands of rugby, canoeing and riding.
When Brazil's medal wishes for Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the audience were full.
After the Brazilian duo, Holland played against Russia, and only about 30 percent of the 12,000 people in the stands were full.
The bad business is explained at least by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with financial difficulties, is far from being a European and Asian tourist race, and many of the Olympic sports are strange to the Brazilians used to football.
True, even Brazil's football team's first match could not fill the football stadium.
Mario Andrada, the organiser's spokesman, said this weekend that 82% of the tickets had been sold at that time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million endings left to sell," said Andrada, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets sold at the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, even though the tickets cost almost half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around EUR 9 to over EUR 1 000 at the opening.
More than half the tickets cost less than EUR 16.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty spaces, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed because the organisers need money and try to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, however, the organisers have given 240 000 tickets to schoolchildren in the country for less well-known species such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty seats at the Rio Stadium this morning.
Not even a beach volleyball on Copacaba sand has been of interest to the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London 2012.
There were plenty of people in the gallery.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation by new means.
The Foundation, established last year, acquires ecologically important natural areas.
After that, private, companies and entities may use money to redeem holders' rights to land.
The Foundation has acquired its first land area in Lapland.
The land is virtually divided into parcels that the interested parties can acquire in return for the payment of the right to wear.
The holder will have a veto in his 187-square block, which in practice means that not every holder will need approval if the use of the land is to be changed.
Elf rights can also be acquired for several sections.
Acquiring a right of control is something concrete that can be left as an inheritance or a gift.
You don't have to carry banners or chain yourself somewhere to protect nature," says Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired the right of control for his company.
The holder of the management right receives precise location information from his block, which allows for a visit to the block, for example.
On the Foundation's website, the names of holders of rights are displayed on the same map where the land block data can be found.
Leviathan sees its nature conservation acquisition as a risk only that the Foundation's activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been founded as a foundation of general interest with the aim of promoting the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the Foundation would operate in some unethical or commercial way, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea behind the Helsinki Foundation's Haltija project is to protect nature areas so that they can be undisturbed and undisturbed.
The Foundation acquires land either by buying or by making a donation.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of holders' rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims beyond Finland's borders and plans to purchase land in Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in the pop-up forest at Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
The bike thieves torment Turkey the most from the big cities - see the situation in your municipality
Bicycle thieves torment Turkey most of all from Finland's major cities.
This year more wheels have been stolen in proportion to the population than in nine other major cities.
On the basis of the bike thefts reported to the police, Helsingin Sanomat explained to the police how many bicycles and parts of them have been stolen in the ten largest cities in January to August of this year, calculated per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti took the lead.
According to police records, four to five bike thefts occurred per 1,000 inhabitants.
On the other hand, in Espoo and Kouvola, police were only notified of about two bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
It's a big difference.
"In other cities there are double the number of thefts relative to the number of inhabitants," says police inspector Tommi Reen of the Police Department.
The Turku police wonder why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
"The frequency of theft can be affected by how much people ride bikes in the city and how many wheels there are at all," says Sergeant Teemu Äkäs.
Tommi Reen of the Police Department considers it quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will take the lead in comparison.
The number of bike thefts goes largely according to which are the study and cycling cities.
Turku has a dense centre, short distances and lots of spins available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city, where city centres are distant from each other and bicycles are not necessarily the primary means of transport," Reen says.
In all Finland, slightly fewer bike thefts have become known to the police in January to August than in the corresponding period last year.
But there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police are aware of just over 20 000 bike thefts a year.
It means 50-60 fillers every day and approximately 4,000 wheels a year in Helsinki alone.
"They're large amounts," Reen says.
In fact, thieves take more wheels, for only a few of the victims report theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report bike theft, even if fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police will be solved.
Typical solved bike theft is one where the police are immediately informed of the theft and the thief is caught freshly.
"Even cases can be solved during other investigations, when, for example, stolen wheels may be found in a drug-related apartment," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught every week in connection with an act or police investigation," says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bikes are stolen from bike racks, inner yards, warehouses and cellars, for example, where they are usually kept.
As in previous years, Jopos are the ones most stolen from individual cycles.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves take the bike for their short - term use, for example, but a large proportion of stolen wheels end up on the market, for example, online.
They remain on the domestic market.
"At least the police have not known that stolen bikes are going abroad," Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen wheels are ordinary Finns.
Some people probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about that.
The buyer of the used wheel must be vigilant, as he may be guilty of a hidden crime or violation.
"The alarm bells should ring if a good-quality bike is sold at a very low price," Reen says.
Severi Hirvi, a special library official, carries his colorful Nopsa every day during his working day to the shelters of the Kallio Library in Helsinki.
He's had five wheels, but none has been stolen," says Hirvi. "No, he's never been taken, he's had a good monk."
"Maybe this isn't so attractive to thieves, it doesn't necessarily have hipster value," says the Helsinki-based Hirvi.
Siiri Valve, who was in a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked her bike with a small U-lock.
Now the bike snorted against the wall of the kiosk, but usually Valve locks his bike on something solid, such as a bike rack.
"It's going to be a lot of thought, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," says a student in Helsinki about his white bicycle, whose frame alone cost about 500 euros.
"All the time you hear from your friends that bikes have been taken away."
"For the most part, bad bikes, such snot-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho."
Valvee himself was stolen a bike from the yard of the housing company a year ago.
Although the bike had not been locked up, so Valve was expecting it to be taken.
Under 15 years of age to be held accountable for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer whales familiar from the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from entering a criminal cycle.
Initially, the experiment will apply to people under the age of 15 who are now deprived of criminal liability.
The peer jury is missing from the first juvenile offense.
The idea is that the peer jury will discuss what happened with the perpetrator and impose a sanction.
A week later, the perpetrator can join the peer jury himself to make up for his actions.
For example, there may be a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Laitio, Director of Youth Administration, says that the model is not tight.
We have other compromise models which are used side by side.
"Every young person's actions are directed in a more responsible direction so that everything does not get ruined by his first mistake," Laitio says.
The peer jury has been modelled on the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that a young person, after his first crime, does not face an adult panel but reflects what happened with people about the same age.
We've tried the model once.
Iikka Lovio, the service designer of Palmu, who followed the experiment, says that it was an assault that was successfully solved.
The first crimes, especially those under the age of 15, may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It has been a message that you continue along the path of your choice," says Lovio.
The peer jury is part of the Helsinki project of immigrant youth based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Mr Lovio stresses that new approaches are being offered to all those who need it, not just to young immigrants.
More than 70 Republicans want the party to stop funding Trump's campaign.
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported in the U.S. newspaper Politico, who had received a draft of it.
According to the paper, the open letter is addressed to the President of the National Republican Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money to be channelled to Congressional elections instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump and his indifference, incompetence and record displeasure are threatening to bring a wave of voices to democracy in these elections," says Politico.
Only the immediate allocation of all possible funds to Congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning with Trump-crowned anchor around their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential election are reduced day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent in the course of next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organisers of the letter is Andrew Weinstein, a Republican who is prominently opposed to Trump.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress" and that it is not a matter of supporting anyone.
The letter lists many of Donald Trump's actions, which are believed to have injured millions of voters.
Moreover, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for families with children in the United States
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton explained the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I'm running for president to make the American economy go well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is running for president so that the economy can go well for him and his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be partly financed by tax increases on the part of the rich, partly through private money.
The construction programme is a handhold for American workers who are suffering from the relocation of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme the largest investment in high-paid jobs after World War II.
We're a builder's people, we have to go back and build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday Clinton also promised to facilitate the situation of working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders anyway, pointing out that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it has to pay the starting tax," Clinton said.
Today he opposes the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he once supported.
"As President, I am opposed to any trade agreement that works against employees or wages," Clinton promised.
According to speculations published by The Washington Post before Clinton's speech, Clinton was going to criticize the financial programme announced by Republican Donald Trump on Monday for "only favoring millionaires like this one".
The reduction proposed by Trump in corporate taxes has previously been called 'Trump's loophole' by Clinton.
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded listeners of small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has failed to pay, and of the clothes Trump himself produces in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start by making his own products in America," Clinton spiked.
These are the ratings of Rio: The competitions have not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile app is interesting
Sports competitions are usually shown in TV viewer statistics as sharp peaks.
The Rio Olympics have so far not reached a huge number of spectators.
At a time the competitions have glued 12 per cent of the population to the squares: at the same time, 615 000 viewers from Yle's Olympic Channel TV2 followed the swimming on Tuesday night.
For comparison: the European Championships in athletics one month ago received almost 800 000 admissions at a time, while the European Championships in football received well over one million.
The most interesting of the Olympic sports has so far been Sunday night cycling and the fifth day of the race, which both reached the Olympic channel at a time of almost half a million spectators.
Panu Pokkinen, the general sports manager, is pleased with the ratings and reminds us that for the first time the viewers will be divided into several different instruments at the Rio Olympics.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympic Games from Rio Arena.
We welcome the fact that a large proportion of television viewers choose the Olympic Games at all.
Even on TV, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Olympic Games in Rio are the first sporting events to which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When broadcast 24 hours a day, from 20,000 to 500 000 viewers all the time, that is a good basis.
The ratings are lower than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large proportion of Rio's competitions come in Finland during the night.
Another reason for the weak interest - if anyone thinks it is lame - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the start, the interest would have bounced up with it.
In addition, athletics is just beginning, as are other species of Finnish interest: sailing and riding.
According to Pokkinen, the initial ratings have been close to what was expected.
When the athletics begin, the ratings explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the games, which in the first days of the Games became the most downloaded free app in Finland at Apple App Store.
By Monday, the app was loaded 150,000 times.
I'm guessing we're already going around 200,000 downloads.
"We won't get the ratings for the network until later," says Pokkinen.
Rio Arena hasn't worked as well as any of the users.
Pokkinen says feedback has come and the faults have been corrected.
The use of Rio Arena has been accompanied by delays and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
The applications have provided updated versions that should correct the errors.
The Olympic Games in Rio are seen on Yle's channels and in the arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
There are some species that can be monitored from Yle Fem, and on radio Yle Speech broadcasts the games daily.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborious for Yle, but also the last to be followed only by Yle's channels.
Since 2018, Olympic sports are visible on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, which has a depth of 95,3 metres on the Ristinselkä.
It might be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technical diving instructor, found about 20 square meters of pressure on the Risselkä, the bottom of which was shown to be 104 meters deep by the diving computer.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried to strengthen the observation in vain by sonaring.
The method may not find a small depth of 100 meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95,3 metres.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi go over 80 metres.
They haven't been studied as closely as Päijänne.
Especially the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully charted.
"There might well be unknown depths," Kannela says.
If the deepest lake is defined by means of the middle depth, it is Great Lake Juka, 23 meters.
Viewed in this way, Päijänne does not reach the top ten and Suvasvesi is even further from the tip.
Correction August 12th at 2:29 p.m.: Corrected last paragraph, where the deepest lakes in the middle depth were wrong.
Adolescent of the tax advantage: Tax on pensioners is still more strained
The taxation of pensioners is still more intense than that of employees.
According to Ihalainen, the problem arose in the run-up to parliamentary elections and the taxation of pensioners was promised equal treatment with employees.
This is not included in the Board's proposal.
We believe that this should definitely be the case.
The promises made should be followed after the election," he says to the West Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received reductions in their income, which reduced taxation.
The matter was heated up in Parliament by representatives of the opposition who grilled Alexander Stubb, then Minister for Finance, for election promises.
Buying power is secure, it doesn't grow
According to Ihalainen, the policy presented by Minister of Finance, Mr Petteri Orpo, on tax reductions is mainly about safeguarding and increasing purchasing power, as next year wages will not be raised.
He says that the tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with Prime Minister Juha Sipilä's messages and Orpo's desire to respect the hard-made competitiveness pact.
He says sticking to a contract is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government term.
It has been done by the social partners, so it should not be destroyed by questioning.
It is necessary because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people's own faith in the future.
Long-term unemployment in a row
The admirer appeals to the government to tackle long-term unemployment in the budget cycle, at least to halt its growth.
In June, the number of long-term unemployed persons was around 17,000 higher than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's goal of raising the employment rate to 72% will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of persistent unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: There are no known Finnish casualties in Thailand's attacks
At least four people died in the bombings in Thailand last night and last night in Finland.
The embassy urges the Finns in the country to pay attention and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finnish tourists to cancel their trip to Thailand due to explosions, but it is worth following the embassy's instructions on caution," Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish travel season in Thailand dates back to the turn of the year.
The majority of tourists from Thailand come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook since the bombings.
The embassy has tried to reach out to Finns in Hua Hin in particular to learn about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be fine," Westphalen says.
No information on the author
Westphalen says there's no record of the attacker yet.
The Ambassador believes that the events may be related to the political unrest in the divided society of Thailand and the referendum last week on the constitution drawn up by the military junta.
The law was passed by referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people in the country were arrested who expressed their opposition to the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, the ethnic-national conflict surrounding the Muslim population is also smouldering," says Westphalen.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today is a big, local holiday in Bangkok," Westphalen says.
He says the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks should affect the day's course so that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai Police: Attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism has also been ruled out, according to the Thai police news agency AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died in 24 hours when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as the tourist - favored Phuket and Hua Hin.
In a tourist destination popular with Finns, four bombs were detonated in the night at the holiday island Phuket, says Bangkok Post.
According to current information, they did not require any casualties.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the newspaper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where, according to the newspaper, one person was injured.
In the popular tourist destination Hua Hin, a total of four bombs have exploded yesterday and today, according to local authorities.
In both double bombings, at least one was killed.
In addition, in South Thailand, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Than and in the city of Trang.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it is used to travel to Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao resort islands.
The attacker is unknown
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the military junta in Thailand, the attacker is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not stir people up to panic any more," he said to the journalists.
According to Vice-President of Security Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least the attacks by Hua Hin and Trang are linked.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators were meant to destroy the country's tourism because all the attacks took place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy urges Finns in the country to pay attention and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finns to cancel their trip to Thailand because of explosions, but it is worth following the instructions of the Great Fleece for caution," Westphalen says.
Vulnerable Europeans
So far, very little is known about the attacks that took place in Finland during the night and about the victims.
We've had a little more time to get some information about last night's attack on Hua Hin.
A local woman died and more than 20 others were wounded, including at least nine foreign tourists.
The wounded include at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
In Hua Hin's second attack, at least three people were injured.
Two bombs exploded near a bell tower known as a tourist attraction.
Thai PBS reports that the police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where they believe they have found another bomb.
According to the governor of the province, Surat Than's bomb was hidden in a flowerbed.
A municipal employee died in the attack.
There's at least one wounded.
The chief of police interviewed by CNN reports that two bombs were also used in the attack on Surat Than, which exploded every half hour or so.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
The U.S. Party won the women's four-game.
The United States of America Alexandra Raisman was the second point at 60.098 and the Russian Alija Mustafina was the third with 58,665 points.
Biles, 18, still chasing stand championships at the Rio Games with permanto, jump and boom.
Biles has been in control of women's gymnast for the past few years.
He has eight personal world championships in the last three seasons.
He has won the four-game and permanon championships three times in a row and the boom last year and the other year.
In the U.S. team, the Party has achieved two team championships.
We've got smaller World Cup medals at the Party. They've got jumps and booms.
Finnish entrepreneur in Thailand: "Isku has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand and a children's play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I don't think there will be anything more remarkable about this, says Huovila, who has worked for some twenty years as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many of the tragedies that have hit Thailand nearby.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then avian influenza, and last year there was a bombing in Bangkok.
If these past ones haven't driven out the tourists, I don't think this has.
The office of the Huvilala company is located a few hundred meters from the site of the explosion.
The blanket heard about the attack from his own employee.
The employee called at about nine o'clock at the local time and said you shouldn't come to the office.
The Huvila says that both the promenade and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning as a result of the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been set for the Queen's birthday," Huovila says and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
On Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open at about 10 o'clock local time.
A lot of people on the beach hadn't even heard of the attacks.
At half past three o'clock in the Thai time at Patong traffic had normalized and a large part of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, says the Huovila who visited the scene.
Later, this car was seen in the Crown of Jouxholmintie.
When the police got there, the car was set on fire.
The patrol spotted two men who fit the description, hiding in a nearby tree.
The other man was immediately apprehended.
The other one ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft, theft and gross damage to the motor vehicle.
The police thank those who gave us the clues.
Research Director on Russian leadership changes: Clear relocation
On Friday, the highest leadership change was made in Russia for years when President Vladimir Putin fired Chief Sergei Ivanov of his administration.
Ivanov's successor is Anton Vaino, 44 years old from Estonia.
He's an ex-diplomatic. He's the number two man in Ivanov.
The fabric stream says that the reason why Ivanov was fired could be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from building up too much power.
He adds that the recycling of management tasks is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from building up a power independent of the President.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been in trouble with other leaders or screwed up.
Dropping station in Ivanovville
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, will be transferred to special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
On a tape from the state media, Putin called the transformation into a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov had himself asked for a transfer to another post and proposed that Persecution be replaced, Russia Today said.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view it is a clear drop in the station.
Environmental and transport issues in Russia are not very high in order of importance.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the height of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the Security Council of the President.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet era.
He was considered a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, such as governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnönniemi of the Finnish Institute of Foreign Policy says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place is Putin's changing his immediate circle to a younger one.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield when retreating in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield when they fled to the city of Jarabulus to avoid targeting them," said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians had been placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters took over about 90% of the important city of Manbiji for ISIS.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at that time.
Corrected by 7:30 a.m.: Earlier we misread that civilians were fleeing the city, actually Isis fighters kidnapped civilians when they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior's Publicity Policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on public access to documents is illegal, says Professor Tomi Voutilainen of the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutilainen tells STT that access to documents cannot be based on the authority's own policies but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants to Ilta-Sanom at the Home Secretary's events.
The Minister justified the decision on the basis of instructions from the Government Office and the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting file.
The Minister's Communications Director tells STT that there is a need to reform practices in the Ministry.
Usai Bolt's last Olympic show begins in Rio
Like the last few years, Bolt's been running against time in high school.
He insulted his back thighs from the early days and had to skip Jamaica's Olympic Qualities.
This hasn't been a perfect preparation, but I'm in much better shape.
I've been practicing well, and that's the key, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included samba dancers and journalists turned into fans.
Porina Bolt emphasizes that the Jamaican star has risen in an era when athletics have struggled with doping scandals and slipping interest.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came from Athens in 2004, when he was eliminated in the first 200 metres at 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that was slowed down by injuries and loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at a hundred metres, with which he crushed the world record and the confidence of his competitors despite the final celebrations of 9,69 years.
It's harder than this.
A year later, at the Berlin World Cup, Bolt reached his career at a point of law with a clock.
The world record in Berlin at 9.58 a hundred meters and 19.19 a 200 is still valid.
In Rio Bolt has announced that he is pursuing a world record of 200 metres and 19 seconds below, but no one believes in its creation except Bolt himself.
In 100 Bolt's challenge is the Olympic winner Justin Gatlin of the 100th Olympic Games in Athens 2004.
Last year at the Beijing World Cup, Bolt defeated the American in just one hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost a single time in the finals of the prize contests if he has made his way.
In Daegu 2011 the $100 World Cup final was missed by Bolt due to fraud.
Bolt turns 30 in over a week.
He's an old man in a young man's sport, and the Rio Games are his last Olympic Games.
Bolt has set next year's World Cup in London as the final finish line for his career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the others.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it," Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Reveals from Rio: two athletes suspected of drug abuse
According to Xinhua, China's state news agency, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi's doping sample found traces of prohibited substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekov is also suspected of a drug abuse.
In addition, a Kenyan athletic coach was sent to his home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of an athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given me a drug sample with signs of epo-hormones.
He was ranked fourth in Rio in the women's 100-meter butterfly swim.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has taken his case of doping to the International Court of Appeal for Sport (CAS).
Xinhua reports that a sample of Xinyi given on Sunday would have shown signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
There have also been other suspicions of doping in Rio.
The BBC reports that Bulgarian female obstacle runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of epo hormone.
Kenya, on the other hand, has sent an athletic coach home from Rio for a drug abuse.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee KOK reported that the Kenian coach had pretended to be an athlete in a test situation and had given a doping sample for this.
According to the media, this is John Anzrah, a Kenian express coach.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the race pass of the 800 - meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
There's no stopping Phelps - historical gold came in the act style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swam 200 metres in a blend of his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to achieve Olympic gold of the same species in the fourth consecutive race.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino was ranked second in confusion before China's Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, and the BBC Olympic swim commentator Helen Skelton laughs at an Iltalehti quick interview.
The article about Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read on the evening magazine website this week.
Next to the commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't have much stress if social media or the British press have a little noise about his revealing and special outfits.
Television is a visual media, he emphasizes.
Skelton is wearing high heels shoes and a short dress with certainly at least enough exposure - to the eyes of at least many conservative British viewers.
However, there are no steps backwards.
It's important to look good, and small things are just funny.
I'm sure Skelton wants to scare you and maybe even startle you, but he insists that he doesn't want to play the lead.
It's not about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus must be on the athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the fuss has reached Finland?
I can't, but anything that pays attention to how hard these swimmers work and how big sacrifices they make is okay to me, Skelton grins.
You know what?
It's a fuss about nothing if it comes from dressing (the host).
I'm a little amused if someone's radar's been hit by something like this.
Rio Police made two arrests for suspicion of terror.
On Thursday, the Rio police announced that they had arrested two people for suspected terrorism.
The police made arrests in connection with the security oversight of the games.
In the same connection, the police made five other arrests and questioned two persons prior to their release.
All suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news site, persons arrested for terrorism belong to the same group as those arrested by the police in July.
Arrested people are believed to have ties to the Isis organization.
The arrests were reportedly inciting violence in social media.
Messages to encourage violence had been disseminated in the popular WhatsApp service.
85,000 police officers are responsible for the security of the Rio Games.
The police blew up a suspicious package in Rio.
Spain and Nigeria were forced to start their first round of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty hangar on Thursday.
The police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and shut the place down.
The police let the crowd in after the package was blown up in a controlled manner.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics when the police have completed a controlled explosion mission.
The police shut down the arena because of the suspicious package they found there.
The crowd got in after the police had controlled the explosion of the package.
The audience did not reach the audience by the beginning of the game because the police closed the arena for a while because of the suspicious package found in the hall.
The police blew up the package and only let the crowd into the hangar after that.
The drink woke up the team of Spain, which had been a sleepy start to the games.
With two defeats, Spain, which started the race, won Nigeria with 96-87 points.
In the last two races Spain reached silver.
For the third time ever during the Rio Summer Games, police carried out a controlled blasting mission.
Last time I checked, the police had to blow up a suspicious discovery in the vicinity of a road biking goal last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their first round of the Rio basketball tournament in front of empty stands.
Argentinian dame pushed Petäjä-Siren - Finnish thought about protest
Wind Petäjä-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
Wind Petäjä-Siren had a rough time on Thursday.
Argentinian dame kicked Wind Petäjä-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening of the women's surfing day.
The winds were clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the crime.
He got stuck in a car crash, and the others ran away, said Joakim Wilenius, Finland's head coach.
The athlete considered protest for a long time.
It was not worth doing because, according to the Olympic rules, it would have been pointless.
I should have fallen into the water to be compensated," said Petäjä-Siren.
The Finnish man was hanging on his board until the end because he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
The Finnishman was left in 27 with the crash.
In the overall situation, London's 2012 Olympic Silver Medal is the eighth.
The accident didn't have much to do with the accident.
Friday's a big day when we're racing 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that, according to science, prolong age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring more years into a person's life.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect a person's health so that his or her life is prolonged.
On the other hand, sometimes things that a person himself cannot control can bring him additional years.
These include a tendency to medium-body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can extend your age.
You don't have to spend a lot of time getting a can of milk.
A number of studies have been carried out to find out the secret of the long term.
Medical Daily presented seven of the most bizarre research results.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking Beer and Coffee
Coffee consumption has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
Harvard University's study found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to "a reduced risk of death", especially with regard to neurological or cardiac diseases.
Again, alcohol is spoken for by studies that suggest that moderate consumption - from one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular flossing can extend a person's life for more than six years, says one study.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents gum infections.
They, on the other hand, can help to break out other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway found out how laughing affected a person's life span.
The seven-year project monitored over 54 000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to live when the experiment ended.
Sex, when the protection against sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, according to many studies, is good for health.
In addition, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, having sex as such is not enough.
For a person to have more years in his life, he should also have an orgasm.
Of course, physical activity will bring more years, it will not be disputed.
However, reaching a long age does not require absolute levity.
In fact, a study at Oxford University found lower cholesterol levels in women with large buttocks.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality.
Whether it's an athlete or an Oscar-winning actor who got to the medalists at the Olympics, he's more likely to live beyond the usual bungee.
A lot of research has been trying to find the reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring him further years of life.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that long life is due to a person's social status - which, for its part, makes it possible to seek recognition such as the Nobel Prize.
A survey of shopping behaviour among people over 65 found that the person who shopped daily was likely to be less likely to be older than those who shop.
This is because running in concrete shops reduces loneliness.
Again, it has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may lead to early death.
So put your credit card down - online shopping does not therefore have the same effect.
A drunk driver in a drunk-in-the-drunk accident went off into a truck.
On Friday night a serious truck and passenger car nose accident took place in Koskö, Southwest Finland.
The accident took place at Kosk, Koskuntien and Sorvastontie midway on Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car that arrived had drifted into the same lane, hitting the right angle of the truck.
After the crash, the truck was left in its lane, but it caught fire.
The driver managed to put the fire out himself.
The passenger car went off into the ditch and from there over the ditch to its roof.
The woman who was born in 1972 who carried a passenger car was squeezed in her car.
The Rescue Department removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to Turku University Hospital for treatment.
The result of the female blow test was 2.02 per mil.
He's a suspect in a serious DUI.
The mail sent me some loose candy to the wrong town.
Salon K-Citymarket's loose candy selection was defective because the mail had accidentally delivered part of the load to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was on Thursday buying locusts at the Salon K-Citymarket when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in bulk confectionery because Posti delivered our load to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when Posti can deliver the load!
So unless there's traffic on the lawn, the sign said.
The store's foxy sign is related to Posti's expansion of its services to lawnmowers last spring.
Weed cutting is in Posti's supply until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing and decided to share it in social media.
The popularity of the update struck me with a shock.
The media have been calling all the time, and the attention that this issue has attracted is incredible, Eltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia's update had over 700 splits on Facebook.
Elly was able to grab her own favorites in a bag of candy, even though a few laers were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who is responsible for the business of the transport services of Posti's Enterprises, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanom.
The background is that three of the five pallets strayed yesterday to the wrong place (Sinäjoki) and we no longer left for part delivery (Saloon) by three, but only today we took five pallets, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
The first news was from the evening Sanomat.
Teija Eltia was not indignant about the sign because she found all her favorites in the selection.
Loss of weight! 30 kg lighter Lotta Backlund released a picture of her change
The comedian producer has thinned tens of kilos since the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of kilos as a result of a change in life.
Lotta shared a pair of pictures on Friday for her change in Instagram.
In the spring Lotta was on a fitness course and was aiming for normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund started her weight loss work as early as 2009.
He has made a comprehensive lifestyle change and gradually lost about 30 pounds.
On Friday Backlund released a pair of pictures on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed in appearance over the years.
The backlund before and after pair has collected several praiseworthy comments from the co-suppliers.
You're gorgeous.
The same way we're going, motivation's hard!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the "Do It Now" project.
Your pictures give me a lot of strength and enthusiasm when you go on the same journey," says another.
In the spring Lotta dropped her last kilos on the "Let's do it now" project.
At that time he told the Iltalehti that he wanted finally to reach the normal weight, which was then 10 kilos.
In the course of three months of rehab, five kilos were finally dropped.
The family of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Remembering the victim for the benefit of police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim will be remembered not by flowers and petitions but by a donation for police dog work.
Sipoo Veterinarian Station has published a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim's family's wish for donations for the benefit of police dogs.
The report states that the victim had worked as a substitute at Sipoo Veterinarian Station and had also completed her nursing training there.
The veterinarian's office remembers her with words that touch her.
Joyful, smart, humorous, and unafraid of work.
Good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update states that the entire donation money goes to police dogs, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisa woman was murdered in her own backyard in Loviisa Koskenkylä.
The woman's neighbors have said to the Evening Journal that the victim was very animal lover.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and roosters.
A 27-year-old man suspected of murder didn't know a woman and they had no connection.
The killer was tracked by a police dog named Börje, who was wounded in a life-threatening situation.
Börje, however, survived and is recovering.
The District Court passed judgment on the violation of the Equality Act on Post.
The Post had no right to suspend the salary of the employee who refused to familiarise the temporary worker, estimates the District Court of Kanta-Häme in its judgment.
The District Court obliged Post to pay the employee most of the wages withheld and EUR 2 000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Post could only have withheld part of the trainee's salary, which corresponded to the share of familiarisation in the entire day's work.
According to the District Court, the worker had been put at a disadvantage on the basis of his trade union activities in breach of the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with the PAU's Association Decision on the prohibition of introduction.
During last November's postal strike, the PAU decided not to familiarise Post employees with temporary workers who break the strike.
The People's News first told us about it.
Turkey's return to the path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights development, written by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centralist) and Minister of Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (ps.) in their reply to the Journalist Federation.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk) and Minister of Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In a letter earlier, the Journalist Association asked Sipilä and Soin to express their concerns in favour of freedom of expression and press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland has repeatedly brought to Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and expression.
Putin fired the head of his administration... from the Estonian-speaking Persecution.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed Sergey Ivanov, Head of the Presidential Administration, says the Kremlin.
The Soviet-Estonia Communist leader Karl Vaino's grandson Anton Vaino will be attending.
The persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has been Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, says Interfax news agency.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, will be transferred to special environmental and transport tasks according to the Kremlin's announcement.
According to Putin, Ivanov had himself asked for a transfer and proposed Vasio to replace him," says Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era in the KGB espionage.
Many considered Ivanov a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed President in 2011 before Putin was re-elected in 2012.
The BBC's massive acquisition of ManU's gaming ban is not seen in the opening of the Champions League.
The world record man for football transfers will not be seen in the field when England's Champion League kicks off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban on gambling followed him to England.
The huge purchase of Manchester United, Paul Pogba, is sidelined as ManU opens its league season on Sunday against Bournemouth, reported the BBC on Friday.
According to the British media, ManU paid EUR 105 million to Juventus, an Italian club in Pogba.
However, the English Football Federation FA keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was burdened by a ban on Juventus.
He received two warnings from last season's Italian cup, and it becomes a one-game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogban's next seam to play is the league's second round of August 19, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, grandeur is a virtue
The exact criteria and ambitious visions of entertainment have established Flow Festival's position as an internationally respected event starred by world-class artists.
The Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festorists have typically expressed themselves in a distinctive dress.
One of the main stage artists this year is punk-legenda Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is stared with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to have just a main stage and a beer tent," says the artistic director of the event Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival in Suvilahti, Helsinki, this weekend has grown from a small block festival to an event of tens of thousands of visitors.
The simple question behind success is: What kind of event would those who did it want to go to?
It's quite unusual to think this way in the production of events.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities," says Tuomas Kallio, Artistic Director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow was going to sell out again this year.
The aim has been to increase the number of visitors to last year's 70 000 by 5,000.
The festival will also see a number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists this year.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because something must be done to finance it in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle being steered on huge routes.
We don't want that.
Over the past 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been expanded to include 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurant points and drinks bars.
In addition to the main stage and the smaller stage, this year's venue is a tent for 15,000 people.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a little grandiose, but at the same time, we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If you lose it, this isn't our thing anymore.
The biggest joy and reward for the work done is that even great visions are now possible in practice.
In the early years of the event, in the mid-2000s, the operations were highly dependent on the City of Helsinki's support of around EUR 20 000.
Last year, the company running Flow had a turnover of approximately EUR 6 million.
It can be used to produce "creative things" such as the construction of that 73-meter-wide tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves in a distinctive dress.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event is not deliberately profiled as a particularly fashionable event.
Above all, we want to distinguish between content and content.
Still, fashion phenomena are also suitable for Flow's values: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment," says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is a punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer in the festival that combines indierock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time we see this at a gig in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
It's not just what's on the commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good and he's been doing some damn good gigs in recent years.
The bombs of Thailand's tourist paradise were hidden in flower pots - tourists fled in terror
On Thursday night, two bombs exploded at Hua Hin.
At least one local woman died in the attack and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flowerpot and blown up with cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreign.
They were blown up at the same time that tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, according to police representative Samoer Yoosumra CNN.
Since 1989, Edwin Wiek, a wildlife protector living in Asia, tweeted a talkative picture of the attacks.
If the TV doesn't show up properly, you can watch it right here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran up against me and said the bomb had exploded at the bars.
It happened in one of the biggest bars, told Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs went off in Surat Than.
At least one of them died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after this, two bombs exploded on Phuket Island, which was favored by the Finns.
No one's known to have died.
At the same time, there was another double bomb attack in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in Trang City.
The police reportedly found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely to be rebel forces behind the bombings who are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, police have recently taken up the activities of criminal organisations involved in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new stand-by forces goes to battle first in a war situation
In an acute war situation, military troops are commanded to engage in combat tasks only after several months of swearing a military oath, reports the Central Finn.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, the Chief of Training of the Defence Forces interviewed by the magazine, for example, of those who serve for 5.5 months in a war situation, only those who are in the final stages of their training are eligible for battle.
According to the Head of Training, the first task is to appoint reserve members of the emergency teams.
No conscript or reservist is ordered for a mission that has not received the required training," says Sonninen.
Earlier in the summer, it became apparent that the Defence Forces will start training the armed forces in the immediate capability units starting next year.
If necessary, units may be used for military operations already during military training.
Pamela Tola got the giant damages for the mold house.
The actor Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a heavy dispute over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of a two-storey separate house had been EUR 330 000.
After the transaction, however, the house revealed a serious moisture problem that caused a microbial growth that was harmful to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in its condition in 2014.
The sales price had dropped to EUR 132 000, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to as much as EUR 198 000.
The couple took the case to court and there demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case at both the District Court and the Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal ruled on Wednesday.
It upheld the judgment of the District Court which ordered the seller to pay Tola and Waroma EUR 150 000 for the price reduction.
In addition, the seller has to pay a total of EUR 47 344 for the couple's costs of legal proceedings and settlements.
The right moderated the price reduction slightly because some of the need to repair the dwelling had already been known to buyers at the time of the sale of the dwelling.
However, according to the Court of Justice, the building defects that appeared were substantially more serious than what had been presented.
Tola was looking for a home in good condition.
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically sought a home in good condition because they did not want to go to repairs.
He had been given the impression that the building was renovated and in good condition and that there was no harm to the elements mentioned in the fitness check report.
The fitness inspection report mentioned ventilation in terms of risks and inaccuracies and the lack of adequate management of rain and melting water flowing along the rock surface.
However, it did not appear from the discussions that this was an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma were left under the impression that rainwaters from the rock might have to be controlled a little over the next few years.
The transaction took place in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became apparent that the moisture problems in the dwelling were much more serious than thought.
Inspections in 2012 and 2013 revealed microbial growth in the building, which, according to the Witnesses, was due both to the rainwaters of the rock and to the capillary humidity.
On the west side of the house, the inspector estimated that the air contaminated by microbes could also reach the interior via the porch.
Healthy risk, mold or yeast above limit values were found in brush samples in the home care room, basement staircase, living room window-locker and basement washroom.
The terraces were built without permission
There was also a dispute over whether the apartment had been extended in violation of the building permit.
The court ruled that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo to change the dwelling against the permit prior to the transaction.
The terraces, among other things, were built, even though there were no proper permits yet.
Home problems, however, were a key issue in court.
According to the Court, the purchasers could assume from the seller that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for extensive repairs in the near future.
In the view of the Court of Justice, Tola and Waroma had no particular reason to carry out a wider inspection than usual.
Buyers have not failed to report on their obligation to do so, the Court of Justice states in its judgment.
Creepy Archive Discovery: Hundreds of thousands of women wanted to have children for Nazis - also Finns in the register
Journalist Christopher Andersson writes in his recent article by Dagens Nyheter, how the National Archives of Maryland in the United States have recorded documents on microfilms of a total of 218 500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
The majority of women are German, but they are also American, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danes, 86 Norwegians, 14 Finns and 31 Swedish women were wanted as Nazi brides.
The documents and registration cards come from the National Race Agency in Nazi Germany.
The race agency was under the command of SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true even more for women who had to be able to bear more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynaecological studies were conducted in women to investigate this.
The Racial Authority investigated women's backgrounds by, among other things, studying church books.
The purpose was to make sure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and give the race agency a handwritten biography and good recommendations from their loved ones.
The Racial Authority wanted guarantees that women were "child lovers", "savers", and "good National Socialists" who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as brides to SS men.
The article does not say what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created a state-supported programme known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the programme stipulated that every SS man should have four children, either in or outside the marriage.
Lebensborn homes care for children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the programme was not very actively promoted, reports the U.S. Holocaust Museum.
Instead, Nazi demographic policy focused on family and marriage.
The government encouraged marriage by providing loans and supporting children.
The honorary cross of a German mother was granted to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between the Aryans and the non-Aryans were prohibited by law, the museum's website states.
On the sixth of Sire the traitor, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko was ranked third in the first race of the Finnjolls of the day at the Rio Olympic Games, but remained the top of a whole group of tails at the second race of the day.
In the overall situation, he rose to eight after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to 14th place.
Wind Petäjä-Siren fought for RS:X class day departures in positions 17 and three.
In the overall situation, Petäjä-Siren is in sixth place.
In the 470s, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren were left in 23th place at the opening of the day.
In the overall situation, the Lindgrens are ranked 19.
Jari Sillanpää's Satulinna was recorded in a couple of hours' sleep: "I was so hungover"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of the Finnish favourite artists for over 20 years.
Sillanpää, who was the bartender of the cruise ship for the 1995 tango king, the best-selling solo artist in Finland, and the star of dance platforms and festivals, is still able to pork and is currently in a wild lift.
The book Jari Sillanpää, written by Mari Kopinen, was published today on Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää tells about his life and career in both good and bad.
Bridgehead's career rose to total elevation as he won the crown of the tango king in the Seinäjoki Tango market in 1995.
In the race Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango piece for Sillanpää, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different shape.
The Satulinna song became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says that the recording of the song did not go exactly according to plan: Sillanpää sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and after just a few hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so hung over!
The bridge head remembers in the book.
You wouldn't know it was sung in a hangover right away from recording a song that got a huge hit.
Even though I wasn't physically at my best, the mark was still good.
I learned that you don't have to insist on being perfect and top-notch all the time.
Another incident related to the man's most popular songs, about which the book tells of, took place almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his partner at the time, and the case finally ended up with "You Earn Gold" in texts published as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered from Sarah Törmäs were not what Sillanpää would have wanted.
Sillanpää had imagined himself making a record that tells a true story about his own life, but the words of the song about the divorce were not true, but were written on the basis of the news of the 7-day newspaper.
In the newspaper's news, Jari and his ex-lover were told the reason for his excessive partying and alcohol consumption, but Jar said it was a total nonsense and it wasn't true.
According to the book, Jari was furious with the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it... and that's good.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
Finally, 52 per cent of the voters were in favour of the difference and 48 per cent would have remained in the Union, even though the polls during the voting week are predicting the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flaged for divorce, even though a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The Western Policy Mantra, the theme of the recent election campaign by former US President Bill Clinton, "It's the economy, the stupid" flew into a scrap heap in Britain's Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic Curly Language
The Centre for Macroeconomics in its latest monthly survey responds from the professional community to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economists were not listened to because this time the voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation for the economic loss is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the illusion that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people employed, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's off the right Brit.
Many people also have the impression that a reduction in the value of the currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economist, voters did not believe the economic arguments because the consensus of economists did not come up sufficiently.
In particular, they were stricken by the fairness of the BBC, which gave only a couple of percent of the economists who were pro-European economists as well as the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hate press was not interested in telling what the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic powerful combinations of the consequences of the separation were about.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly of economic growth, commercial relations, sovereign debt and currency.
And if the messages of economists were both listened to and understood, they were ignored because economists represent an elite with whom voters feel they have no common interests.
Although academics such as economists would have remained in the EU, in small towns and rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is also an economy
The overwhelming profit motive of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
The immigrant will take your job, the immigrant will jam your hospital, the immigrant will take advantage of you.
These arguments work.
Every coffee shop has foreign employees.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health center in the waiting room sees immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the British to get medical appointments if they didn't exist?
Every school has immigrant children too.
How much easier would it be for the children of the real British to get a place of education if they got rid of them?
There are foreigners living in every municipality.
How much more space would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond to them and, if they did, their responses did not receive visibility.
Economists failed to explain that immigrants have made the British more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security.
Migrants - and in particular EU immigrants - are net contributors to British public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund prepared for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
He said that Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
A few weeks before the vote, plans B, that is to say, the victory of a camp that favours the separation of the EU, began to be prepared more precisely in case the result was broad.
The concern was that investors would start to withdraw their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have substantial liquid assets, but could now be necessary.
We went out to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on 23rd, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets," Vanhanen says about Aberdeen's only open daily real estate fund, which was the subject of the news.
Old man says the normal level would be 15-20 percent.
The value of the fund at that time was GBP 3.5 billion.
The total value of the company's funds is approximately £20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, says Vanhanen of all UK real estate funds.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was 10% or even below.
So the real estate funds prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
The funds closed down trading.
When the EU camp won, Europe went crazy.
However, the less than two weeks after the vote on the real estate market were quite calm," says Vanhanen.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, who estimated that Brexit could be a major risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trade.
Together, they raided the situation and brought the matter to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started spinning, and one fund after another had to close its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash raised, but it also eventually had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually close trade, but changed pricing downwards.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether the money should now be thrown out in a panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would cost you.
It calmed things down, and most of them canceled the announcement.
Since then it has been quite steady, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks," says Vanhanen.
He points out that, for example, there has been no such turmoil in the Aberdeen continental European funds.
However, there were a lot of inquiries.
Unreasonably Pay Attention to Real Estate Funds
Vanhanen felt that the closures of real estate funds received an excessive amount of attention.
The open funds concerned by the closures dominate around 4% of British real estate.
Aberdeen's blockade lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties out of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned their investors this week that it might keep its funds closed to the 2017 side.
At the moment there is uncertainty in the air and economic growth forecasts have been torn down, but the situation does not seem to be more "funny" for Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has even created new opportunities for some real estate investors," Vanhanen points out.
The exchange rate for pound and dollar is at its lowest in 30 years, and there is also a 15% discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property for up to 30 percent cheaper.
There are many willing buyers," says Vanhanen.
Brexit's operations in the real estate market in London
At two o'clock in the morning, things didn't look like much.
But at four o'clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, who was responsible for the real estate investments in Aberdeen Asset Management in Britain, woke up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the word for power.
I realized that this is now going to plan B," Vanhanen says in his other home in Helsinki.
He went straight to work.
London City was already completely alive in spite of the morning.
The normally silent TV screens at the office were making news, and usually the loud people were completely silent when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell about his resignation.
When the market opened, the screen terminals flashed only red.
It was one of those mornings you never thought you'd be alive," says Vanhanen.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain's largest real estate funds, finalised two real estate transactions the day after the Brexit vote, i.e. the midsummer.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company was well prepared for the option, which is why the situation was kind of calm," says Vanhanen.
The Brexit vote started the repair shop
The vote was followed by a storm.
The weight collapsed, the British leadership went into change.
The market started to anticipate drastic falls in the real estate market in Britain and London in particular.
In the years to come, the London office premises were forecast to have losses of up to 20%.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the mussel has ceased, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it does not appear to be the last summer holidays on the face of Vanhanen who spent his summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
He thinks it is far too early to say much about Brexit.
So much remains to be done: how the difference will be made and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
The development of the real estate market in London has already been the subject of first information.
CBRE's information on price developments covers about one third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all London properties fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City office buildings, minus 6.1 per cent was accumulated, says Vanhanen.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have had worse figures," says Vanhanen.
All similar falls hit crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting, too, because Brexit was very quickly compared with the fall of Lehman and the global economic crisis that began in the US real estate market.
The old man does not think that the parable is quite right, because this is a home-to-house crisis in Britain.
The atmosphere is different.
The real estate market has not now seen panic sales like that time, but the willingness to sell to improve liquidity," says Vanhanen.
There's a financial guarantee that's normal.
The repair movement could have been ahead of us anyway.
In fact, the price adjustment movement is not a miracle to him - it could have been there without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen's estimate, real estate prices in London and other major cities in the world have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City, and especially the offices, are overpriced," says Vanhanen.
So the drop started very high.
London prices have gone up for four reasons, Vanhanen's list.
The British economy has grown strongly and the population in London has grown strongly.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last category of ownership that becomes globalized," says Vanhanen.
New players have entered the market from the Middle East and Asia, and more institutions and private investors are also looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is an easy target as a known city.
In addition, prices have been fuelled by low interest rates, which have led, for example, pension companies to seek returns on new destinations.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although, according to Vanhanen, the leverage has now been used significantly less than during the boom that preceded the 2008 crisis.
Decentralize. Decentralize.
In London, the rise in prices evened out last summer," says Vanhanen.
Even Aberdeen began to lighten his holdings in London, and last year he was a net seller.
There was some kind of twist to be expected, and now it's here.
So, what's the next step?
It depends on how the British economy develops," says Vanhanen.
He's afraid to judge much of the future, but he says there's probably not going to be any pick-up.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a downward or steady movement ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen several moves up and down, as he has been in the real estate business since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who thinks you can work through the pits.
If you're well prepared for risks, you're in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you've invested in one market, you're too much of a victim.
If you have decentralisation, the risks are also decentralised," says Vanhanen.
S Group will start to register shop information in more detail than before
Soon the S Group will know what you're eating, as the trading group announced today that they are starting to collect more detailed information about their customers' purchases.
To date, once data have been collected on the total amount of the receipt, the group will also start at the beginning of May to harass it about the products purchased.
The S Group follows Kesko here, as the data on goods purchased with a plus card have been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, the CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data are collected with the customer's consent and are used for marketing purposes subject to authorisation.
The most effective channel is e-mail.
Not many customers have banned the use of product information," Riitala says to Taloussanomit.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to the change in registration of the S Group.
Kesko already classes its regulars according to food purchases in ten groups.
The classification is updated monthly.
Stock customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The information is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchasing data are collected only from K-Group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a customer loyalty programme and there is no such programme planned for the moment.
Finland's Lähikauppa has its own Onesbonus customer loyalty program, which can be connected to Valtatalos, Siwos and Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect data at product or product group levels, we stick to the total amount of the receipt.
So we know which store the purchases were made and on what day and the customer's receipt total.
We have not gone to the level of the K-Group or the S-Group," says Anu Ora, Commercial Director.
According to him, the loyalty programme will be reformed in the future, but Lähikauppa will report on this later.
However, the Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
Start with the experiment.
The customer ownership and customer register of SOK has so far been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal and address information, basic data include occupation, education, form of residence, birthday years of children and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role have also been registered.
The date and time of purchase, place, total purchases and payment method have been stored from the S-Etusicard purchase.
In addition, information from S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, purchase data at product level will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
In S-markets, Prismos, Kodin Terros and ABC chains, data are currently recorded at product group level.
For a long time, customers have been hoping that marketing could be targeted further," says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Ownership and Partner Business at SOK.
The S-Group says they're informing their clients about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific data for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored in cascades, whether they want it or not.
You can check your stored information on the S Group's website.
For example, cashiers cannot access the data," says Saarikoski.
Video: Heila Puppy is Tull's newest dog confirmation - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The black Labrador retriever's puppy vigorously sniffs five similar boxes lined up in the country at Helsinki Airport.
It won't take long for it to sit firmly next to the middle box.
Customs Inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog to play with that favorite toy.
A jar of shell casings for powder gas was discovered in the box next to which Heila sat.
Powder gas is the first smell that has been practiced with Heila," says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and main reasons for e-commerce
Heila is Tulli's first dog specialising in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossings and ports if necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila's main workplace because the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused action in Customs and since the attacks control has been strengthened," says Mikko Grönberg, Chief Inspector General of Customs.
The second main reason for training a gun and explosives dog in Customs' duties is postal deliveries via Helsinki Airport.
As a result of the growing internet trade, up to 40 million mails per year pass through the airport, including weapons and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years at Helsinki Airport, Customs has made some 300 findings related to weapons, arms parts, ammunition and explosives and their precursors from online shopping, passenger plane baggage and air cargo.
Heila will work throughout Helsinki Airport.
It's going to be looking into checked baggage and mail.
In ports, it will be of great benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research," says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of the heil, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School at Kirkkonummi
Heila puppy training is coordinated by Tulli's dog school in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio is also training with Heila at the police and Defence Forces experts.
The police have strong experience in dog training and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs together with other authorities decides which odors Heila is taught to identify.
Heila is always further trained as needed," says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Tulli's six drug dogs and Massi cash and drug dogs.
Labrador retriever Heila has been selected from ten puppy litters.
The selection criteria for the dog to be selected at the airport include racy and hunting instinct, as well as tranquillity because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntio's home, is a close co-worker for the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can't go home without her, Suntio laughs.
The subtle orders go to Heila for a one-time deal.
The evening-Sunami cameraman loses the camera microphone cover for a fast dog, but Heila returns the soft-toy cover immediately from the "remote" command.
Hard competition for work dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests to be carried out, next October, to assess whether the training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heila can be seen working at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to iron a dog wearing a work vest, says Suntio.
The cost of one working dog is approximately EUR 60000-70000 per year.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to their owner's care.
The working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active rates last only from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
The owner of work dogs is a fierce competition in Customs.
Heila's owner was approximately 20-30 Customs employees.
The luck hit Suntio, who has never had a working dog before, but he has years of experience in dogs and surveillance tasks in Customs.
The Mini-State got its first Olympic medal - the people get a day off
The Olympic gold of Fiji with less than a million inhabitants in rugby is valued so high in the country that the government has decreed August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the country's broadcaster, the Fijian government confirmed the case once the championship was over.
The day off is the day after the team's return home.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
Fiji's rugby team was celebrating the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country followed the final in Suva, the capital, where a screen had been set up for the stadium.
Normally only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game linked our multicultural community.
Even in Chinese restaurants there was watching the game, I heard them encouraging," said Fiji Times editor Maikele Seru Guardian.
Dramaa in Rio - a Finnish retriever fainted after a wild performance
The weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded with his last attempt from 175 kilos after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening quality for a lifter.
During or immediately after heavy liftings, he has passed out many times.
No one's really been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola received 175 kilos of push and 145 kilos of pull.
His combined result was 200 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his push in his final 175 kilos, as did one.
In the third attempt, the weights rose with the ferocious roaring.
The body shivered under the weights until the jury approved the withdrawal.
The Finnish promoter's joy was that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired the Estonian attacker Prosa - Betting League - Evening Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Ball Society, which plays in the Men's Football League, has concluded a long-term contract with Estonian attacker Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a leading player on our team with power and a small threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi.
We went through over 50 players from all over the world with more than ten players.
Gradually, Prosa started to stand out as a good alternative," says Coach Juha Malinen of RoPS in the press release.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flora in Tallin, where she scored 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is due to be with RoPS on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemins meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new attacker when last season's goal king Alexander Kokko moved to Australia.
Brave Modern Family Star again: Teenager Star Shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who became familiar with the modern family comedy series Alex Dunphy, is once again blabbering by showing off his body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
Shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also his ass.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing her style and behaviour considerably more courageously.
The star has posed in social media pictures with very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very tight outfits.
Winter, on the eve of adulthood, has recently published several pictures of herself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can see it here.
Earlier this summer Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its image so radically.
In this case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomanTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter was experiencing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He's been on TV almost his whole life, growing up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more you look exposed, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the Modern Family series when she was only 11 years old.
The actor has resented some of his long-term fans with his image change.
It is not difficult to guess where she will be in ten years' time when the downhill is already so hard," says one woman in Winter Instagram.
Some of her fans, on the other hand, defend the actor and urge her to ignore criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what other people say.
You're an inspiration to a lot of women, a young woman.
Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted to northern lights: In autumn it is possible to see a fairy-tale Mirror aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to attract Japanese visitors to Northern Lights from early autumn," Visit Finland says in the release.
Inari and Levi are the main destinations of the Japanese Northern Light Tourism.
Northern lights are the advantage of our winter tourism, and they are strongly linked to heartwinter and snowy landscapes.
There is a great demand for winter trips to Northern Lights in Lapland, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Light season starts early in the autumn and goes far into the spring.
In the autumn it is possible to see the so-called "mirror aurora", where the lake surface reflects the northern lights, making the vision two times more fabulous," says Anne Lind, Acting Marketing Manager of Visit Finland.
Visit Finland's main target group for the Northern Lights campaign are wealthy 25-35-year-old women living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising, among other things.
According to a survey conducted by Aalto University and researchers from the University of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive land image among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need clearer unique attractions from Finland, and according to Lind, Northern Lights have enormous potential.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists in Finland have grown clearly more than other Nordic countries.
Last year they spent more than twice as many nights in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
Japanese are interesting for Finnish tourism as a target group because they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent EUR 183 a day in Finland," says Lind.
Britain settles for rugby silver while Fid's master course leads to gold
Great Britain's impressive progress in the rugby tournament collapsed in Fiji's final challenge at the final of Thursday night when the team suffered 43-7 crushing losses at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji set up a master course in handling, bitings, evasives, support games, running lines and pure force in winning gold - their first Olympic medal.
The loss brought moderate comfort from the silver medal - the third of the British day - and they were proud of their hard work in the Olympic rugby starter tournament, where they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The hard 7-5 victory over South Africa by the semifinals played the same day may have bothered them in the finals.
But despite this, Fidi would have won a team of 15 in this condition.
Perhaps - but probably not - Great Britain is comforted by the fact that at least one Brit has a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fid's head coach is Ben Ryan, former British boss from Wimbledon.
It's been quite a trip for Britain.
Eight years ago, they were coached by Ryan and lost every game in Adelaide's tournament.
This is where they lost only one.
This beating hurts, but it's a startling development.
Fidi started out great, rejecting British tackles for fun.
To Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, it was like they were running into moving buses, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolisau dived into the end zone at an angle.
When the clock was four minutes away, Jerry Tuwai's second touchdown on the right-hand side led to a goal kick.
12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant tackle stopped Leone Nakarawa from making the third goal, but it was just a slow-down for Fid.
At seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored at the right angle, and Great Britain was at 17-0.
Nakarawa scored another start, and there was still more than a minute left on the clock... from the first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou plunged through Britain's loose tackles and rushed to the line to score a goal.
After the goal kick, the situation at break was 29-0.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, whereas Great Britain was just learning the game.
And that is actually the case.
The UK made a lot of changes during the break that blocked Fid's dam... for a whole four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until Joshua Tuisova scored after Fid's impressive pitch game.
Dan Norton scored a touchdown in the left corner and narrowed the score to 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the islanders of the South Sea, whose supporters sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was hard not to admire Fid's joyful approach.
Mata Viliame's last-minute goal was frosting in Fid's cake, which did not need frosting.
The whistle was whistled, the Fidians hugged and the Great Britain fell on the grass, completely beaten.
Earlier that day Fidi had struck Japan in semifinals 20-5, and Great Britain won South Africa in a tight semifinal where both scored one goal - Britain's goal kick solved the game.
Kyle Brown took South Africa to the lead at the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish zone with dazzling footwork and scored under the goalposts at the second half.
A great late tackle from Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother of the England 15-aside rugby team, secured victory and finally a silver medal.
The coach's fight against cancer led Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to a rowing victory.
There will be no more emotional gold in these games, and that really means something.
From the first draft to the last, 220 hard strokes towards history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found deeper meaning in their golden moment on Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they rowed alone, there were three voices on the boat, and the echo of Coach Robin Williams was present all the time, as the two of them engaged in their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's competition - the first women in the history books of British sports that achieved such an achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance as undefeated, which is also record.
This, what we see, two brilliant athletes joining on the surface with swan grace, does not fully reflect the nature of victory.
Each rowing gold is based on a group of helpful pairs of hands that gradually contribute to the things that matter. And no pair of hands was as essential as a coach who, 30 months ago, did not know if he would live to this day.
As he said, the situation was close.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be operated on, and they performed the surgery.
If they don't cut, it'll spread everywhere.
It could have been pretty bad.
It'll change your thinking a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was fortunate to have been able to start his treatment in early 2014 outside the season when they caused as little disturbance as possible - if that expression can ever be used in situations such as this.
I had to get paid, so I had to heal quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital, and I was walking around the ward, 20, 30, 50 feet at a time, and they said that a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing in itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the first thought of the couple was Williams, who had had a nervous morning, and he had spoken a little more than usual, trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, an experienced captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment of Afghanistan, said: "I have been an emotional wreck this week, which may be a little overreaction, but this means so much to me."
It only emphasizes how important this is to me, how hard Helen and I have worked, and Robin too.
The past three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
If it wasn't for Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so he's got a lot of thanks. He's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better intern partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost the competition in five years.
The couple set a heavy rhythm that their rivals couldn't reach.
Even at the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Denmark teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in storage.
We were very close in the moment.
Helen screamed "Persistance in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't try to do anything special.
We were not looking for fireworks today, we were just trying to get good rowing and win the race, and we did.
A couple waits a year before deciding their future.
Glover will attend the wedding next month when he marries a TV adventurer named Steve Backshall.
Right now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last race.
It would have put too much pressure on you.
After London it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
This feels so much better," he said.
Iceland is changing the government of Panama leaks
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which the protesters who have been enraged by the Panama data leaks will be demanding in the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians were circumventing taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of a scandal, but that was not enough for protestors.
His successor Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson then promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
Election Day has now been decided on October 29th.
Analysts say it is difficult to predict how much the people's rage last spring will affect the result of the autumn election.
In June, in the presidential elections, criticalness towards those in power was clearly evident, and Gudni Johannesson, who had been nominated from outside politics, was elected President.
Trump said he was being sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of ISIS.
Donald Trump, president candidate for the US Republicans, withdrew his latest tumults.
He said that he was being sarcastic when he claimed that President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organisation ISIS and that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton would be involved in setting up the organisation.
The Democratic Party was enraged by the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
You should never let anyone in command of the army fall so low, Clinton tweeted.
In the south of France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of burkini bathing suits on bathing beaches, which are popular with Muslims, says the British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that all who do not have a good manner and a bathing suit that respects secularism are prohibited from going to the beaches and swimming.
The decision also states that bathing suits, which extantly express religious ties, may increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating the French National Day.
At the end of July, two men connected to ISIS attacked a church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
The quality of the bathing waters in the Oulu region passed through the sieve - Pyykösjärvi lake blue seaweed rain
Water samples taken from the official bathing areas of the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only the lake Toykös has been observed to have blue seaweed precipitation.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environmental Action took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public bathing areas in the Oulu Region.
With the exception of the shore of Meriniemi, the levels of E. coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in all bathing areas were below the operational limits laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The concentrations of E. coli and enterococci in the bathing area of Meriniemi were confirmed on Wednesday when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the action limit.
The sea of Toykösjärvi does not yet make the water unfit for swimming, but under favourable conditions the situation can quickly turn into a blue-green flower, resulting in the formation of blue-green algae mass on the surface of the water as rafts.
The environmental action will monitor the situation with more frequent inspections.
If the blue seaweed precipitate turns into a blue seaweed flower, this will also be reported separately on the bathing area's information board.
Check the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK's Hakkarainen Forest Gift Reduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside
Forest gift reduction is one of the tax changes proposed by the Ministry of Finance for next year's budget.
A tax deduction is proposed for the Income Tax Act, which would be granted on the basis of a gift tax on the generational change of forest holdings.
In the Ministry of Finance's proposal, forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote generational changes in forest farms, to rejuvenate forest owners' age structure, to increase forest size and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry's aim is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would deduct the clean capital income of forestry.
The idea of making such a tool to promote generational changes in forest farms is a good one, comments Juha Hakkarainen, Director of Forests of the Federation of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, he finds criticisms in the proposal for a tax change.
Forest gift reduction is proposed for the clean capital income of the forest owner.
It is a capital income minus all other deductions.
According to MTK and Hakkarainen, the effectiveness of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the sales income of wood.
The VM's proposal starts by reducing the pure capital income of forestry to prevent it from becoming a loss in the capital income of forestry, which would be deducted from other taxes.
Such a person would receive tax benefits even if he did not sell wood.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner is unable to understand it," says Hakkarainen.
In addition, he says that the model only applies to a small proportion of forest owners.
The threshold for tax deduction linked to the yield value of forests is EUR 40 000 in the proposal.
It's too high for Hakkarainen's opinion.
As such, he says, it will cut 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners out of the deductible circle.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of forest owners," he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of increasing the size of the farm.
In forestry policy, forest gift reduction has been taking Hakkarainen decades.
It is based on the ageing of the forest owners.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful hailstorm caught the motorists at Himanga... two cars derailed into a ditch... and ran into each other.
A special chase took place on Friday morning in Himanga, Kalajoki.
According to the Rescue Department, two cars in a row fell into a ditch, after which the person behind hit the chaser.
According to Harri Pyhtä, on-call firefighter, the drifting into the ditch is suspected of being caused by intense hailing.
There were two persons in the car behind, both of whom were transported to the hospital for treatment.
There's no more specific information about their injuries.
The driver of the vehicle driving ahead was not injured.
The accident occurred on highway 8 from Himanga a few miles to Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments.
Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska's findings show that the hardness of a cancer tumor increases cancer's malignancy.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue around the cancer to match normal soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of anticancer treatments may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cancer cells and surrounding tissue.
The results of the research were published on 4 August in the prestigious journal Nature Communications on cell biology.
Muhos's family home killing continues in court, the prosecutor also requests a murder sentence for another perpetrator.
Muhos's domestic killing continues at court for both sentenced persons.
In June, two young men were sentenced to imprisonment for family home killing in Muhos.
One received eight years for, among other things, killing and aggravated robbery as a young person.
The sentence of another is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The sentenced person was also sentenced for serious endangerment of road safety as a young person and for driving a vehicle without entitlement as a young person.
The prosecution, the plaintiffs and the man who received the harsher sentence appealed against the judgment of the district court.
The prosecution demands a lesser sentence for a man convicted of murder committed as a young person for 12 years in prison.
They were in full understanding at the time of the act.
According to the District Court, 17-year-old youths killed a man who worked as a director of the child welfare unit in the schoolhouse in July last year.
A 17-year-old convicted of murder attacked a director from behind on the sofa in the living room.
The director had let go of the grip and led the youngster to his room, when one of the youths hit him with a vacuum tube.
The director was also strangled with leadership, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to a state of mind study, both convicted persons were fully understood at the time of the act.
According to the court, young people had planned an escape from a family home, at least since the day before.
Ice shark is the world's longest vertebrate species, increasing only at 156 years of age
The longest living vertebrate in the world is confirmed by ice shark, says a study published in Science magazine.
In the northern Atlantic, such as Greenland, an ice shark can live up to 400 years of age.
The female does not grow until she is 156 years old.
The ice shark's life span is increased by only one centimetre a year.
Only one species of shellfish is known to live longer than ice sharks.
Investigators found out how old they were with radiocarbons.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks contained radioactive residues.
They allowed researchers to estimate the age of sharks.
The elder's age was estimated to be 392 years - although throwing in one direction or another may be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as a financial resource - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need another world.
Even a third of the State's total tax revenue would not be received if Donald Trump's change to corporate tax was carried out.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, especially with the tax cuts that benefit the richest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it on Monday in Detroit.
Business tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
There would be a huge sum of $1,000 billion a year left uncollected.
The highest rate of income tax is now 39,6, after the discount proposed by Trump 33.
The inheritance tax would be abolished altogether.
Trump accused the State of over-regulation of the economy and of bankrupting small businesses.
The agreed environmental standards of haste must be renewed and energy regulation must be dismantled.
The health reform of Barack Obama needs to be re-examined.
We need to appoint "experts" instead of "bureaucrats".
According to Trump, 'expensive' trade policy is one of the main causes of the problems facing the United States.
The free trade agreements would be terminated.
Imports from China would receive a 45% and a 35% penalty tax from Mexico.
We're offering a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our creed, Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need another world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes will unite cities, American ships will control the seas, American steel will lift up new skyscrapers throughout the country.
Unlike his ways, Trump faithfully read through a speech written by assistants, even though it was interrupted 14 times by well - organized protests.
Economists - including those close to the Republicans - see Trump's programme taking the United States into deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own programme early on Friday Finnish time.
Attack from the past - People's News
The sea is frantic, but the actual tide strikes in the middle of Madrid's street war - reckoning with the past can begin.
That sums up Pedro Almodóvar's new story.
Almodovar's previous steering work Travel lovers (2013) was a fun little satirical comedy, followed by Iho, where I live at the top of my Spanish career (2011).
Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between the two works.
It's a casually serene love, relationship and family drama centered on a mother-daughter relationship.
The story is simple and is seen as much of a long flashback.
Life seems to be on its way with the middle-aged name person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a random encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) will be amazed to the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Juliet repeated the stages of her life to her grown - up daughter.
He begins with the time before his daughter was born, the moments when he met his future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, comes to the second leading woman, who is a TV star from the series Ommelte (2013-2014).
Julieta's aging has been handled in a way that can be regarded as a slob, but I would say that it is time for a one-time wipe.
The Almodóvar films often have a fair distance from such characteristic blighting to the humor of Julieta.
It is a flatly played, subdued, place with good music in some places and a rather sad-minded film, which has the ingredients for elegance.
Instead, the visual saturation typical of the Spanish director is still in place and so that it gradually begins to stick more in the eye as a pure form than as a working dramatic power.
The characters in the film are affected by sickness, death or otherwise by sudden loss, but the surface remains as fine.
This is particularly true for costumes: in the case of a name person, costumes change from scene to scene, and the same applies to spectacular earrings.
Almodóvar is very specific in these matters, but the main issue, that is, the tunes of the scene in question, is not getting any better.
Mechanically, when the impression is repeated, it is external and slightly inanimate.
Almodóvar has produced the manuscript on the basis of the 2013 Nobel Prized Canadian Alice Munro's three novels.
The Novells have been published in Runaway: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly equidistant literary filming.
The ingredients would have been emotionally unmatched to even more dramatic drama, so much big things - especially gnawing guilt - are dealt with in the cinema's theology.
Directory and script: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on Alice Munro's three novels.
Main performance: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The premiere of the film is 12.8.
The government is trying to make an election effort - People's News
No new cuts will be made, saying ministers, so that the basic Finns will not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided on in the spring are going to be a lot of work.
There will be no further surgery.
The $4 billion savings that have already been decided will be enough.
This is confirmed by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (right) under the budget line.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM's proposal, since the cuts in social security were already decided in the spring framework.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index are cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of paid unemployment benefit will be reduced from 500 days to 400 days.
Training cuts continue.
Municipal elections haunt you.
Why do ministers so much stress the fact that no new cuts are made on them?
Because next year's an election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and are the most important thermometer of the parliamentary term, not the polls.
It has been seen before that the municipal election result, which takes the government parties in different directions, will ruin the government's mood for a long time.
The Gallup report, however, that the government party expects the basic Finns to lose their lives, even though the result of its previous elections was a modest 12.3 per cent compared with the parliamentary elections.
The base Finns received 752 new delegates four years ago, of which the price of influence in the right-wing government will be realised for a large part next spring.
The lifeline of the government of the three parties of approximately equal size depends on the ability of the Finns to stand up.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of the people who voted for the party had had enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's attendance have also come to light.
First of all, new cuts are not to be seen in rhetoric, which obscures the fact that next year they are going to be carried out violently and, second, they are trying to soften the initial Finnish attack.
Major surgery in 2018?
In a year's time, everything will probably be different if Sipilä's government is still standing.
The government has set itself the goal of indebtedness in this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo's draft budget will take €5.9 billion next year, more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands at the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to comply with its own programme: debt will not be broken or even slowed down.
The second is to stick to the program.
It means new even harder cuts on top of the old ones in the 2017 budget line.
The budget would be pushed at least close to balance during 2018 and then in the spring the parliamentary elections will accept what is going to happen.
These measures will not break down debt
It is quite clear that the current measures do not break down debt, even though Juha Sipilä tries to stimulate a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäe at the press conference prove this irrefutablely:
World economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. there will be no leverage from the international economy.
Finland's national economy has hardly increased since the collapse in 2008, except temporarily during the recovery policy in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% in this decade and has continued on average from 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion more a year than in 2008.
With the curves presented by Hetemäe, general government debt, which exceeded the 60% limit in 2014, will reach 70% in the middle of next decade.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt recovery presented by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, it will cost about EUR 6 billion to maintain unemployment, which will be effectively covered by a completely new debt.
This is the understanding of the city center, the National Coalition Party and the Finns of basic Finland as to what is responsible.
Survey: People want to leave a lot of tasks to municipalities
Three out of four consider that the organisation of child day care, youth work and physical activity is the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the population also carries responsibility for libraries, culture, adult education centres, building supervision, upper secondary school education and waste management to the individual municipality.
Regional planning, special care, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for the disabled are most clearly the responsibility of the region.
There is no desire to transfer any of the tasks under the responsibility of the municipalities to the State.
A minor drunk driver ran away from the police at the end of the chase.
A 16-year-old motorcyclist in Joensuu ran from a police patrol in Joensuu at Ilomantstie on Friday night at half past midnight.
A police patrol tried to stop a motorcycle without lights, but a young man took off to run away from the police at a fair speed.
The chase continued on the Sonakajanranta road, from which the road continued to Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but a faster - footed policeman ran to catch the fugitive.
A blow test on the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
Nor did he have a driver's license that justified riding a motorcycle.
Among other things, the case is being investigated as a serious threat to road safety.
A truck in a rock truck fell into a ditch.
A truck loaded with stone fell into a ditch in Lake Polvijärvi on Kavintie on Thursday night at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had drifted to the left in a curved bend out of the road and fell on its side into a ditch.
The rescue service lifted the injured driver out of the fallen truck through the door that remained above, together with the rescue helicopter staff and paramedics.
It was the car owner's job to lift the vehicle.
There was hydraulic oil draining out of the fallen truck that was sucked into the peat by the rescue department.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared this afternoon on the river Ilmajoki
A 87-year-old woman has been missing since this afternoon in Ilmajoki, Lahti, South Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for a woman, about six feet [665 cm] tall, thin, and well - rounded, with white hair under her jaw.
Observations and tips on lost movements are asked to call the hotline of the Ostrobothnia Situation Centre 0295440513.
The ingredients of a major accident in the air - look at the destruction of the photo gallery Parafest
The fall current that knocked down the Parafest Festival tents caused massive destruction.
Arto Pepperi, Chairman of the Parafest Association of Joensuu, estimates that the festival will get on its feet financially, and the event can also be held next year.
The last performer of Parafest, Kalle Salonen, performed at the market place at the end of Friday night.
On Saturday, the program will continue with performances in the city theatre premises starting at 1 p.m.
The art center in Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The programme will be organised as planned.
The flow flow occurs in thunderstorms when rainwater and its weight triggers a falling flow of air.
The changes in the shape of the water in the thunder cloud bind heat, and thus the falling air mass cools and its speed toward the earth accelerates.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that there are several rush currents in Finland during the summer.
It's hard to predict the route of the currents.
The rush flow hit the back yard of the Joensuu Art Museum, where Parafest took place, Friday afternoon before 5.
Three tents fell down, with a total of about 200 people in tents.
In an accident, four persons were mildly injured.
Among them was one child who was transported with minor injuries to further treatment.
Air pollution ages Londoners
According to the study, the skin of Londoners is aging faster than usual.
The cause of skin ageing is air pollution.
The British study is reported by the Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analysed the most toxic particles in London air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that many pensioners in London have two and a half years older skin than, say, a fellow who lives in rural areas.
Skin ageing fine particles are very fine dust pollution that comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, kill nearly 9 500 Londoners every year.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac's study found that early aging is a risk, especially for Londoners who travel on their business trips near crowded streets.
The residents of London may try to protect themselves from air pollution by means of masks, for example, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
The tractor's brakes failed, pushed the man standing in front of it.
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
After he got off the tractor and went to the front of it, the tractor's brakes failed and the tractor ran over the man.
The man was not under it, but the tractor was able to push the man enough to be transported to the central hospital with serious injury to the further investigation.
The tractor did not run any further because it ran into the rocks in the front.
Resurrection to the coming season
The League-Riento, a member of the league of the Volleyball Championship, starts the series in October from better starting points than from memory.
The team's been together for almost three weeks.
The common tune is found with certainty better than in previous periods, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
Jani Säisä says that the new team is entrepreneurial and united.
Out of a third country, middle fighter Fred Musoni begins his second term in Rienno.
The new face is 23 years old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, a member of the Rwandan national team, is a 500-inch chipper.
Garchet is a passari, the Brazilian has a length of 198 cents.
Through Josban, Kataja and River Boys to the US national team
Anne Jumpmänen has been playing at almost all the World Cup competitions in the gym band since 2003.
Now Tampere is already on the sixth race, only 2013 missed Canada's better North American tryouts.
I worked in Turku and played with women there when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a gym bandy national team.
I got interested, and here we are, Pompänen, 48, says.
Jumper was born in 1967 near New York in the city of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was one year old.
In 1987, Kempänen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, no such sport was played at the SM level as the gym bandy.
They played the ball at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in Jokipoj hockey in the SM series, Kempänen remembers.
In the course of the 1991-92 season, the next three seasons were spent in Josba.
In addition to playing, he coached the A-girls to the championship.
Women's SM career culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumpmänen played in the women's SM series through 10 seasons, the balance of 169 matches was 51+34=85.
The latest SM period is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen were appointed to the national team
The Joensuu hall bandy club Josban was raised by Perttu Puska and Enoinen-based Tatu Väänänen were selected to join the Finnish national team that will play in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
Perttu Puska, a 25-year-old attacker in Helsinki, has played six men's land matches before this, where he has accumulated a total power score of 9+4=13.
The 32-year-old defenseman of Wiler-Ersigen in Switzerland, Tatu Väänänen, has recovered from a thigh problem and is a member of the national team's standard equipment with 117 national matches experience.
The national team was also named Mika Kohonen, who was last seen in Finland at the World Cup last December.
Petri Kettunen from Kontiolahti is the head coach of the Salibandy National Team.
Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM gold is missing from the prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is about to quit as a beach volley player at least temporarily after the current season.
The Finnish championships of Beach Volley will be decided at Kouvola Sports Park this weekend.
In three days, medals are played in series of adults and young people alike.
In cooperation with Kouvola Volley Ballers and the Finnish Volley Ball Association, the final tournament will qualify for the six best pairs of each ranking in the series.
The local colour in the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, who has been a member of the Finnish beach volley for several years.
Hasu, who lives in Helsinki today, is looking forward to playing games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get into the stands this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena at the Pesis Stadium.
I haven't played in adult shows very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in finals at home," Hasu says.
The Kouvola region set up Hasu's spark for sports and gave good food for a great hobby.
There are good memories of childhood.
I started volleyball when I was 9 years old at Elimäki's NMKY E-girls.
On top of the picture is too big a jersey, knee pads spinning around the ankles and huge aces and choreographs after the point," Hasu recalls.
In a small place, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
Everyone's families were strongly involved - the teammate's father trained us and our mother was the chairman of the club for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was already a natural choice of species in the junior era to counterbalance the indoor volleyball.
The beach has been playing a bit since the 1990s.
The activities of visitors have always been active.
I also went to see the Junior SM Tours myself, thinking that one day I'd be there to play.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays with Annina Parkkinen from the beat-up hill on the weekend at the SM finals.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked duo in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
SM gold we still lack in the trophy cabinet, Hasu throws enigmaticly.
The performance of the weekend in Kouvola may be the last one in front of Hasu's familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges await civilian work.
Yes, the international career will be over after the Kiskallio tournament.
Otherwise, the toe slippers will be placed on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu is planning.

Solomon's Koli courageously set out as an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as an entrepreneur means taking risks, sweat and energy.
The young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future in the countryside as well.
Soon two years ago, Koli, together with his younger brother Valtteri Koli, began acting as an extension of their home space.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers through his own experience.
Starting out as a rural entrepreneur meant taking out debt and increasing the size of the order so that bread could come out of agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always been happy to do business on the farm, and now that I started out as an entrepreneur myself, I've put everything into play.
If you start something, I think you have to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started building a barn, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
However, I was really brave enough to go along with the project and have been fully involved in it," Solomon Koli says, adding that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in the production of pure Finnish food and in the fact that everything is going to turn out well.
The goal of Solomon's beef - raising Kol is to invest in even larger barns.
The work has been successful, as Solomon's Koli has been selected as the top ten in the competition of the young food producer of Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible victory.
He can be voted on the magazine's website until August 21st.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest figure for years (after June 2012) and the first figure above zero after October last year, when a positive 0.2% was reported.
Annual average inflation, measured by the cost-of-living index, was -0.8% in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016), compared with the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The cost-of-living index for July 2016 was 101.0 % compared to June 2016, i.e. the monthly inflation rate was 1.0 %.
From the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) inflation rate has been -0.2% and annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, the price of the following consumer goods increased: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household supplies and routine care (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat's "anime" effect is rated Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, anime has been an inspiration to the filter, but some observers say it is racist.
With its lens tool Snapchat enables some 150 million daily users to modify reality and play with identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character that fits Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lens are simple, face - twisting tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies a day.
All false steps quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat lenses have previously been criticised for promoting blackface mask or favouring bleached skin color as a beauty ideal.
So when Snapchat this week advertised to some users a lens that gave them crooked eyes, crooked teeth and chubby cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - "yellow face" or yellow face.
And they wonder if these recurring polemics could be a sign of the company's greater problem of diversity.
News and disapproval spread widely on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day later Snapchat said he had abolished the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant as a tribute to anime characters, not a caricature of Asians.
But for observers who experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others strongly denied anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely distributed from the photographs, said in her e-mail that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable".
He added that "it is difficult to argue against comparisons between the most gross Asian caricature and the effects of the filter".
It shows that the filter is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face taken to extreme demeaning.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural trip lines.
American culture seems to be tied up in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from meeting rooms of corporations to Hollywood and equipment that we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat's huge audience of more racially diverse young people may mean that they are even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
In an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates an offensive image of the user, "it's much more difficult for these guys to be inconspicuous."
On Thursday, Zhu, Product Manager and Engineer working for Medium decided to remove his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his paper to Medium and in a telephone interview, he said that he believed that racial disputes reflected the lack of diversity in Snapchat's pay practices.
Zhu criticised the company's mainly white male management and concluded his writings with hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#RemoveSnapchat)
"They either do not have a diverse representation of different skin colors in their staff, which is why they are able to make decisions like this," Zhu, a Chinese American, said, "or they have representatives of different skin colors at work, but they are not in positions where they feel safe or could speak directly."
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint to which Snapchat has largely failed to respond.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff, pointing out its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial background of his staff, but according to the representative, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on under-represented populations and to carry forward internal integration efforts.
For his part, Zhu said that he kept his Snapchat account closed, adding: "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to say that this is not okay."
According to the Congressional Panel, military officials distorted Isis intelligence.
In a report published on Thursday, the Congressional Panel said that the authorities from the headquarters of the U.S. Armed Forces Military Region were editing intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than was justified by events on the ground.
The interim report of the working group set up by the Republican Chairman of the Parliamentary Defence Force Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defence Resources Sub-Committee found "widespread discontent" among the intelligence analysts at headquarters who said that the superiors tampered with their assessment of the American efforts to defeat Isis.
The headquarters, known as Centcom, is the headquarters of the Armed Forces Military Region in Tampa, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The results of intelligence approved by the higher Centcom leaders typically gave a more positive picture of U.S. anti-terrorism efforts than was justified by the facts on the ground, which were generally more positive than the analyses produced by other intelligence community authors," stated the press release in the report.
"The events of Centcom are unacceptable - our fighters in the war suffer when bad analyses are presented to high-ranking decision-makers," said Ken Calvert, a California Republican.
The failure of Centcom's management reaches the very top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the constant problems in the descriptions and analyses of headquarters in the United States of America's efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide clear evidence that the senior administrative authorities of the Obama regime have ordered reports to be tampered with, it does describe the sensation of analysts as if Centcom's leaders had put pressure on them to describe in a more positive light the threat posed by the Islamic State, ISIS.
"In the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and certificates from the headquarters to Congress were much more positive than the events themselves," said the report.
For example, Centcom's authority publicly stated that a major attack to recapture Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still in the hands of ISIS.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear," said Mike Pompeo, the Kansas Republican, in the statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest intelligence leaders of the US Military Region headquarters manipulated the intelligence output of the headquarters in order to minimize the threat of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans created a working group after hearing that analysts had raised concerns about the manipulation of intelligence about the Islamic state.
The report published on Thursday will be followed by more extensive results while the investigation is under way.
The Chief Inspector of the Department of Defense has begun an extraordinary ongoing investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, the members of the Parliamentary Intelligence Committee published their own findings which were in line with some of the conclusions of the Republican working group.
"From 2014 to 2015, Centcom created an unnecessarily isolated process from the intelligence assessment of ISIS and Iraqi security forces," said Adam B. Schiff, the Committee's leading democrat.
According to Schiff, this process "continued the publication of intelligence outputs", worsened the mood among analysts and "did not give enough room for different perspectives".
Mr Schiff and the Democrats said that they did not find any evidence that the White House had tried to pressure Centcom analysts to reconcile their conclusions with 'pre-set or political narrative'.
The Daily Beast will report on the preliminary results of the Congressional investigation on Tuesday.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon Chief Inspector has begun an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Commander Patrick Evans, a representative of the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Department of Defence will not comment on the Congressional report as long as the Chief Inspector's investigation is ongoing.
But he said that "the experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a sound dialogue on these essential issues of national security".
The investigation has other consequences than the question of whether the US-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria are successful (as the growing number of defence authorities now claim).
Last year's accusations questioned how much President Obama can count on the headquarters to deliver honest assessments of the military activities of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of the intelligence of the Islamic state reflects the dispute over a decade ago when the Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research article that said that despite protests from several analysts, President George W. Bush's regime supported a small army in Iraq and spent very little time considering the consequences of the attack in 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion regarding the intelligence of the Islamic state.
According to the authorities, last year, the Hooker Group concluded that, despite public statements to the contrary, the air strikes against refineries controlled by the Islamic State had not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil through the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery was not reported outside headquarters.
The Centcom commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, began to be criticised last year after many legislators considered his testimony to the Senate as an over-positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins for the fourth time in a row at the women's field hockey, organising a showdown with Britain
The day after having scored three goals while the team won Japan 6-1, Katie Bam scored on Thursday the first two goals of the U.S. Women's Hockey team when the Americans won India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he wasn't sure if he had done the same before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps track of his goals."
But he knows this: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and they share their group's first place with Britain, which was still unbeatable after winning Japan's 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have made it to the quarterfinals, and this game will determine who's first and who's second in their six team.
First ranked to avoid a strong Holland, the leader of the second group, a little longer when the quarter finals begin.
In any event, as Saturday's game ends, the Americans have been alarmed by their surprising success here, four years after they left the last of the 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in the Pennsylvania Blue Bell and picked up a field hockey bat for the first time when he was 3 years old (his older twin sisters played the sport in Drexel) in connection with the national team at 16 when he became the youngest player of all time.
He was not involved in the 2008 Olympic Games because he was not included in the final list of players.
In 2012, nothing worked out for him and his teammates.
The following year Craig Parnham of England was appointed coach, and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
In London, we didn't have the same pace of work as we do now.
We've made a turn around.
On Thursday night, Bam started his first half-time goal with a knuckle close to the goal.
India had come to the game with one victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score at 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took over.
He was carrying the ball for a long time on the left side of the field, then he went into the middle and pulled the ball to the finish line, taking the Americans to the 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal halfway through the fourth round.
This zero game was the first U.S. goaltender in the tournament to Jackie Briggs, who had scored one goal in each of the first three wins.
He's in a good mood.
So is Bam.
"We have a good situation now," Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
The peace of the trampoline in the middle of the Olympic frenzy
Wherever you are, no matter what time it is, the Olympics are on.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be a constant and inevitable, fierce message of competition and effort.
It's like the Olympic torch itself is a flaming baton passed from archer to swimmer and gymnast to triathlonist.
It is impossible to turn on television, read a newspaper or listen to a neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the anger between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first time in the Olympics and the future heartbreaker with his smile pits, could well be one of the names known to everyone for their best time and supported by sponsorship agreements and TV commercials - if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28 from Lake Forest, California, competes for Olympic gold in the trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all species as much.
Further away from the center, partly in the shade, are those species that are not generally accepted by all: aerial gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We always have a breast swim. Long live it.
But if I may make a moderate number of my special favorites, I would like to draw attention to the subdued appeal of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it made its first appearance at the Sydney Games, there are so few observations between its presence in the past 16 years that many I interviewed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all.
This can be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the sport, it has never won a medal, and its athlete did not make it to the finals until 2012.
The Chinese and Russians usually hand out medals for men, Chinese and Canadian women.
This year, Dong Dong of China and Rosie McLennan of Canada defend their London gold medals.
However, there is a certain underdog's appeal to trampolines, partly because it sounds more appropriate to the uncivilized ear to clown school than to the Olympics.
Here I have to admit that I'm not an expert, I'm just an incapacitated fan.
The species has possibilities for amusement, as you can see from the vibrations of the endless bounces of cartoon films, but it also has the sweetness of gymnastics and swimming jumps, two species that it basically combines.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means springboard.
The champions jump to the height of almost 30 feet with a giant trampoline and have to perform rolling motion series (turns, folds, and volts) and finally land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they will be assessed on the basis of implementation, difficulty and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 countries compete, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction of the Olympic Games is straight ahead.
Those hoping for medals must go further, faster, up and over - sometimes to the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
They are hunting not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in televised news, another scoffing border: the world record or the Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable and even fanatical - and it can even make the viewer cry.
But that is also the reason why even watching the games can be a little exhausting.
Trampoline's giving me a break from this.
Trampolin's heading up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The competitor ascends to a new climb, seemingly weightless as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Of course, there is no lack of competition or difficulty, but during the programme there is no fierce rush towards the end, no leaps to the distance, just a dreamy, smooth break of time and gravity.
It's as close to Zen space as the Olympics can get.
Women's qualifying competitions and then the finals will be held on Friday afternoon at 1:00 (ET), men's competitions will also be held on Saturday at 1:00.
NBC will send the finals as part of its afternoon software starting at 14 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic drug, they offer a quiet, charming moment that most likely will not be noticed in general chaos.
And if awareness is only achieved by offering male athletes to be stared at and objectified (as recently suggested by US male gymnasts according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his sighing new fan base.
In Ethiopia, a long-standing ally of the United States of America, the generation is demonstrating its mind.
Violent demonstrations in Ethiopia
The protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say that dozens of protesters have been shot to death in clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking?
Over the last decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West, with a rapidly growing economy.
In recent months, however, protests against the government have shaken the country as they spread to more and more regions.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed into the streets demanding a radical political change.
According to human rights groups, the government's response was ruthless.
Witnesses said that the police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
Spreading videos recorded in demonstrations, believed to be at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year, show how the security authorities beat young people with sticks while they were forced to stand up against the wall with their hands.
The United Nations Chief Human Rights Authority is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It was always difficult to keep this country together, and it will be even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, Project Manager of the Horn of Africa in the International Crisis Group.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa, and the West appreciates its stability.
American military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, particularly in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives that much help from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved extremely much, and the capital Addis Ababa even has a new commuter train.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy, human rights organisations have been constantly talking about government repression, the opposition in that country has been limited and dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But this could be changing.
"If you suppress people and they have no choice but to show their minds, this is what will happen," said Seyoum Testome, a university teacher from Central Ethiopia.
The entire youth is demonstrating.
One generation is protesting.
The complaints are diverse and cover all the power of the coalition ruling over land use in the grip of strangulation.
After the much criticised elections last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat held by the opposition, and now it holds all the seats in this House.
At the same time, tensions on the border with Eritrea are increasing, and the battle over this tight and controversial border took hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have more or less been defeated in recent years, can try to exploit the turmoil and re-arm themselves.
Numerous factors explain why, after years of turmoil, bitter feelings are now exploding.
The first seems seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last few years has a large number of Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more common and the internet service has improved.
Even if the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate through hidden network proxy servers.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they met for demonstrations.
Secondly, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia, the Oreos and Amharas, get along better.
Oromos and amharas are not natural allies.
For a very long time, Amharas, who come mainly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, prospered in politics and business, taking advantage of ormos, many of whom are Muslims and who live in the lowlands.
But this, too, is changing.
"We are on our way to organizing under one umbrella," said Oromo Director Mulatu Gemechu.
The largest demonstrations have been in amhara and oromo-regions.
Many amharas and Oromats believe that Ethiopia is ruled unfairly by the Tigre people, which account for about 6% of the population and dominates the armed forces, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenaw.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly qualified to observe early signs of discontent and to use secret ambassadors to make opponents harmless.
"The modern administration has no such basic instinct," said conflict analyst Abdi.
The new Ethiopian Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked up relatively unknown to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say that Tigre-controlled security services don't trust him.
Many fear that this can lead to increased bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia was in such a turmoil in 2005 when thousands of protested about the elections, which, according to analysts, seemed to the government to have lost sight of them and then robbed them.
In the ensuing intensive attack, many protesters died, albeit less than in recent months, and that period of anxiety passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their considerable progress in the fight against poverty.
But clearly this has not stopped the growing contempt for the Ethiopian government within the country.
And now it's starting to take a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month protesters in the Amhara city of Gondari attacked tigre-owned companies, and antitigre hatred becomes increasingly common in social media.
Analysts say that demonstrations place the United States and other Western allies in a clumsy position.
The American Government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights to neighbouring Somalia, even though it recently said it closed this base.
Although the Western countries clearly want to support democracy, they also do not want their allies in an already unstable region to collapse.
"This," Abdi said, "there is real balancing."
Donald Trump explains his Obama-based Father's claim to "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to suppress the dispute over his latest campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he repeatedly insisted this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The investigation raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to communicate clearly with the American public.
It also placed his defenders, who have struggled to defend him during a stormy period, in a difficult position where they have to explain remarks that he does not necessarily mean.
After the insinuation at the campaign meeting on Wednesday evening, Trump argued the same with increasing enthusiasm during Thursday's interviews, where he insisted that his intention was indeed to say that the President and Clinton created ISIS.
However, in an early Friday morning Twitter release, Trump said that he was only being sarcastic.
The publication was a turnaround from the previous day when Trump said in several interviews that he was indeed serious about the accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his remarks by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate took this into his hearing ears.
The most recent review storm comes in a situation where Trump has tried to re-focus his campaign in the midst of the results of the polls that are counting on the economy.
Trump and Clinton fought to talk about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back to the subject again.
Running again to Twitter, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he thought the speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm defense before.
Late in July, when he faced wide criticism, apparently suggesting that the Russians should hack Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his comments by saying "I guess I'm being sarcastic."
This approach will enable Trump to go to the limits of political speech and then to come back if necessary.
"I think it's a model in which he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He looks at how they work and then 'clears' in one direction or another depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think that he is cunning about his statements and knows that they are vague enough to filter them through several different lenses.
Instead of softening his speech for a large voter, Trump has been even more bland in recent days as his popularity has continued to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey published on Friday showed that Trump is following Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
Although Trump tends to avoid apologies for provocative things he says, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words or for misinterpreting his sense of humor.
As he faces ever closer scrutiny during the last few months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have forced his loyal allies into an uncomfortable position where they must publicly support him, no matter how provocative his remarks are.
The former mayor of New York, Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump's most prominent supporters, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I believe there are real political comments in his words," said Giuliani, when he was asked about the veracity of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded an Islamic state.
It is true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organization he called an amateur, completely wrong, and that is why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama government, in which Clinton worked as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to get worse because it failed effectively to deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Before the meetings on Friday in Pennsylvania, Trump continued on Twitter to attack the news media that grind his every word and are biased against him.
He mocked "bad, pathetic" television experts trying to figure out who he was, saying, "They're not gonna make it!"
Some Democrats mocked Trump's excuse for new evidence that he was unfit for president.
Previously closed café returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby, cash-accepting place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network but offered good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the street side of Bedford Avenue was too expensive for it.
The store that replaced Verbi in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
The locals lamented it as the latest loss in a middle - class city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is crushed and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is about change, it's about reinventing.
Last November, the restored Verb opened up to Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verb has a wifi and can be paid with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and there is the same unambitious atmosphere.
Coffee's still good, too.
The new Verb is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old café, who is the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started in the Verb in 2001, and was there until the end.
When the client offered to finance him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things as they were.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought a similar espresso machine.
It even used the lights of old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try it too.
He brought new ingredients.
There are bacon and chicken cheese sandwiches on the menu, and there are some capers and brown onions on the coatings.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
They don't serve beer in the cafeteria anymore, but they make fresh juices.
In nine months, Rodriguez says he's noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
"Williamsburg was too expensive for many former customers," he said.
One Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was a customer like this.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited Verb regularly.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he walked into a coffee shop.
He says that when Verb closed down, he gave up his coffee for a while.
"I realized that I enjoyed Verb's coffee and culture," he said.
Now he has returned to coffee, although that day he ordered a mixed chai drink instead of his usual iced coffee, which is one of the new additions.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, visited Verb faithfully since 2003.
He used to go there before work, and he always made the same order.
"Every day fifteen past seven, regular as a clock, I went in and they were preparing my spicy bagels with butter," he said.
Photograph. Rodriguez said he wanted to do experiments and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes his usual order, but sometimes because of variety, he orders a spicy bagel with bacon, eggs and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn't hold a grudge against the soap store that took over the old premises.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb, which would be used as an ingredient in the cold-extracted coffee from the café.
"I think we can still take the offer," Rodriguez said.
And Greenpoint's traditional Polish residents have also approved the café.
One of these new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said that he was planning to put it on a spot soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice place wants to bottle and sell cold-extracted coffee.
It is possible that the café will expand into the next building.
For many customers, it is enough to have their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular and said he was uncomfortable when the place was closed.
When the new place was opened, Whitt said that he felt like he came home walking in and ordering coffee.
"I wanted to smell it," he said.
A Square Meal: Paralyzing food from the Depression
In March 1933, soon after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to eat lunch in his office.
As a treat, President Roosevelt liked sophisticated Fifth Avenue foods, such as foie gras, and Maryland's swamp turtle soup.
On that day his diet was more modest — stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato sauce, and for dessert from plum pudding.
"It was a sign of culinary solidarity for people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
His spouse, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
The Brooklyn Heights couple are food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, told of Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told of life in Lower East Side through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, published by Harper on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
By showing some sort of culinary solidarity, they meet a journalist at a dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, untraceable lunch bar in the Flatiron region, which has been in operation since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese and olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a serving with turkey, potato sauce and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss eating the Depression.
"Musemies were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut loaf, liverloaf, beansloaf.
They were made from the ingredient and some cheap ingredient that continued the actual ingredient.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to make up your dinner.
Coe was a grotesque.
"It must have felt like lead in the stomach," he said.
In the years before the recession on the American tables, especially in the countryside, it was like eating-so-a-a-a-a-a-and-a-a-and-a-a-and-a-a-b-a-b-a-b-a-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b
Women's groups made food for male farm workers, and fresh pie was served with breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The Americans sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. The A Square Meal chronicles the ways in which the nation survived that it was suddenly no longer a land of abundance.
"At that time food became a central, distressing subject for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The same distressing diet was a new, affordable diet: Mystery foods, such as meatloafs and boxes, became the main foods, and the box was "a wonderful way to use leftovers", said Ziegelman, because chefs were able to hide less attractive ingredients under a creamy sauce layer.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which had been at the center of American meals for years, became a sparing luxury product.
Special compositions were tested with calorie and nutrient content more important than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
Ziegelman prepared an era course in which fried onions were stuffed with peanut butter.
"It was not a popular addition to the dinner table," Coe said.
Ziegelman stated, "It was unreal."
There's no way peanut butter fits into fried sills.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Home Office in 1923-1943, directed the country's eating habits more than ever before or after.
Newspapers and articles in newspapers and magazines encouraged women to become "budgeters" and meet the challenge of turning lumps like pureized spaghetti and carrots into tasty dishes.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical treats.
Especially tasty are reports of government reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's let me eat your cake attitude.
At a time when he publicly praised his childhood as a simple, Iowan country food, he ate such a sophisticated millionaire as he had become.
"He liked continental food like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate a tuxedo in the almost gold-plated dining room.
He was so out of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example on his own stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place that "did not only offer one of Washington's worst, but also the worst prepared food."
Many depressed eating habits were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, said Ziegelman, and how science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that when writing the book, they gained a better understanding of Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, such as how she could not throw away food.
"He was really afraid of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled: "He even made people sick."
There was a wind hat incident.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe brought out the dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt had for lunch.
"It's called plum foam," said Ziegelman, adding that the common trick was to give modest recipes an impressive name.
There was no whipped cream in dessert, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone was reluctant to sink their spoons into a sticky brown chalker.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe did it once and a half.
Sounding like a positive budgeter, he told his wife: "A little bit of chopped walnuts could help."
Gilead will be reimbursed for legal expenses in the hepatitis C patent battle against Merck
The U.S. Court of Appeal has ordered Gilead Sciences Inc to be entitled to the legal costs it incurred in the case of the hepatitis C patient against the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, after breaking two Merck patents related to Gilead's successful medicine Sovald and Harvoni, Gilead was released from $200 million in fees, this release followed when the U.S. judge discovered Merck's abuses, including perjury and other unethical practices.
In a judgment delivered on Thursday, U.S. engagement judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to be released from the compensation it received in the face of an action.
Merck is trying to catch Gilead, which controls the market with a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure well over 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The court case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other for ownership of the laboratory work at the bottom of Gilead's active substance sofosbuvir.
The troops supported by the United States say that they have taken over entirely the Manbij controlled by ISIS.
After the last remaining Isis fighters left the city, the representative of the group said Friday, the entire city of Manbij, near the Turkish border has been taken over by US-supported forces.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last group of fighters who hid in the city left.
The troops had released more than 2,000 civilians who were held captive by the fighters, from the Ally of Sharfan Darwish SDF, the Manbij Military Council, told Reuters.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we have begun to study it," he told Reuters.
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015, cost 34.2% of federal taxes.
On Friday Hillary Clinton published its 2015 tax return, which showed that the income of the Democratic presidential candidate and his spouse in that year was $10.75 million and that their real federal tax rate was 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charitable organizations, mainly the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton made almost $5.3 million in speaking compensation, and the former Foreign Minister announced that he received 3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for his book about his career in the Foreign Office.
Clinton's vice president candidate, Senator Tim Caine from Virginia with his wife Anne Holton, published 10-year tax returns.
Their real federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3%.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set the standard for financial transparency," said Jennifer Palmieri, campaign assistant at Clinton.
As a harsh contrast to this Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and cancels his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is customary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even if the law does not oblige them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the tax administration for an audit as a reason for refusing to publish tax returns.
"Your turn," Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams said on Twitter when publishing a link to the tax returns of the Democratic candidate.
On Thursday, Trump's special assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audits were completed.
Trump's critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said that his refusal raises questions about his capital, his contributions to charity, his business and many other ties to Russia, for example.
Clinton has taken up the problem of publishing an online video on Friday, highlighting visible Republicans who urge Trump to publish his taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the problem in his financial speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate in recent decades has done: published his tax return," he told the public.
Politico has announced that Trump has not paid any or very little taxes in two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist quoted numerous tax lawyers and accountants on Friday who said that the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a problem in the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that those earning over $1 million a year would pay at least 30% of taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At Clinton's meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is located there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said that he also had an audit of the tax administration and that Trump was not "feared" by the tax office, but by the voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
Today, the real federal tax rate of the Clintons in Chappaqua, New York, was about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and their real combined tax rate was about 40.5 percent.
Clinton's 2015 tax return showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment was an affordable index-linked investment fund, and Clinton reported $ 109 000 in dividend and interest income.

Chili powder condoms and firecrackers enhance the protection of Tanzanian elephants
Wildlife conservationists in Tanzania use an unusual method to prevent elephants from wandering into human settlements - throwing animals with condoms filled with chili powder.
The method has proved effective, and several years ago the idea of the Honeyguide Foundation, together with the United States Nature Conservancy, has enhanced its advertising by training volunteers in the villages of North Tanzania to use a four-step non-violent way of protecting homes and crops without the animals being injured.
In the past, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is the world's elephant day dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"From the time we developed the tools...we have seen a change in attitude in these communities. They are now much more confident that they can keep the elephants out of their fields without harming them," said Damian Bell, Executive Director of Honeyguide in the statement.
The first two steps include pointing a flashlight at an intruding elephant and playing a horn.
If it doesn't stop the animal, throw the so-called chilli cloud.
The condom is filled with a mixture of chili powder and ground and a firecracker, followed by a twisting of the condom so that only the fuse is visible.
When a condom is lit, it bursts out with a bang and releases chili powder dust into the air.
One stroke is usually enough to send an elephant in the other direction.
The last resort is the trigger that shoots a Roman candle into the air, and the fireworks produce a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: A Jewish filmmaker criticized a Berlin hotel that removed Israel's territory code at the request of the Arabs
A French filmmaker with Jewish background unleashed a media storm after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's area number. According to the employee, this is due to requests from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Shoah documentary about the Holocaust, unsettled his frustration at the Berlin hotel Kempinski Bristol, writing an open letter in the German FAZ publication.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel's hotel in the country code list.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How can it be that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been removed and erased?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through its own telephone centre.
While searching for explanation, the filmmaker raised the matter at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer that came out of it "stranged him."
The hotel's recipeist said it was a deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski Hotels.
The reason behind the decision was even more shocking to the filmmaker.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel's area code," says the employee, according to Lanzmann.
The Israeli Ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, calls the case "a great injustice", Zuddeutsche Zeitung reports.
"We were horrified and shocked by the incident.
It is a great injustice in itself.
But even greater shame is that this happened in Germany and in this particular hotel chain.
This doesn't need explanations.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident produced quite a reaction online when people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel simply "delivered" to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Damn," said another publication, which pointed out that the hotel on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm street stands near the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly denied all charges and called the incident "unprecise" and "sorry" from Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
"A clear order not to include Israel in the list of quick-choices was never made," says Mr Kempinski's representative, according to Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the area number has now been added.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students who showed their minds.
On Thursday, students met with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when the students met to protest against the reform of the government's public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protestors.
The problems began when law enforcement tried to break up the student group, resulting in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended a demonstration to express their horror at the plans.
According to the proposals made by Governor Paulo Geraldo Alckmin of the State of Sao Paolo, a little less than 100 public schools would be closed and 300 000 pupils would be reinvested in order to save money.
Some of the participants in the demonstration were seen writing graffiti against President Michel Temer on the walls.
This last demonstration took place only days after the protesters started out as a single force to support President Dilma Rousseff, who was suspended from office, when the Senate voted on his charges.
RT Business: Trade between Russia and Iran is suddenly increasing by 71%
Following the removal of sanctions, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, says Russian Ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since the removal of international sanctions against Iran, Russian companies have shown a great deal of interest in business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
"In fact, one of the main objectives of Iran's two-way cooperation is to expand trade", said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, the net sales of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9 % compared to the same period in 2015, amounting to a total of USD 856 million.
Russia's exports to Iran, in particular, increased by 91.5 %, totalling $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to $ 158 million.
"The growth of the market was achieved through the supply of machinery, vehicles and weapons", the Ambassador said.
In addition, this year Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Representative in Iran issued around 35 000 visas to Iranian citizens mainly for travel.
Iran was also for the first time among the 20 countries most visited by tourists in Russia.
"It is safe to say that last year's record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians are visiting Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi. They have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Skotti Callum Skinner jumped to the finish line while the British caught the bike gold.
Scotland's Callum Skinner took credit at the men's team print at Rio's cycling stadium last night when the British team's trio defended his championship from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was an anchor in the role of Sir Chris Roy, his Scottish colleague, in which he excelled, and the legend was proud of the young man when he scored the goal, taking the victory from the New Zealand team.
Britain took the shock victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold.
And they repeated the trick after modestly placing the sixth March race in the World Cup in London, although Hoy has since finished his race.
The problem between the games in Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, a special broadcaster.
This was accomplished just in time for Hindes to show up.
The end of Hoy also created a vacuum that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
Skinner was a man who was held by British coaches in relation to the potential of the Scot that has now been realized.
Hindes, Kenny... who won the championship with Hoy four years ago... and Skinner made an Olympic record in time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
After his own tour, Hindes was close behind, but Kenny pushed the team to lead, and Skinner held on to it.
The strategy change was a big part of the metamorphosis, and it included Hindes driving a bigger gear to slow down and allow Kenny, and Skinner in particular, to hold on to the pace.
Hoy followed his position as BBC expert and drew Skinner, Kenny and Hindes' attention as they entered the podium.
23-year-old Glasgow Skinner said, "The comparison is flattering."
I'm only here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We made an Olympic record at the finals and won the world champions.
It was absolutely incredible.
There can't be a better way to win.
After winning in London in 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a bad start.
He later withdrew his comments, and Britain's competitors have not complained.
This time, there was no such problem as this overpowering victory.
Hindes said, "I felt like I was in London when there were so many British flags on the pedestal."
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply wonderful.
One event, one gold medal for the people who won seven out of ten bicycle races in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we are expected to be successful for five days at the cycling stadium.
Based on Kenny's condition, it is not at all impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat of winning three Olympic gold at one Olympic Games.
That would mean that Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (that seems to be the holy day in British sports, which is also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday) - would rise to six gold and one silver medals.
It would be the same as Hoy.
Kenny's next race is for the sprint, which starts today and lasts for three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I just enjoyed this one.
The team race is always the best.
You win it with your friends.
To be honest, winning alone is lonely."
Hindes said, "If he wins the other two gold medals, he should be given the knight's rank."
This was the only medal contest of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owain Doull were among the fastest in the four-person, four-mile team race.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The world record that won gold in London 2012 is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will take place today, on the second day of the competition, when Wiggins will certainly be the focus of attention.
He had an argument with the judges yesterday before the appointments when the officers invited him for a longitudinal survey.
In a similar women's race, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavien Katie Archibald advanced in world record time at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its great bike team will take over the central part of the Olympic Games and reach a whole series of medals.
After presenting truly extraordinary and complete control in Beijing and London, expectations have been minimized before the Rio Games.
There has been drama, the least of which has not been the separation of the technical director, Shane Sutton, in April due to sexism and temptation charges, and the end of the career of great people such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, on the basis of the first night's competitions at the cycling stadium, it seems that Britain's legendary reputation now peaks at the perfect moment could once again be true.
Portland's Sulphur Future Unquestionable due to the Cutting of the Electricity Agreement
The future of the Portland Victoria aluminium smelter, as well as of hundreds of workers' jobs, is uncertain when the electricity company that distributes electricity to the factory revealed that one of the factory's owners is closing the distribution contract, so it is expected that all distribution contracts will be cut.
The measure follows the Victorian administration's decision earlier this year that the aid required to maintain the plant will not be continued.
The 20-year period of aid will end in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at the Alcoan Portland factory.
Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk, directly or indirectly, with the closure of the factory.
In addition, a snowball effect may be possible, as the melting process uses about 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa shut down Point Henry's melty, which led last year to the closure of the Anglesea power plant.
The Alcoan Portland meltdown is losing money and is under threat of closure.
The operation is now following a series of years of speculation about the future of the factory, which started with a strong Australian dollar and has recently been due to the cost of production.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminium smelter from its Loy Yang An plant in Latrobe Valley, said that it also expects three other owners to conclude their contract.
Most of the plant is owned by Alcoa and Alumina Group, and the Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to operate, which means that the unfrozen physical electricity demand will continue," it said.
According to AGL, the contracts are so-called ‘protection agreements', which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a notice period of 12 months and are therefore effectively terminated in 2017.
"That's why AGL expects the contracts to deliver in the financial year 2017," said the electricity company.
All potential results for AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by the strong outlook of the futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said that it has already 'preceding conclusion' reduced the value of contracts in its accounts by $187 million.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to operate the smelter or to safeguard the power supply of the meltless power".
The US company said that it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 and that the agreement was due to enter into force in November of this year, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew from the agreement.
Analysts have been alert both to the melting of Portland, Victoria, and also to the possible closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, as the economic situation in this sector is poor.
Earlier in the week, Stephen Mikkelsen, CEO of AGL, told analysts that Portland uses approximately 600 megawatts of electricity each year and Tomaso uses about 900 megawatts every year.
‘If both plants exit the market, this is a significant reduction in demand for [electricity] markets.
As an electricity producer, this would not be a good thing for us," he said.
Kendall, not just a Kardashian reality show star, is on the cover of the September Vogue.
Kendall Jenner, model 20, and mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner's fourth daughter, is on the cover of U.S. Vogue's desired September issue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's brand ambassador and was a model at Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Weeks, announced the news on Thursday on his Instagram account.
"Looking at this cover in a room full of loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover release was followed by a unique (or perhaps just suitable for Kardashians style), a handwritten reality video with the whole Kardashian-Jenner clan (excluding problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, and with everyone's favorite entertainment uncle, Ryan Seacrest) forgot the cover of their sister, but ended in a classic twist: they were planning a surprise party.
It's a cliché of almost every children's "birthday" series (Seacrest utters the lines "I guess you didn't think we'd forget you" with the credibility of the morning-drawing bunny fairy), but Kris had to make his other girls somehow benefit from this publicity.
This is because we have certainly moved on to a new era of the Kardashians with the place of Vogue in September.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have reached Vogue's cover first (she shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is quite unique.
Vogue's September issue is the most selling edition of the year.
Its thickness is more like a coffee protocol than a fashion magazine, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion calculated that 615 of last year's 832-page opus was advertising content).
The revelation of its cover star is so much awaited that for the past two years the pictures of the magazine have leaked before the official release.
Previous women on the cover have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangel and Kate Moss.
Indeed, in recent years there have been more 'publics who serve as models' than 'models that are celebrities' on the cover.
The Oscar winner and Dior's ambassador Jennifer Lawrence were on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga's place of honor.
But if it were to happen that Jenner, who is described by the magazine as "the success model" of his generation, would hit the first category mentioned, he is in quite good company.
These celebrities are not relatives or reality stars of famous people or young people today who can make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all this).
They are quite rightly talented women who thrive in the entertainment industry.
Last year's cover model Beyonce has been one of the strongest years of her career since Lemonade's release.
Of course, not everyone is pleased with Jenner's success.
In his reality-TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the moment's bitches".
This feeling surfaced again with Jenner's Vogue deck.
But running around in discontent is irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
He's a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's makeup cream.
He and all his sisters sell you pictures of themselves in their own apps behind the pay-per-view wall.
She's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter she took for the Love magazine.
And in his spare time, possibly just to see his sister Kourtney and her children, he's a reality TV star.
Community legal centres turn away 160 000 people each year
More than 160 000 of the most vulnerable peoples are turned away from the Community's legal centres each year as the sector prepares for the impact of further financial cuts on its already ultra-peripheral activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who do not have the opportunity to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already being turned away as they seek free legal advice and representation.
Legal services already stretched to the limits of the Community are preparing for further cuts.
In June next year, these legal centres are due to lose 30% of their federal funding.
James Farrell, head of the legal centres of the Queensland Community, said that the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres report shows that thousands of people are already being turned away annually.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not withdrawn, the situation will only get worse.
"The legal centres of the Queensland Community are chronically underfunded, which means that every year thousands of people are turned away from the essential services they need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships with uncontrolled and crippling debts, separated families, unfairly separated workers - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30% in June 2017, which means that thousands of vulnerable Queensland residents will be forced to navigate in the midst of complex legal problems without assistance.
We appeal to both the Minister of Justice and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately cancel these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the state government made a commitment to raise the funding of legal aid to the level of the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the Community Legal Centre and their customer communities, and the Palaszczuk Government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was brought to justice after the employee was accused of having been gunned down.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly not doing anything after they were told that the head of North Carolina's operation was holding a gun to the employee while driving in the Jeep in February.
The incident was described in an action brought by former state campaign software intern Vincent Bordin in Charlotte, State Court on Wednesday.
My Bordi said that he waited for months for the situation to be dealt with internally before he realized that "it would not happen".
Chief Earl Phillip "put out a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger and shoved a pipe against Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign administration, Bordini heard that at least four other people had had similar experience with Phillip, said in the lawsuit.
"You don't have to fire guns to cause damage," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The challenge comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused anger when he told the public in North Carolina that the "second-up people" - who generally understand the owners and arms enthusiasts - could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and allowed to choose judges.
Trump's campaign said that the media have taken his word out of context and that he is not in favour of violence.
In Bordin's challenge, the campaign will seek compensation for careless supervision and Phillip for violence, assault and emotional shock.
Trump's representative Hope Hicks did not reply to the request for a comment immediately.
The attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news subsidiary in Charlote, reported that Phillip recently left the campaign.
His consulting company's call to Innovative Consulting Services was not answered immediately.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign has been controversial.
The case is Bordi v Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and flourishing throughout the stomach, not just in local communities and across London.
For me, this was the great appeal of Heathrow, just as it was also the appeal of the 2012 London Games, when we worked so hard to ensure that all our peoples and regions would benefit from the Games.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratford and East End.
And we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
10 000 new traineeships and 40 000 new jobs will be created for local communities alone and youth unemployment will be eliminated around the airport.
As before the 2012 London Games, some come to think that the challenge of extending Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the games and that we would be ashamed of ourselves in front of the world.
The skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow will answer every question that is put to it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and an economic growth of GBP 211 billion, leaving the legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has implemented the 11 billion-dollar infrastructure investment programme on time and in budget: T5, which has been voted the world's best airport terminal for five years in a row, T2, which was built between the two world's busiest runways.
Now the team is ready to execute the third runway supported by £16 billion of private money.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for Britain, and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow is also a success.
It is time for us to channel the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, ensure the future of our trade and create a heritage of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of Heathrow Board and former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook in Cat and Mouse to prevent ads
For companies that receive money from online advertising, attempts to bypass advertising programs are "cat and mouse games", said one of the companies that manufacture such a program.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertising inhibitors on its computer pages, Adblock Plus published a blog article that said that users could update the program filters to prevent advertising again on the social network pages.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that the code on its website will be changed around the ads so that it would be more difficult for advertising inhibitors to detect which parts of the page are advertising.
But now Adblock says it's circled a new code.
In a blog article, Adbuck's representative Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of round-the-clock struggle between an open source advertising community and its orbiters has been going on ever since advertising was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will come up with its own solution soon.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has taken part in the battle is a strong indication of how much grief the ad blockers have become to industry.
Worldwide, about 200 million people use ad blockers, reports last year's Pagefair and Adobe study. This is almost fourfold the number that used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now covers 84% of Facebook's advertising revenue.
However, the company is looking for advertising inhibitors on computer pages, as mobile advertising inhibitors do not work on Facebook's mobile apps for a social network or Instagram," the representative said.
Computer ads still generate enough revenue to make Facebook think that this type of activity is worth investing in.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said that it dailyed its ad preference tool to give people more power about how ads are targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adbrock's new filters were worrying because they would also prevent some of the website's non-advertising content.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem," Facebook's representative said in an email statement.
Advertising inhibitors are boring tools, which is why we have focused instead on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
She was hit by a car on a Swiss highway, apparently due to suicide.
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for eyewitnesses after a woman was hit by several vehicles on the highway during the early hours of Thursday in a case that apparently was suicide.
The incident took place on A1 near Morges in Vaud Canton just after midnight on Thursday.
A woman did a "desperational act" and lay in the dark lying on the road where she was hit by several vehicles, said the Vaudi police officer in a statement.
The victim who clearly tried to kill himself was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the event have already been questioned, but not all have yet been identified, said the police, who appeal to them and all witnesses to the incident to report.
A criminal investigation has been initiated, which is a "logic" step in a situation such as this, the lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneva.
"However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
It remains for the prosecutor to decide," Hofstetter said.
The two similar cases of the last five years suggest that drivers are not held responsible.
In both cases - both of which had a person walking on a dark highway - it was estimated that motorists cannot expect to meet a pedestrian on a highway in the middle of the night, said the paper.
Last year, the police were cleared of charges of negligence after he hit and killed a man lying on the A! road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court was told.
The Court found that a police officer who was reacting to an emergency call drove in a justified way and that the man's presence on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation", the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus was likely to be inhabited once.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to find out if there could sometimes have been earthlike conditions in Venus with its hot, anhydrous surfaces and an atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earthlike atmosphere and still could have rolled slowly.
The model also examined the surface formation of early Venus.
The planet probably had areas drier than Earth, but there was once enough water and geographical variation to make life possible and protect from rapid water evaporation.
Early Venus also had the advantage of being 30 percent dimmer than the sun.
"In the simulation of GISS's model, the slow rotation of Venus reveals its side of the day to the sun for almost two months at a time," explained Anthony Del Genio, researcher of GISS in the news release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of cloud that acts as an umbrella to protect the surface from much of the sun's heat.
As a result, the average climate temperatures are actually a few degrees cooler than the Earth's current temperatures.
The model produced a story of Venus' evolution, similar to what the planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was likely once habitable, it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapors burned in ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, all that remained was a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere with deadly greenhouse gas phenomena - Venus, which we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy gives up the job of Avalanche's coach.
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday from the activities of Colorado Avalanche's coach and vice president of hockey affairs, saying that it was a lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
Vice President/President of Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed the information and mentioned that the team will start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have done my duty as vice president and head coach of Colorado Avalanche hockey affairs with enthusiasm, passion and determination," said Roy, age 50.
During the summer, I have thought long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the coach and the Deputy Director-General for hockey must be fully in line with the organisation's view.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not being met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and wish him well in the future.
Roy was named the winner of the Jack Adams Award for the best coach in the league during his first season in Avalanche in 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and the middle division victory, but Minnesota knocked down Colorado in the first round of the playoffs, and the team hasn't been able to continue in the last two years.
Avalanche games in the season 2015-16 ended in 39 wins, 39 wins and 4 draws, and the team lost five points to Wilde, losing the Wild Card playoff spot at the Western Conference.

North Sea oil workers continue negotiations and postpone strike
The labour battles of North Sea oil workers for pay are postponed when all the parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, said the leading negotiators.
Strikes against the oilfield service company Wood Group have been arranged randomly on North Sea drilling platforms run by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT federations can confirm that we have agreed to resume the process of resolving the current dispute", said the joint opinion.
Over the next few weeks, we will be holding several full-day meetings starting early next week so that we can take a fresh look at the problems.
According to trade unions, their recent industrial action, which they claim to be the first in more than 25 years, was an objection to possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
This year, Wood Group cut the North Sea contractors' fees by around 9% due to negative market pressure.
The company's fee reduction will result in a 10 per cent reduction in 2014 for contractors in its countries.
The company said that further cuts would provide the company with the necessary space to cope with the downturn in the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut thousands of people off their payrolls and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries when the company lightens its operations as a result of its massive fusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by Britain's decision to leave the European Union in June.
Earlier this week, Scottish MEP Dave Anderson met with federal leaders to discuss one of the largest North Sea labour disputes of the generation.
He said that the North Sea was essential to the region's economy.
"We need an economy that works for many, and not just for a few, both in the North Sea and in the whole country," he said in the opinion.
In 2016, less than USD 1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new projects in the North Sea, while the average for the previous five years has been around USD 7 billion.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of the stars in the Plejad star group
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete listing of the Plejades' star cluster's speed of rotation.
New information helps astronomers to understand why the stars of the star group rotate at varying speeds and how the orbiting times are related to planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star groups, we will now learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, researcher at the Pasadena Centre for Infrared Processing and Analysis in the press release.
The Plejades starbase is 445 light years away from Earth.
Many of the stars of the crowd have been born some 125 million years ago, and are about to reach adulthood right now.
They're spinning at their top level now.
At its peak speed, these growing stars will plunge large amounts of starwind.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they slow down the stars.
As the star grows old, its speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by following the appearance of identifiable stars, such as sunspots.
The latest list of rotational speeds suggests that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to the dancers, the bigger ones making the devils slower than the smaller ones.
"In the "balet" of the plejades we see that the slow spinrs are usually more massive, while the fastest spinrs are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Since the Plejades' star array is so close, it is the ideal cosmic laboratory for assessing star characteristics at rotational speeds.
"The Plejades' starbase provides an anchor for the rotation of stars into theoretical models of both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, because and why stars slow down their rotational speed and so to speak, hang their ‘dance shoes' on a nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of the speed of rotation of the Plejades in three articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
