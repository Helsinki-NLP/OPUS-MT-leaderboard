A 9-year-old boy on the run in Tampere was found.
The police have had a search mission on account of a nine-year-old boy's escape in Tampere on Tuesday evening.
A missing persons report on a boy who left West Tampere with a friend has spread on social media.
According to the police situation center, the boy has been contacted and has no danger to his life or health.
The boy's father told the Evening Sanomat at midnight knowing that the boy had been found.
He's fine, and now we're going to start the after-shaves.
The boy was found near the home, Dad told me.
Ronaldo, on the other hand, he's tearing the paint gap into Messi.
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league this weekend and continued his production in the Champions League as well.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo over the goal king of the Champions League turned at least for a moment in favor of the latter.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo went to the top of all-time scorer statistics when he shot the visitor Shahtar Donetsk's network with two hits on the penalty kicks and one on the game situation.
Ronaldo raised his goal balance to 80 when before Tuesday the Barcelona Messi, who was evenly read with him, had 77 hits.
Real won 4-0.
Juventus has stumbled in Italy's football league in Serie A from the beginning, but in the Champions League D section it started powerfully with a 2-1 visitor victory from Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored over ten minutes before the end of Juventus' Alvaro Morata.
City's attack was blunted by the absence of the knee-rugged Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in this weekend's champion league game, didn't come to the airport until the last ten minutes.
Manchester's second club, United, also experienced a tough time against PSV Endhoven in Holland after having suffered a 1-2 loss.
ManU's 20-year-old wingman Luke Shaw's guest fight lasted only 15 minutes.
The dangerous-looking slide tackle of PSV Hector Moreno hit the target with a ManU pack so badly that Shaw likely broke his tibia.
Shaw was lying on the lawn of Eindhoven's home stadium about ten minutes before medical personnel left to transport him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests to the 1-0 lead by 41 minutes, but ManU's pleasure lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno evened out before the break in extra time.
The PSV's winning goal was scored at the second half by Luciano Narsingh.
In the Champions League of the Marching Age, Paris Saint-Germain began the A-section.
It had been replaced by Angel Di Maria of Argentina, who changed Manchester United's shirt to a PSG nut.
Di Maria broke through the right hand and lifted the ball past the mantelpiece, Johan Wiland, the goalkeeper of Malmö.
Edinson Cavani made 2-0 for the second half of PSG.
PSG has been put on the team of season's winners.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of the league's small clubs, is not the best possible benchmark.
The PSG's star attacker Zlatan Ibrahimovic first encountered his professional career as his starting partner in Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played for 90 minutes when his team in Moscow's TsKA lost to Wolfsburg 0-1 in Section B in Germany.
The opposition party demanded immediate resignation - the president gave the wrong speech
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has given the same speech in the parliament that he gave at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether 91-year-old Mugabe was in full power.
The main opposition party, MDC, insisted that Mugabe resign because he is too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants rushed to say that the confusion had taken place only at Mugabe's headquarters and that the President had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech addressed earlier and now China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an extraordinary summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have proposed an additional summit of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President-in-Office of the European Council, will assess this request.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, state leaders should discuss cooperation with countries of origin and how to better register those who come to Europe.
The negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are, according to Merkel, part of the Home Secretary's table.
The teacher admits to shooting her girlfriend during an emergency call.
The voice is only slightly coloring the university teacher Shannon Lamb will tell the police during the emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that the police have to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "golden dog" is alive and probably upset, and said that the contact details of the dead woman's family are found on his phone.
Inside the house the police found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten note on the page of the booklet: "I'm so sorry that I could cancel this I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me," said a letter that experts said was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Cleveland Delta State University in Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometers to a school campus where the police believe that he shot and killed Ethan Schmidt, the beloved history teacher, at the door of this office.
Police Chief Lynn Buford of Delta State University told me that the university staff heard a shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said that Lamb made a fatal 911 call some time after that.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths rose by one more: Lamb committed suicide while the police surrounded the mouth.
Authorities were still trying to find out Lamb's motive the day after students and staff had to hide behind locked doors due to school shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have made public information that students and staff described Lamb as a talented teacher, yet possibly having problems.
The students said they'd been waiting for her hours.
The police in the Prentiss area, Gautier, say that Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in his book, in which he thanked the "mighty people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 staff members, and many of the students participated in both men's courses.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb, but said he also seemed nervous and restless, "as if something was wrong."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told her that she was under a lot of stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously requested sick leave from Delta State University, saying that he had some kind of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's payroll policy meant that while Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it did not guarantee him automatic career development and assistant professorship.
The university principal William LaForge said that, as far as he knew, there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that " clearly there was something in Lamb's mind".
These are the questions Lamb is no longer able to answer.
After Lamb escaped campus, the police got to him when he moved back to Mississippi from the state of Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County coroner Methel Johnson.
Lamb's car was still running in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this very house, even though Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the University in 2009 and taught geography and education. The university has 3500 students and is located in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb completed his doctorate in pedagogy in spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic, and funny.
Carla Hairston told me she was 15 years old and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who tried to teach Hairston how to play guitar for many years.
He was quite a charmer back then.
All the girls were melted wax when he was there, now told by 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in the suburbs of Jackson, Brandon.
Apparently Lamb and Prentiss had been dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb told me he killed his wife, but there's no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them at the riverside brick house in Gautier.
The police told me the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen told me they broke up 15 years ago, but they stayed friends, and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really upset," O'Steen described his daughter.
He was his mother's best friend.
O'Steen told me that he had not met Lamb, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both performing on the summer market three years ago.
Later, they played a few gigs together.
O'Steen told me that his daughter does and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several online companies.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and occasional entertainment organizer of The Julep Room, near Gautier, said that he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, when Lamb had finished his performance of guitar and harmonica for a few audiences.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were messing with each other and throwing snorts at each other.
So they were both quite clever.
Dead teacher Schmidt ran a first-year seminar programme for students and was specialized in Indians and colonial history," said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the school.
Schmidt was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was chairman of his brotherhood and student government.
On Tuesday night in Cleveland, Delta State campus, there was a candle-drinking, attended by about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students and community members.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended Mass, during which the University Choir sang the songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The lesson continues on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis are reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Pettus from Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana from New Orleans participated in the report.
The case has been corrected according to the fact that the police now say that Lamb made an emergency call after Schmidt was shot and that while Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the holiday season
Toys R Us says that it does not hire as many employees for the holiday season as it did last year, but the dealer of toys and baby products says that current regular and seasonal workers are given the opportunity to do more hours.
According to the company, it plans to employ 40 000 people to work in shops and distribution centres across the country, compared with 45 000 employees in the 2014 holiday period.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that interviews with applicants will start this month, and the number of staff will rise from October to December.
Although the holiday season is months away, the Christmas shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help with the occupation of shops and the sale, dispatch and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his date with Princess Diana.
The premiere of the "Back to the Future" film was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also noteworthy for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the royals to arrive, and I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana's place was next to me," she said in the future documentary film Back in Time's trailer.
The movie starts and I think I'm just a fake yawn and a hand stretch away from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and production director Steven Spielberg.
The return to the future was premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg told me, "I'm sure it's the greatest time travel movie of all time."
Back in Time is available as video subscriptions, DVDs and some cinemas in October.
The UN leader says that the situation in Syria will not be resolved with arms.
The response of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to Russia's increased military support for Syria is that this almost five-year conflict "will not be resolved in an armed manner" and additional weapons will only exacerbate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN leader again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support any non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Ban announced that he was going to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent Member States - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - in connection with the ministerial week of the General Assembly later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and regional forces "has made the situation impossible to resolve".
Ban called on five permanent Member States to show the solidarity and consensus they showed when dealing with the Syrian crisis when they agreed on Iran's nuclear programme.
8 support polls that show Donald Trump is serious
Some have tried to label him as a windquill.
Some people think he's just a joke.
Some of them are waiting for the crash.
Although some Republicans have tried to get Donald Trump off the top of the polls, it has not (yet) succeeded.
Of the last 11 national surveys, ten Donald Trump has been in charge in a two-digit number, and some have begun to seriously consider what this means in terms of the ability to appoint a real estate king.
Of course, the parliamentary term is still at an early stage.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to be a Republican candidate.
The commentators point out that, at this stage in 2011, Rick Perry was losing leadership over the rising Herman Cain, both of whom did not get a single state in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in general elections.
However, external groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Union Club for Growth have noted Trump's tenacity and have begun to use its resources to overthrow him.
The following recent support polls suggest that the real estate king is not just a passing phase:
Trump's popularity figures have turned around.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, the Monmouth University polls showed that only two out of ten Republicans welcomed the real estate king.
By mid-July the figure was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
At the moment, six out of ten Republicans welcome Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they are negative.
These figures are also true in the first primary states.
In a poll conducted by the University of Quinnipiac in Iowa last week, 60% of the Republicans reported that they welcomed Trump.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be happy if Trump became a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC survey last week, 67% of the Republicans said that they would either be "inspired" or "satisfied" if Trump were a candidate.
Only two out of ten said that they would be "shocked" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson produces about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% "inspired" versus 40% of Trump).
What's the next most exciting?
Marco Rubio's only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters would be "unsatisfied" or "shocked" if Jeb Bush, who is a favorite of the authorities, became a candidate.
Trump's fiery nature is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trump has been widely criticised for his pompous speeches and insults, according to Monday's ABC News/Washington Post poll, 52% of voters on the Republican side at national level feel that the real estate king has the right character for the president.
According to a survey by Quinnipiac last week, in the state of Iowa holding the first party assembly, the figure is the same: 52 percent of the Republicans think Trump has the right character for the leader.
However, according to the ABC/Post survey, 44% feel that his character is not suitable for acting as president, and almost six out of ten feel that his character is not part of the White House.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is a real option.
According to the CNN/ORC survey, four out of ten considered Trump the most likely option when asked who would most likely be nominated as a Republican candidate.
At the end of July, four out of ten were still in favour of Jeb Bush.
Release of information: Republican voters have not always had the brightest crystal ball at their disposal.
During the last parliamentary term, four out of ten Republicans believed that Rick Perry would be nominated and only 28% supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that most Republican voters believe Trump's campaign to be credible.
Even if Republicans were to stand up for another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmented field is likely to have contributed to Trump's leadership, as the support against Trump has been divided among many other candidates.
However, a survey conducted by Monmouth University in early September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump receives majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's tied up with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to win Trump?
If they were set against each other, Ben Carson would win a businessman Trump with a huge 18-point difference.
The majority of Donald Trump's supporters have just told us that they have made a decision.
A new CBS/NYT survey on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters in favour of Trump have decided who to vote for.
Of course, things can change, and no one can say for sure that they will never change their mind.
Forty-six percent said they might be able to change candidates.
In any case, Trump's biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they had made a decision are twice as likely to be on Trump's side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his campaign launch speech, immigration has been at the heart of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump's pompousness will drive Latino voters away from the Republican Party and harm the attempts to rebrand.
According to a new ABC/Post survey published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the heart of things, so is Donald Trump.
Frustration in the government has reached a new peak.
The support for Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of the Republican voters, largely because of their position outside politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said in the ABC/Post survey on Monday that they prefer to choose a non-political person rather than someone with government experience.
They're also angry with the federal government.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg two weeks ago in Iowa showed that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54% are "unsatisfied" and 21% "really angry".
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first appearance at Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election.
Jeremy Corby, the new Labour Labour leader, will meet David Cameron for the first time at Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corby will rise to ask his first six questions shortly after noon, and it is likely that both the media and the Labour Members will be very vigilant in his performance.
Corbyn has demanded "less theater and more facts" for this weekly performance.
He has also said that he could leave some of the opportunities to his colleagues.
This meeting is the first parliamentary test for the leadership of Corbyn since he was appointed to the shadow government and spoke at the annual meeting of the Confederation of Trade Unions on Tuesday.
At the same time, the Labour Party leader's decision to stand quietly during the national anthem during Tuesday's memorial service on the 75th anniversary of the Battle from Britain has raised criticism among Conservative Party MPs and appeared in several front page cases.
Corbyn's decision not to sing a national anthem has attracted attention.
Corbyn's representative said that he "stood with respect quietly" and that he acknowledged "the courage of the Royal Air Force in the British Air War."
Owen Smith, a member of Corbyn's shadow government, said to the BBC Two Newsnight that he would have invited the Labour leader to sing the national anthem despite the fact that he felt that the Royal House should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to participate in Corbyn's inner circle, arguing for disagreements in economic, defence and foreign affairs, initially supported by less than one sixth of the parliamentary party as a leader.
The BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant says that the differences in policy regarding the role of the party in the European Union and the government's aid ceiling have also "crowded" within the Labour Party since Corbyn was appointed.
At the meeting of the Confederation of Trade Unions, Corbyn said that the Labour Party would propose a change that would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, the shadow government secretary Smith said that the party was "very clear" about their only opposition to the government's plans to lower the ceiling from £26,000 to £230,000.
Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Labour Party, whom David Cameron has encountered in the last decade when he has been the leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the Labour Party has promised a new approach to politics and now tells us that he has "stamped" ideas for questions to the Prime Minister and has received over 30 000 proposals.
Mr Corbyn, a representative of the Islington North region, has said that the nature of the Prime Minister's Question Time is too contrasting and that he intends to refrain from both clever rhetoric and thorny, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Corbyn has said that the finance secretary of the shadow government, Angela Eagle, is his substitute for Question Time when Corbyn does not participate - for example when Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corbyn has also proposed that other colleagues should be allowed to speak at times, and he has said that he has approached the President of the House of Commons, John Bercowi, on the subject.
When Cameron took the lead in 2005, he said he wanted to move further away from a political theatre that was often linked to Prime Minister's Question Time, but later he had to admit that he had failed.
Since they began to be televised in 1990, Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important measure in assessing the Director's judgment, his control of the House of Commons, and his position with other MPs, even though critics have criticised Question Time for becoming nothing more than a travesty requiring far-reaching reforms.
Photographed in Joburg: Homeless young people are trained as photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and make a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio where homeless young people are taught how to take photos of their neighborhood and profit from it.
BBC News met one of the first young people to graduate from the project.

The value of the pound is rising as wage growth in Great Britain accelerates
The value of the pound jumped up after the numbers showed an increase in the UK's wage growth, while the FTSE 100 index rose with the offer item SABMiller.
Between May and July, UK wages, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
The rate of growth was fastest since 2009 and was considered to bring estimates of the increase in rates.
The pound rose by more than 1% against USD 1.5505 and 0.84% against EUR 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% up to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most distinctive share in the market and increased by 20 % after a competitor AB InBev approached it with an offer.
The agreement would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's stock rose by 0.9 percent after encouraging news from the competing luxury product group Richmont.
Richemont's latest sales figures were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in China - which is the key market for Burberry - had started to grow again.
Glencore's shares increased by 5 percent after the mine giant reported that it had raised $2.5 billion by issuing shares as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The packaging and paper group Mondi's shares were among the largest calculators in the index by 4.3 per cent after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation to ‘sale'.
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sportswear company announced its six-month return before tax: an 83% increase to GBP 46,6 million.
According to the director of JD Sports, higher wages can harm enlargement
Peter Cowgill, director of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage for workers is increased in the UK, it may mean that "the purchasing power of potential consumers will increase".
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs for the company," Cowgill notes.
The costs could be related to the company's expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash is launching a grass-roots campaign against Aldi's invasion.
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA stores from Aldi's attack in South and West Australia.
The food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grass-roots campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in South and West Australia before Aldin's $700 million attack.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first store early next year to South and West Australia, where there will be up to 120 stores. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food intermediaries and build the IGA brand through the marketing of mainstream and social media, as well as through events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA's traders and buyers have jumped in, and brands like Simmo's, an ice cream manufacturer from Dunsborough, offer a sample of IGA's stores, and store owners sell discount tickets to Australian football matches to their regular customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on 29 September when this food, alcohol and hardware wholesaler organises an annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake, as South and West Australia together account for almost 30% of the area of Metcash's IGA stores, with higher profit margins than the IGA network in the Eastern states of Metcash.
The buyers of South and West Australia are known to be roundabout, and IGA retailers have a much higher market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: over 30% in the South and 24% in the West compared to 14% in Eastern countries.
Analysts like Morgan Stanley believe, however, that Aldi will catch about 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening up the first stores.
In this week's report, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA dealers could lose $360 million a year for sale and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year Aldi will open 25 stores in the south and 30 stores in the west, which will generate $500 million and $600 million in turnover in these areas.
The loss of food and food sales and quantities at Metcash's high fixed costs base can cost Metcash some $13 million in operating profit losses before interest and taxes," Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA's customers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food and food sales will fall by 3.8% in 2016; 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, with its market share falling from 14 % in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, the manager of the leading investment fund and founder of the Magellan Financial Group, said at business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "very possibly lose in a decade".
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglass' comments.
However, it has been understood that a member of Metcash's board of directors would have contacted Douglass last week.
Since 2010, IGA's market share has fallen from 18% to 14%, and the income from Metcash's food and food business, which delivers around 1200 products to the IGA dealer, has decreased by 43% since 2012, which shows a reduction in debt financing for operations when sales and margins are under pressure.
However, the wholesaler stands up and has invested more than $150 million each year in reducing the prices of hundreds of products weekly to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA dealers to renovate the stores by adding faster-growing fresh food, and bringing a better range of private brand products to the market.
Metcash's Director General, Ian Morrice, says that lowering prices and improving stores has increased attractiveness and hopes that the wholesaler will return to the path of profit growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Steve Healy, president of the Australian tennis union, supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves credit rather than criticism for his conduct
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered collateral damage in a recent storm that has raged around his friend Nick Kyrgios. He deserves credit rather than criticism for his own conduct," says Steve Healy, president of the Australian tennis union.
Mr Kokkinakis, the younger member of the talented duo called "Special Ks", was unwittingly exposed to the case of Mr Kyrgios who provoked Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters competition.
Shortly thereafter, in a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati, the chief judge had to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice when Harrison declared: "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten that brat."
Although Kokkinakis was last seen breaking his bat after the cramp ruined his potential victory over Richard Gasquet in the US Open, Healy has been the staunch defender of Kokkinakis.
Right now, a young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth for a second place in a double match with Bernard Tomic at the Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
"I'm pretty strongly of the opinion that Thanasi's just been dragged into a brawl," Healy said.
He broke his bat when he lost the cramp in US Open, but he's not the first player to break his bat in frustration, and I know Thanas well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But he has behaved very well, including in quite provocative situations in the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little harshly.
He's very mature for 19 years, he works hard, fits in with the team and so on, and he's never had any problems with other players. He's appreciated in the locker room, he's training hard, he's in good shape and he's a very calm and mature young man, and I think he should be judged according to his merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to include Kyrgio in the important games starting on Friday, describing this "common decision" as a good solution for all, but still supporting the return of the Canberran to the regulars of the team.
"We want the team to be fully focused on the games and not all the polemic around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen really fast, as Federer and Murray, for example, have pointed out, and he is growing up in the public eye, and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has received. However, we are trying to support him, we are trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe it is best for both the team and for him if he spends some time out of the public thinking about these consequences.
European immigration crisis: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border with Serbia, arresting those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim of damging the flow of migrants entering the country.
There was chaos at the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in neutral territory, and the Serbian authorities reacted with dismay.
The people who fled from violence in their countries have now set up their tents and set themselves on an undefined stretch of road between inspection posts in two countries.
But frustration grew.
While the police helicopter was standing above them, immigrants kept saying "Open the border!" shouting insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water as a protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared that it would be 'impossible to accept' the return of migrants from Hungary as more and more of them arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not to harm civilians.
The debate will have to take place in the next few days with other countries and Brussels," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The confusion on the Hungarian-Serbia border arose after the 28-national faction failed to establish a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the division of 40,000 asylum seekers who have now taken over Italy and Greece, and they were hopeful that a final agreement would be reached - by next month or the end of next year - on which EU countries would take 120 000 additional refugees, including part of Hungary.
Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria are calling for an extra EU summit on Tuesday to discuss the continent's migration crisis.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will act soon.
Tuesday's emergency in two southern regions gave the authorities greater powers to act in a crisis and made it possible for you to be closed and for asylum cases to be speeded up.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence on the Serbian border is ready, the country is also going to set up its border with the barbed wire fence against Romania in order to stop the influx of immigrants across the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the largest bottleneck and the point of entry into the European Union for refugees, many of whom are fleeing war from Syria and the rest of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that most of the arrivals are economic refugees in search of a better life, and not those fleeing from war who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly in conflict with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now define an attempt to cross or damage a four-metre barbed wire fence (13 feet) built by the government on the southern border with Serbia and include longer prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"In view of the situation caused by immigration, the Hungarian Government declares an emergency situation", the government's spokesman, Zoltan Kovacs, told journalists in the Szeged city of the south.
We are very clear on this: Illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Parliament still has to formally approve the military deployment expected for next week, but the Associated Press journalists at the border have seen for days heavy armed military personnel with their vehicles and dogs.
The Orban National Security Advisor, Gyorgy Bakondi, said that 45 people had been caught by the authorities in their attempt to cross the border and 15 more countries.
They got over by damaging the fence, are now incarcerated by the police, and they are accused of violations as defined in the new laws.
The authorities will fix the fence quickly.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossing points on the border with Serbia after sending a barbed - wire train wagon to close one of these places.
The main crossing point near Roszke in Hungary was covered in chaos when Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for handling people and crowds tried to enter.
About 20 got in, but thousands were left out.
A group of immigrants blocked the main motorway between Serbia and Hungary, saying that they refuse food and drink until they are allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 elections: According to a national survey, Hillary Clinton's leadership in Bernie Sanders has narrowed by half.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will continue in double-digit leadership in the Democratic nomination contest, but Senator Bernie Sanders has caught up with him.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of the Democratic electorate (calculated from 58%), while the second is supported by 27% (reduced from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he is going to the presidential race, but he is supported by 15% of the Democratic electorate.
More than five months before the start of the primary election, the majority of democratic voters state that it is still too early to say that they would have decided who to vote for.
However, Clinton's supporters stand behind their own choice more firmly than those of other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has fallen among several population groups since last month's CBS News Poll survey, while Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is strongly in charge of women and moderates, but his leadership has narrowed.
His popularity among men has decreased considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's head start with the democratic voters under the age of 50 has disappeared, and he is now even with Sanders.
Clinton, however, is clearly leading with the older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders in a double-digit number among liberals, but now Sanders is leading this group by five percentage points.
About half of the country's democratists say that they will be very supportive of Clinton if he becomes a candidate for the party.
A quarter says that they support him with certain reservations, and 15% would support him simply because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support him at all.
It is not very surprising that Clinton's current supporters are very likely to be eager to support him.
Opinions are more confusing for those who are not currently in favour of Clinton - only a quarter would be eager to support him.
While 48 percent of the Democratic voters say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the Republicans' number one man, Donald Trump, says the same thing by fewer Republican voters (35%).
When people asked Clinton's supporters why they wanted him to be a candidate in an open question, the most popular answer was that he had the appropriate experience (16%) and then the most popular answers were that now is the time for the female president (13%) and that he is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Since the vice president has an influence on the possible presidential candidacy, 57% of democratic voters would like to see him already in the race - even though one third disagree.
When asked by democratic voters who they would choose second for the party's nomination, Biden is the most popular choice.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half say they would choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to go for the Democratic candidacy, Hilary Clinton's leadership from Sanders will increase. If Biden goes with us, the lead will be 20 percentage points, but if she does not, the figure is 30.
55% of democratic voters believe that Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
By this standard Biden remains far away, but the proportion of those who consider him to be the most voting has increased.
When asked what was most important in the candidate, however, the democratic voters put their opinions before the vote.
Last month, too, no candidate or candidate for democracy was considered to be an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are doing well on certain key issues among their party voters.
Most people consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden is best at the trio in honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of democratic voters say that Clinton is not honest and reliable, which is twice as much as Sanders (15%), but 27% say they do not have an opinion on Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally agree that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are ideologically agreed.
When you look at all these things, about a quarter of the democratic voters say that they do not have an opinion on Sanders.
Although the use of Hillary Clinton's personal e-mail address and server while he is a foreign minister still raises questions, most of the democrats are satisfied with his explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their general opinion on him.
But it is different when you look at America as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now unhappy with his explanation, and only about one third are satisfied.
The public's opinions were divided in March shortly after the matter came to light.
Most Americans say that e-mail polemic did not affect their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent say that their opinion of him has deteriorated.
More than six out of ten Republicans say their opinion of Clinton has become worse.
Although the voters of Clinton's own party consider him honest and reliable, this is still a problem for him for all registered voters, only 32% of whom consider him honest and reliable, and this figure has fallen by 8 percentage points since last month and by 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say they don't think Clinton is honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of the country's registered voters do not consider Trump to be honest and reliable either.
But both Clinton and Trump are considered to be good leaders.
Of the six candidates involved in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered honest, but many do not have an opinion on him, just like Carson does.
The margin of error in the study involving 351 democratists is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in a national survey
Ben Carson comes near Donald Trump at the latest CBS News/New York Times inquiry
In the new survey, two candidates collected half of all votes leaving others to fight for a foothold.
Republican voters across the country are still strongly in favour of Trump, whose support has risen from 23% of the previous CBS questionnaire published on Tuesday, before the election debate in Fox News last month.
At the same time, however, Carson rose dramatically from 6% to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well with different demographic groups and is replacing Trump with higher-education Republican voters.
The rest of the field is lagging behind, except Carly Fiorina and Governor John Kasich of Ohio. The support for Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin has fallen most: from 10% last month to 2% today.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place at 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of this latest poll, which was conducted in September, is +/- 6% for the 376 Republican voters.
Last week's latest CNN/ORC survey showed Carson's rise in the polls: he has 19% support for Republicans and Trump is 32% ahead of him.
According to the latest ABC News/Washington Post survey, Trump was well ahead of Carson.
With Carson's popularity rising last week, Trump criticised the retired neurosurgeon for nothing, even though he apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during his campaign visit to Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood are charged with the death of a first-year student at Baruch College.
Almost two years after the student died at the fraternity impoverishment ceremony in the Pocono Mountains District of Pennsylvania, the murder charge has been brought against five people.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi College of Baruch College, New York City, brutally attacked Chu "Michael" Deng during the membership dispute in September 2013, and then stalled in taking him to the hospital, thus contributing to his death, the police noted.
The authorities say that Deng's eyes were tied and his back was loaded with a pack of sand of more than 13 kg, and then repeatedly hit the ground as he tried to walk through an icy field towards the goal.
Finally, Deng complained that his head hurt, and then he passed out.
The members of the brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng fainted, but according to the allegations they waited an hour before bringing him to the hospital, says the police.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, look online for information about his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the national chairman of the brotherhood, asking him for advice, said Commissioner Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide their ritual equipment and thus practically put the welfare of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng," said Chief Wagner.
Deng could not be revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng sustained blunt force trauma to the head, body, and thighs.
"Too many families have been affected by fraternization, when at least one student has died every year since 1970", said Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, in his statement.
The brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is important.
The Monroe County grand jury advocated that the first five members be charged with murder in the third degree.
32 other members of the brotherhood, including Meng, are also charged with violent execution and criminal intrigue.
"We do not want to be held accountable only for individuals. If there is an organisation that officially or informally approved the situation, they should also be held accountable," Wagner said at the Tuesday press conference.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood and the national brotherhood broke off contact with the local department.
This happens when the US Central Bank raises interest rates
The increase in interest rates will come and the market for rising rates will fall, bond yields will rise and the economy will be in recession.
This is what we know.
What we don't know is how long it takes for all of this to take or how long it takes.
The past does little to help with timing, particularly in terms of the economy.
The result of the recession has taken only 11 months since the first withdrawal, and sometimes it has taken as long as 86 months.
The U.S. Central Bank's aggressiveness in raising interest rates has often, though not always, been a determining factor in the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
That is why the officials of the Federal Reserve have so vigorously stressed that investors should not focus on it because interest rates are being raised, but rather on the development cycle of the period leading to normalisation.
Indeed, there are several variables in the equation.
In the end, however, market participants can see that all the fuss about interest rates has been oversized.
"The Central Bank's first increase since the global economic crisis will inevitably be interpreted in some circles as the end of the era of 'low money'," said Julian Jessop, Chief Economics Specialist at Capital Economics in a message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal, albeit still low, levels to be a revolutionary shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that it has no effect.
Below is an overview of how some sectors of the economy will react in the light of past developments:
As has been seen on the market in the last month or so, waiting for the interest rate to be raised can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
"It seems that the return on capital tends to stop for 12-24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy", Deutsche Bank's analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the central bank's increase.
More specifically, over the last 35 years, the market is generally strong, with an increase of around 14% as we approach the increase, 250 days after that the situation is fairly steady (average increase of 2.6%), and normal conditions have been reached after 500 days with an average return of 14.4% in the last six cycles, reports the recent analysis by Bob Doll, who is leading the capital strategy of Nuveen Asset Management in the Barron's magazine.
According to Deuche Bank, the impact on the shares is usually clearer at the later stage of the increase cycle when the profits start to decrease.
The recessions are part of the economy, but interest rates often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces a number of challenges that have not been encountered in the past and which can speed up the recession.
This is particularly true of GDP, which will be closest to its lowest level ever before the central bank's interest rate increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 withdrawals since 1950 the nominal annual GDP has only twice been below 4.5%.
Although in the second quarter of 2015, the figure was 3.6 per cent, few believe that it will remain when the third quarter has progressed by 1.5 per cent, says the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.
The increase in interest rates in such a fragile economic environment may be risky and raise the question of whether this time is different," said Deutsche Bank.
Market participants have been prepared to increase the central bank throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategists and financial experts believe that the Committee can accept the increase at this meeting, futures trade only foresees a 25% probability.
"Our research shows that since 1950 all the periods of increase have so far occurred in the supercycles of increasing leverage, where GDP has passed its peaks before the recession very quickly after recovery has begun", reports the report.
On the other hand, there has been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst in the observation period.
In the current cycle, the Central Bank has waited by far the longest since the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and now the 74th month is in progress.
The fixed return has also been unstable while the market was waiting for interest rates to be raised, and the model is somewhat similar to the observations made on capital.
The main difference is that when the central bank changes its line, its effects are reflected more quickly in bonds than in shares.
The trend in the yield of debt certificates appears to change immediately at the first increase/surge of the cycle.
At the end of the raise cycle, the debt return will fall immediately," said Deuche Bank.
Charles Schwab strategies believe that the increase in interest rates will result in convergence of yields on longer- and shorter-term bonds, thus smoothing the yield curve.
High-income bonds often produce better in such a situation, although "we are still cautious about finding returns", said Schwab's fixed-income analyst Kathy Jones in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the central bank's policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the fall in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the outlook for a tighter monetary policy", he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, yield curves are more even, credit margins have increased and volatility has increased - all of these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its stance.
In general, companies whose business is mainly located in the United States will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a high level of debt are doing worse when the rise in the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than they have to finance.
"History shows that ‘quality' shares are generally more profitable in the three months following the first interest rate increase", Goldman Sachs' analysts noted in their customer-oriented report.
The companies with strong turnover passed the weak turnover after the increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with high capital return and low volatility shares performed better than lower-quality companies, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
The debt is going to be a big problem.
The companies with a high variable interest rate debt are losing the most," Goldman said.
Outside market speculation, consumers too have the opportunity to benefit from the dollar's increase in value.
Savings can also profit from higher profits, although experts disagree with how quickly the impact will be felt.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM," Andrew Bingham says.
Conservative Member Andrew Bingham blames the channel for "recognizability"
He claims that it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish it from a commercial competitor
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying that they were just imitating the Brit Awards.
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins criticised The Voice for not being original either
BBC Radio 3 is "changing" to Classic FM, claims a leading MP, adding pressure to the production company to prove that it is doing something that commercial production companies do not do.
Conservative Member Andrew Bingham also told BBC leaders that the public service radio channel seemed to "recognise" its content and that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish it from a commercial competitor.
"It seems like Radio 3 - I don't want to use the term "recognizable" - is turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
"The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, only appear to be a Brit Awards gala under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different, here are two examples that I remember directly when you actually just copied something that's already on the market," Bingham said.
The BBC Director-General denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial partner in terms of live music and information sharing with the public.
Radio 3 teaches things about classical music that I can't learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is, in fact, first class.
"I also think it is very important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works," he said.
Earlier this year, the head of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel must do more work than previously to reach the public, because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC's offer, which was criticised for stepping on the toes of commercial competitors during the consultation of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Damien Collins, Member of the Conservative Tory Party, criticised the music competition, which the BBC purchased from the Dutch production company Talpa Media for £22 million, according to estimates.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and is not unique in any way?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 channel program, with Paloma Faith and Boy George as star judges, was produced "in a BBC style".
He added that he wanted the production company to "find success within his own house" the next time it starts the entertainment series.
However, he refused to prevent the production of future The Voice seasons, or to prescribe that the money of the grantors be used for other entertainment formats.
Online sales so far rose least in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Online sales rose by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
Last month there was the lowest increase since the beginning of the statistics in 2000
Three years ago online sales were reinforced by the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts believe that November's Black Friday may help control consumption
Virtual shopping has increased dramatically for over a decade and has turned many of Britain's shopping streets into haunted cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs of a smoothing of online sales in the air, as the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
Total consumption in August increased least since the beginning of statistics in 2000: only five per cent up from last year.
Experts say that there are signs of a smoothing of online sales in the air, as the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
"If you look at the growth levels of previous years and go back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would become more rational over time," Andy Mulcahy, a supplier of the JMRG sales index, told Guardian.
He explained that three years ago online sales became stronger when buyers started using their mobile phones to shop.
It meant that more people were shopping online, and that they could be done in different environments, such as on the couch.
But now it evens out, and (growth) can decrease.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America has been seen as one of the reasons behind the slowing trades.
Experts believe that consumers will curb shopping before the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times as many buyers flocked to their computers to grab shops, knocking down many traders' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, who caused the buyers to argue over the findings, can curb shopping.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one pound out of five were used online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of purchases are now made online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of using fashion chains on shopping streets.
Muslims bury the dead in Mecca's crane accident, consequences for Bin Laden's family
Muslims carried 29 dead bodies across the streets during the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the collapse of the building giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were injured when the crane collapsed.
29 dead were carried through the streets in the air as hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them, and the victims died when the crane collapsed in Mecca's Grand Mosque.
Mostly white-dressed mourners filled the path to honor the first of the dead who made their final journey to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
A sad procession passed a sacred place, where just a few days ago the crane fell through the mosque roof and poured down worshipers.
The bodies were released for burial when the king of Saudi Arabia confirmed that the Bin Laden family was responsible for the disaster, which also injured 394 people.
Of the worshipers killed by cranes in Mecca's Grand Mosque, 29 bodies were carried across the streets
Among the dead were the father of four children from Qasim Akram Bolton, Manchester area, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Akram had been in a large mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
The Saudi authorities have already sworn that Hajj Mecca will continue as thousands continue to enter the city.
Today, King Salman stated that Binladin Group should not have left the crane arm up when it was not in use.
The Arabic version of the decision published by the state-led Saudi Press Agency stated that Binladin Group is partly responsible for the collapse.
The English - speaking service of the news agency did not mention this detail, but it stated that the company's directors were forbidden to travel abroad.
Earlier this week Salman vowed to find out what caused the fall of cranes in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered before the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group has not published any communications on the collapse of the Kurka and its representatives have not been caught for comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the Group of not using up-to-date safeguards and did not cooperate with the meteorological authorities.
There are dozens of cranes around Meka's large mosque, which are part of the huge building raid run by Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades, leading major construction projects.
Al-Qaeda's late leader, Osama bin Laden, was a rebellious son whose family banned him in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in windy and rainy weather only days before millions arrive in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that every capable Muslim should do at least once in his life.
Authorities report that 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities ordered a million rials (£174,000) to be paid to the families of the dead and to the permanently injured.
The others who are injured will receive half of this amount.
B&Q boss says East European low-cost workers are behind the popularity
The British are increasingly using the services of assistants," Veronique Laury says.
The number of professionals coming from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
As a result, 200 more Screwfix stores for professionals will be opened
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores across the country
Author Rupert Steiner, city editor for Daily Mail
The British are said to give up hammers and paintballs and hire skilled Eastern European workers to do home repairs
It seems that if you're clever with a hammer or you're hitting the walls, you're in a minority now.
After all, the British employ more and more helpers to do their own work in their homes," says the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new director-general of Kingfisher, who owns the home improvement chain, said that the popularity lies in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer their services at blasphemous prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Screwfix stores for workers and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said that she wanted more women to work at B&Q stores because eight out of ten purchase decisions made in the store were made by a more beautiful sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: today there are more one woman's households where more home repairs are carried out than before.
Laury said: "The majority of the staff in our stores are still men.
We need to find a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of the purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of only five women who run the most important companies in the British FTSE100 index and has rebuilt her management team with equal numbers of male and female supervisors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which 50% of women are in the group, including its CEO and CFO.
Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is important here.
It has not been difficult to find good women for the management team."
Kingfisher announced an invoice for both six months' profits and sales after the group took on the costs of closing the stores.
As a result of trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening up 200 new stores
The government of the three aces decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
In fact, visible effects were obtained quite quickly.
The sharp head of SAK and other employee centre organisations began to force the country immediately and as a result the country is standing on Friday because of the widespread protest of employees.
There are quite a few who think that reason is also there.
Let's see if it's worth a strike when things are bad.
Even the resistance movement has been set up.
More than 50 000 people have already visited the Internet to announce that they are not going to participate in the demonstration but are going to work.
It would have been impossible for us to do this in an old time of good consensus.
Of course, there was no Internet where to protest, but openly declaring to be a criminal would have been the political suicide of a small person.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of millions of trade unions does not give much thought, but it does give cause for thought.
The status of the trade union movement is no longer as obvious as it was 20 years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement as their own, the values have changed.
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay movement, the harsh decisions of the government can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
When things have seemed to roll on their own weight for years, now we finally get to the point in the unions, namely to defend the rights of the worker, visiblely and properly.
In this way, the government may wish to incarcerate the role of the Ay movement, when membership of the trade union may be seen as more necessary than before.
No matter what the organisations think, it is nonsense that Friday's demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped long ago.
For example, industrial output has fallen for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product will continue to decline and unemployment will rise.
You'd think these things would force everyone's mind.
For the University of Lappeenranta, a hard saving course: The goal is to save 8.5 million, reduce staff by 130
Lappeenranta University of Technology will start a saving course with a total cost reduction of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start negotiations for all staff with a savings target of 6.5 million annually.
In practice, this means reducing around 130 workers.
In addition, two million will be saved from other activities.
The background to the negotiations is the 2016 budget, which foresees a deficit of 8.5 million in actual activity.
It is also affected by the budget cuts made by the government.
During this financial year, the university will make about 2.6 million in deficit results.
The costs will increase slightly next year, but at the same time the funding from the Ministry will decrease by EUR 2 million and the rest by EUR 3.2 million.
The university's total budget is approximately EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive cuts in education and research and the reduction in corporate funding for our university is very significant," says Principal Anneli Pauli in the University's Bulletin.
Before the summer, the impact of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in additional funding is reflected in new dimensions.
Negotiations with shop stewards will be launched on Tuesday of next week and will last the six weeks laid down by law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finland for railways
The owner of the cheap bus company Onnibus, the British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company also aims at rail traffic in Finland.
I am very interested in taking part in Finnish rail traffic.
My Stagecoach company is one of Britain's largest railway companies," Souter says.
Rail transport should gradually open up to competition.
The first is local transport in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in 2017-2018.
After commuter traffic, long-distance traffic is on the move.
Souter says he's already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes the Onnibus plans.
Other international companies have expressed interest in rail transport at least by Transdev (formerly Veolia), which also has bus traffic in Finland and rail traffic in other parts of Europe.
The Federal Reserve has to make decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world will stand by when the U.S. Central Bank meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision as to whether to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
When Reuters asked 80 economists a little over half of those who believed last week that the Central Bank would raise interest rates, now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and that interest rates are kept at the current 0-0.25% level.
This is an historic event, because it is seven years since the central bank cut its interest rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank has the opportunity to get out of zero and start normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Peterson Institute for International Economics Senior Fellow.
The US economy has functioned relatively well and the recovery has brought billions of dollars to the balance sheets and created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore less rosy global prospects.
It has warned the market that they should be ready for withdrawal, but the signs also show that they believe that the probabilities are against the increase.
The decision will be published on Thursday at 20:00 (CET).
The shooter at Delta State University left an apology note.
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning... before shooting her colleague later that day... Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he was "bad" about the first murder and hoped "that he could cancel it," the authorities told him on Tuesday.
The Gautier police in Mississippi reported that Delta State University Geography and Social Sciences teacher Lamb called 911 at about ten o'clock in the morning.
Monday and told me he shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police had to send officers to his home.
He said "killed his wife last night" and also mentioned that there was a "sweet dog" in the house that "does not disturb anyone" but is probably shocked.
The police asked the caller's name, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb didn't give us an explanation for the shooting.
When the police got there, there was found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a note written by 45-year-old Lamb that said, "I'm so sorry I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me."
After writing a message, Lamb drove nearly 500 miles [500 km] to Delta State, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt before finally killing himself late Monday when he was surrounded by the police.
The university principal William LaForge said that, as far as he knew, there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that " clearly there was something in Lamb's mind".
The authorities said on Tuesday that despite the claims published on Monday that Lamb believed Prentiss to have been related to Schmidt, there was no "information or evidence" of any kind of "triangular drama".
Shawn O'Steen said he was married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as a "good person."
A couple broke up 15 years ago, but they stayed friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who is "disturbed."
O'Steen told me that Prentiss and his daughter were "ever and ever best friends".
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked from home online. According to Sun Herald, Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
The police said that Lamb called his relatives somewhere on Monday to tell them that "he's not going to jail."
When the police reached Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car on the side of the road, left it there, and ran into the woods where he shot himself.
Lamb debated educational science at Delta State in spring 2015, says the CV found on the University's website.
The stars that lost their charms
The actor (left), with his son Redmond (right), has had a hard time in recent years.
In 2001 he suffered from leukemia and in 2009 his long-standing partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
Rumor has it he has also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this really takes its toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw is out for months because of a double fracture.
Luke Shaw had a double fracture to his right leg as Manchester United destroyed PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League match.
Even though the defenseman stayed in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will still be able to play this season.
The injury was caused by Héctor Moreno's reckless tackle at 15 minutes after 20-year-old Shaw crashed into the PSV area.
He was treated for nine minutes in the field and had to be given oxygen before taking him to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture on his leg and he's in the hospital now."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after, and then he'll have surgery in Manchester.
The boy comes to Manchester United when he's 18 years old, gets into trouble and then plays great, and this is what's gonna happen.
When I was in the locker room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but it's gonna take at least six months for a double fracture, and he's not playing in the block phase.
I hope he gets to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky to get a red card and a punishment shot.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian trustee erred.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say it became a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a very bad two-foot tackle.
Shaw tweeted: "Thank you all for your messages, words are not enough to tell you how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I'll come back stronger."
Related: Manchester United suffers from the Luke Shaw case and loses to PSV
The English defender has an additional incentive to recover from next June's European Championships in France.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's a very bad injury."
If a player gets out because of this kind of injury, everyone's very sad.
Our players are never meant to offend an opponent.
Moreno's leg was broken when he played on the Mexican team against Van Gaal's Dutch at the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno takes this hard because it's not meant to hurt your opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, it's bad," Cocu said.
I didn't see it in that situation.
The only thing I saw was the ball that was going in a different direction, so it seemed as if he [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn't see Luke's tackle.
Moreno said to SBS6: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel terrible about this. I'm so sorry."
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after Chris Smalling challenged him.
David Cameron must know Lorax better than this.
Each parent will soon learn one thing: If your child loves a book, it won't take long to learn it almost by heart.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When the vacation childcare service asked the Prime Minister for his favorite children's book, he chose Dr. Seuss's book The Lorax, an environmental protection story published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes in a message published on the SuperCamps website and continues: "A fun, moving, creative and contains a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children because it always seems to have a picture or a message we've never seen before."
All of this is true, but the next paragraph in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book is a summary of the 2012 film version, in which a rather short original text had been filled with new characters and details.
"In the city of Need, where all nature has disappeared and even the air is a commodity, Ted boy hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams by fulfilling Audrey's wish to see the right tree," says and describes the love story that Dr Seuss, who died in 1991, did not write.
If this is not yet suspicious enough, Cameron's text sounds like it was taken from the plot summary of the Lorax movie found on the Internet Movie Database website, beginning with: "In the city inside the majors, in which everything is artificial and even the air is merchandise, Ted boy hopes to win over the heart of his dream girl Audrey."
In view of Cameron's public activity as a parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so unacquainted with the plot of the book. Here the young, anonymous boy hears how the local nature has been destroyed by the greedy, tree-crushing and need-sweeping Kerskanen, regardless of the short, mustache-like creature Lorax who has given the story the name, who "speaks for the trees".
Such a relatively invisible PR assignment has probably been outsourced to an assistant who apparently has never read the book 20 times in a row for a child.
The Prime Minister's spokesman said that the text must have come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff but did not comment further at that time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being sidelined from the English team, but it was still a tough spot.
Playing against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for the tour, I don't think the last 3-0 series loss is likely to happen again.
I wouldn't rule out a foreign win.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than a team three years ago, but it involves good curvers and the team's thinking is strong: they don't have scars from 2012, just youthful positiveness.
Moen Ali develops in his spiral feeds, and Adil Rashid is an attacker, even though he is an unknown factor at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped out of England's cricket team, replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth on the team is understandably difficult to analyse for me because I'm his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against attackers under challenging conditions, and the simple but harsh truth is that cricket players are judged by their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root's choice until the announcement because, as I have said before, players are the best choice makers.
About a hundred points more, and Lyth's season on the team could have continued, but he was himself responsible for his own fate.
I hope if he gets more runs for Yorkshire, there'll be a second chance.
England's head coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth's attitude even when he didn't do as well as he could, and that doesn't surprise me. Lyth is, above all, a team player.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long a hitter gets to leave a mark.
Lyth was chosen seven times for the national team, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton got the chance to play both at home and at guests.
The only complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott first for the Caribbean when Lyth was in top shape, but that missed opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming with us, and there's a hitter I appreciate.
As a cricket player, he has something we saw in Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 points against us on Trent Bridge field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as the others before him, but of course this depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen in an opening next to Cook has been splattered, allowing an extra pitcher to enter the field but keeping four fast, and I am not against this.
I don't understand why a hitter couldn't hit him there, and this left-handed guy has already shown himself to be quite a cricket player.
Moen may not have done his job in his county in Worcestershire, but he is their third and there is little difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games when the first grid fell before the opening in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points and did not remember the past.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup pitcher, and, just as I've been dealing with him, he seems like a very impressive young man.
People can look at his unpretentious statistics, hitting the average of 31, with the ball of 35, and think it's gambling, but there are not too many pitchers and voters chose young people.
He's learning a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few tough additions to the coach's side.
The appointment of the Sri Lankan striker Mahela Jayawardene as a consultant to the games may prove to be a genius.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game, and brings with him a huge amount of experience because he's done everything in all situations and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to the games of the white ball and brings both energy and a ruthless glimpse.
I have always thought that he was born to be a part of international cricket, whether it's playing or training, and he has the same kind of brain that Mahela has.
Sometimes new sounds in the locker room can refresh the team even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is being rested at one-days, Root was given the same break against Australia, and at least I have no problem with this.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and chosen do not make schedules.
And you have to remember that just like players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions are never made lightly.
Britain's departure from the EU (Brexit) can win if the economy is in difficulty in 2017
David Cameron's half-baked renegotiating strategies to keep Britain in the EU are becoming increasingly problematic every day, even if we do not take into account even the cordial Jeremy "Is it a yes or a no?" Corbyn's election to the leadership of the Labour Party or the anger of the Trade Union Confederation on Tuesday.
The foreigners also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farage.
A European diplomatic friend recently explained that, because the EU is so deeply involved in various crises, not all of which are its own fault, some Member States are tired of the self-centered British agenda, which is full of discordant concessions and disturbing treaty changes that these countries do not want for the most part.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Confederation of Trade Unions decided not to want them either if they undermine social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, taking a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, either with or without the local eye, and then coming home and saying that they will win supporters for reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outwards inside the British EU tent - 'Don't leave us alone with France', says Berlin - suggests that the short-sighted ministers and officials of certain capitals are now at a point where they don't care if we leave.
Germany's cautious and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her office before it gets ruined in the same way as she did for those who stayed too long (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French François Hollande faces a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's a fleeting force, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain has a left-wing government.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrifice themselves for selfiebritts, when their energy should rather be directed at preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want it either because of similar separatist tendencies.
So, my friend puts forward, some of these ministers may even consciously plan to make useless remarks in the Scottish National Party style during the 2017 British referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
"The renegotiating was an arranged case and "The renegotiating was of no importance to Britain."
Europeans have had a bitter experience of how gluttonous Fleet Street newspapers can be and how EU-sceptics are, what they were not during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, when our membership began in 1973 was confirmed by the ratio of 2:1.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the largest Euro opportunist who named himself by writing about 'EU straight bananas' when he was a correspondent in Brussels in the early 90s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a wide range of tax-exempting rascals, cell phones hacking foreigners, and persons who have their nominal headquarters elsewhere and who own most of our major newspapers.
Tony Blair actually felt the same way about them, but he realized that if you're in a cage with a horny gorilla, you have to give up bananas because of the distraction, unless you want to be on the lunch menu of that gorilla and later on for dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more blair-like than Blair himself, in relation to the opposition to Cameron's renegotiating act, because Bair had agreed to the principle behind the rejected EU Constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But a nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly patted me on the back at the Westminster Parliamentary House on Monday (I told him he no longer had time to waste on me), seems to be in danger of re-emerging Neil Kinnock's '80s boycott of Murdoch, which was a mistake both then and now.
Although it may take time, he is forced to develop a consistent strategy to keep in touch with the media. Not with me, but undoubtedly with Andrew Marri, whose BBC couch Corby left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, to put it nicely, evolving.
He says that he would like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most of the people outside of the British Independence Party Ukip's military enthusiasm and the most fierce nationalists in the Conservative Party can certainly take up this view.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn-fan" Benn said this, both on the radio and on TV this week, when his inner scout would have liked to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint rugged John McDonnell as the finance minister of the shadow government was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his father-in-law struggled on TV trying to be disloyal to his colleagues in the Labour Party without going so far as to lose his seat in government.
Hilary's struggles were more attractive.
But the fight to keep up with "any situation" - Benn's comment - was not what McDonnell said, nor, from everything that Corbyn told the chiefs and MPs at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the unhierarchical, emotional, and personal image Corbyn wants to convey (remember that he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important in the era of 24-hour TV, and especially in the cycles of social media, which is an acceptable breeding ground for paranoia and fraud.
As Mr McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to take the Labour Party's support in the referendum campaign for granted.
At least Simon Jenkins thinks so.
However, the basic rotation between McDonnell and Corbyn on EU membership (and in line with their Benn-spirited regulated economy and anti-Capital past) is no longer just a difficult debate with left-wingists who have the narcissism of small differences as a central dogma in doctrinal squabbles.
As far as his duality with NATO is concerned (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby is not campaigning to give up), foreign diplomats simply have to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they also have suspicious voters) on concessions to Britain when it can be in vain?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed by the weak military performance of the British people in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with the cost-cutting conservative government in power, as I was reminded by the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticized Public Health England's e-cigarette assessment
Researchers have said that the state-funded agency's claim that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than traditional ones originated from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom had links with the tobacco industry.
Experts who wrote to the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on electronic tobacco.
PHE published this report last month, describing it as "a comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of data and referred to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, the medical journal Lancet published an editorial that attacked the main conclusion of the PHE's "exceptional Hutera base".
The other two researchers who wrote at BMJ have wondered whether the claims were "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: "The main principle of public health is that policies must be based on proven effectiveness."
They say that the public expects that the PHE's claim "that electronic cigarettes are approximately 95% less harmful than traditional tobacco" is based on detailed assessment and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from one meeting of 12 people, which developed a multi-criteria analysis model (MCDA) to synthesise their opinions on the disadvantages associated with various nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarised in the study.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was EuroSwiss Health, whose director-general is reported to have previously received funding for independent research from Bristish American Tobacco.
He also supported BAT's public health powers in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting reported receiving funding from an electric cigarette manufacturer, but not the money he was reported to have received from Philip Morris International, a tobacco company, they add.
The selection criteria for panel members are not stated, but the panel includes a number of well-known supporters of electronic tobacco, some of which also report that they have received funding from the sector in the study.
Others present are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco director of the PHE.
The research produced by the group "many admits" that there is a lack of "incontrovertible evidence regarding the disadvantages of most products and most of the criteria", McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these links or restrictions are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say that PHE's claims that "there is no evidence for the time being that electronic tobacco acts as a route to smoking in children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at the PHE, says that the claims made at the BMJ have been answered earlier.
He says, "Electric cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking."
Half of those who smoke their lifetimes die of addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there is so much public uncertainty about the relative risks compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80 000 people die each year from smoking-related illness and smoking costs £2 billion a year to NHS.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, even though e-cigarettes are not risk-free, their disadvantages are only a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco - we fulfil our national responsibilities.
BBC should give up East Enders, says former Channel 4 Director
Former Channel 4 President Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "give anything" of such hits as this soap opera set on Albert Square, for example.
Johnson said that licence fees should only be used to make programs that other British broadcasters do not do.
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes, which are likely to have a smaller audience, on difficult transmission times against the most viewed programmes of competitors and on such channels as BBC4.
After the BBC Director General Tony Hall said that the company wanted to cooperate more with other organisations, Johnson said that he tried to establish a relationship with the BBC for six years, for nothing.
"I do not understand the idea that the BBC produces and broadcasts programmes that would be clearly suitable for unsubvented competitors," Johnson said to the Upper House Communications Committee as part of its research into the future of the BBC.
If the licence fee is adhered to - and I am not sure that it would be a good idea for this media or in the long term - it should at least limit its production to programmes that others do not do and produce.
The Voice is being sent to the most important broadcast time because it wants as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else shows the show is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's obviously nonsense.
Johnson said: "I do not understand why a regressive tax should finance programmes which could also be financed without state aid.
The Voice is one such and the EastEnders another, admittedly within the house executed.
Frankly, other channels would give anything to do with it.
I don't understand how it's about a public service broadcast.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC at all."
The serial entrepreneur Johnson, who led Channel 4 between 2004 and 2010, said that the BBC is guilty of the hunting of audiences "because of the goals of people working there, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular series resemble those of former Sky Director Tony Ball, who used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that BBC sell such series as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's smaller audience's public service programmes "will go to BBC4, where the number of viewers cannot often be measured, but the BBC will thus assume its responsibilities and then, in defending the income of £4 billion in licence fees, can hypocritically say that 'of course, we are doing all these unknown programs that no one is watching'.
They put them on a mission site where no one ever comes to see them.
With regard to the licence fee, Johnson said to the committee: "I challenge you to find a more regressive system of who gets the most from it.
Of course you all think, we all think that £150 a year gets a lot of value, but I don't know if that's true for those people for whom £150 is big money because they don't use much BBC.
David Elstein, former director of Sky and Channel 5, who also witnessed to the Committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should re-evaluate its mission in Reith's day "to inform, train and entertain".
He said that only a small proportion of BBC production is currently classified as education - he said the figures are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should take the model from Australian and Canadian broadcasting and transform the task into "information, education and entertainment".
As far as partnership issues are concerned, Elstein said that the BBC should focus more on events such as Proms concerts, which he says are only showing a few on TV, and join with commercial companies to make them all accessible online.
"Audiogenetics" allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how shuttle worms change direction as soon as the sound impulse hits them.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems to control them by sound wave bursts.
The tiny shuttle worms change direction as soon as they are hit by a sound impulse that is too high to be heard by the human ear.
The impulses work by switching on genetically modified motion nerve cells with membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Related: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
Researchers said that worms indicate the functioning of a new method called sound genetics, where ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that one day the method may replace deep brain stimulation, a invasive procedure whereby electrical impulses are introduced into the human brain to treat Parkinson's disease.
The shuttles normally do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when they were surrounded by fluid with microscopic bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles strengthened ultrasound waves, which then passed through the worms.
Confirmed ultrasound waves affect TRP-4-ion channels, structures found in the membranes of some worms.
Sound waves cause these ion channels to open up and activate the cells attached to them, reports a report published in Nature Communications.
In order to produce nematode-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified worms to include TRP-4 ion channels in some of their motion nerve cells.
When Chalasani used ultrasound on modified carpets, microbubbles strengthened sound waves and transmitted them to worms where they switched on modified motion nerve cells.
The method has some features similar to those of optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to switch on and off nerve cells by using light impulses.
However, Chalasani says that the use of sonogenetics may have some advantages over optogenetics.
Unlike the light that must be transmitted along the optical fiber to the desired site within the brain, low - frequency ultrasound waves can pass through the tissue unhindered, so they can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus may make it possible to cause the target human nerve cells to react temporarily to the ultrasound signal in certain neurological treatments in the clinical environment," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment delivered to your home!
Advertising puts Britain's arms trade in shame.
Check out Amnesty International's anti-weapon show video.
Horrible killer planes!
Leghold traps crushing ankles!
Grape bombs!
And electric stun kits that cause painful pain but leave no trace!
The joyful voice and the visual language of the comics leaves no doubt that this advertisement for the world's largest gun fair is a sharp parody produced by Amnesty International in order to highlight the British Government's willingness to sell arms to repressive regimes at the Defence and Security Equipment International's ExCeL Centre in the London Shipyard Area.

With a separate campaign, many posters also appeared at bus stops and metro trains requiring a closer look.
"Important information, Do you travel on the DLR route from 15 to 18 September?" together are asked using the London Underground font and brand, as the DLR track becomes a image of the tank.
In this September, a bunch of gun dealers are arriving on the DLR route... customers are being asked to help stop the gun fair.
These 300 posters are made by artists whose works were displayed at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksyn Dismaland (the Museum of Cruel Designs).
A collective called Special Pathol Group helped spread posters around London using the "Ad Space Hack Packs" packages, a six-pound package of hexagon keys that, according to the collective, "can access one third of the advertising space of bus stops on the entire planet".
Transport for London is not amused by this illicit "proclaimed vandalism".
One of the parody ads produced by the Special Pathrol Group.
According to Cruel Designs curator and University of Essex lecturer Gavin Grindon, artists are increasingly questioning and wanting to take political work to outside the galleries.
Many artists have started working with activists in resistance breasts when they realized that they must go to the outside world if they want their art to affect society.
Another anti-arms poster greets commuters on the subway.
Amnesty's video has been viewed over 100,000 times over the last 24 hours via Facebook. It was created free by VCCP, and also by a graphic designer and background reviewer worked for free.
VCCP's creative director Matt Lever found that the gun fair was not advertised at all, and there was an empty spot on ExCeL's calendar at the time, and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the idea of a more realistic advertisement for obscure corporate governance, but "it was more stopping to stress the matter with bright colors and animation".
"They have done fantastic work to help us raise questions about illegal torture equipment sold at fairs," says Amnesty's Tom Davies.
Now the British Government must take action to ensure that torture equipment is not illegally sold near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art in connection with the gun fair comes from inside ExCeL when exhibitors sell fantastically embellished products.
In his press release, Saab revealed that he had received an order from the US Army for "AT4CS RS on the shoulder".
This includes "a unique pipe launcher with excellent effects on the back of the armor inside the target".
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a dormitory
It's been 11 years since I was an ignorant 19-year-old and moved to a dormitory, where I still believed in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the forced smiles of the people I irritated - and numerous, long complaints about others.
Much of what I have learned can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving to a dormitory can be anything from a nerve to a totally scary one.
It's tempting to babble: tell me where you're from, whether you liked the year off, and where you think about Corbyn, and why "I don't really love or hate Marmite because it's really just yeast extract HAHAHA I'll find me in my room."
Take a breath.
And help others to take a breath - ask questions and show interest.
It will guide the conversation and help you find the people you like, not those you don't want to talk to even if your eyelashes are on fire and they would share fire extinguishers.
Give people some space.
People's rooms often turn into cocktail parties, movie evenings and public entertainment places, but they are also the places where people dress and repair their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about starting college when you're in a relationship
College's a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but many dormitories form a culture of walking from room to room that is friendly, social and creates lifelong friendships.
It could mean hell for someone who's trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you permission to say, "I like you and I want to be friends with you, but you have to leave now so that I can recover the energy I spent talking to you."
Try to sense when a college friend is tired of socializing and maybe send a text message to the door instead of knocking.
Knocking when I got the speech: knock.
A guy at my dorm said if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw some pretty good things.
Make friends through baking.
Since you're starting college at the top of the baking trend, knocking on people's doors with a chocolate cake plate and presenting yourself seems a little less strange, less "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something for you," now smile when I ask you personal questions from the '50s.
Offering self-made delicacies is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to talk, and it may be that in the future they will associate your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you know how to bake.
Badly mixed flour-sugar-fat lumps are likely to make people pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dormitories.
Understandably, taking a chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk for your tea?
Ask and check with the milk owner.
It's possible they'll give you permission, even if they boil internally.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you get my sympathy, but try to treat it more like an adult than my roommate who mixed her milk with detergent to punish those who stole it.
He's in prison now.
You should not make such noise that people cannot sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent human being, but because you're like that proverbial casserole beating the pot.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor if they could play their drum and bass music quieter because it was 3:00 in the morning and she had an exam this morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally shut up at five in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep for two hours before making her own music roar, locked her doors and took a three - hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dorm with you?
Or inversely, wouldn't it be incredibly awkward if you considered a roommate as your future mate, got together, divorced, and then you saw him every day and possibly lost all your friends to him.
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, but if the hot roommate really isn't your future spouse, you could at least try to reason with your downside.
In the exhilarating moment when you discover that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between pranks and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good prank is fun, but you can be canceled in a second.
You can teach us a useful and fun lesson about safety by hiding something... but never mess up someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys in a glass of water, which you'll put in the freezer, but don't put their property on the ceiling with a blue sticker more than twice at most.
A racist attack on the accommodation of foreign students in Kitee - The house planned as a reception centre was vandalized in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack was carried out on the accommodations of foreign students in Kite in North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, it is not the accommodations for minors who have been in Finland for longer than that, says Heidi Luukkainen, teacher at the Kite Evankelinen folk high school.
The windows and walls of the dormitory's accommodations were stained with racist signs, such as swastikas, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one of the accommodations," says the police of Eastern Finland.
According to Luukkainen, who is responsible for youth guarantee training at the Folk High School, there were an estimated ten people in the vandalized building at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and grown-up people are free to move, so some might have been elsewhere," Luukkainen says.
People from 12 different nationalities are staying at the folk high school.
They have already been students in Finland for some time, as well as newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
Everyone in a messed-up building has a status.
Some study in adult comprehensive school, some in vocational studies and some in Finnish," says Luukkainen.
A status is a so-called continuous residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreign national who has been in Finland for some time.
The police in Eastern Finland investigate the attack as an act of damage and a violation of domestic peace.
According to Luukkainen, an information conference was held for students on Monday, with the necessary interpreters present.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for over a decade, and this is the first time something like this has happened," Luukkainen says.
According to Lukkainen, the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
At least three men were suspected of doing so and they had been travelling on a light car.
I think this is the whim of the youth weekend evening, when this subject has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious," Luukkainen says.
In Salo, too, a hospital has been vandalized and a reception centre has been planned.
The incident happened last week.
This matter was reported on MTV's website on Tuesday night.
There was a swastika drawn on the hospital wall and written in English "You are not welcome".
A police report has been filed.
Clarification 15.9. at 4.02 p.m. Corrected incorrect information provided by the police regarding the age and status of the people living in the building.
The government is shutting down the Y train to Karjai - the passengers are grumpy, "unintelligently idiotic"
The Y train from Helsinki to Raasepori Karja will stop running in March.
The news was indignant at passengers arriving at the beginning of the train at the Helsinki Central Railway Station.
In particular, the downfall strikes the Siuntians," said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It's totally idiotic because the population is growing and the working people need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be anything but political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says on HSTV's interview video he'll come to the capital with a tractor or something.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H- and R-trains running on the main track will be combined into a new R-line.
Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula will be disabled.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on the routes on which the Ministry buys train traffic during the next contract period.
The contract period will change at the end of the year and there will be routes to be closed throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement to be finalised in the autumn will be subsequently adopted by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Bengtström from Siuntio considers that the state's train cutter is short-sighted.
We are making the same mistakes that have been made in the past and are repeating them in a very systematic way.
And then there's regret.
The Y train is also used by others other than the Raseporians and the Siuntios, because it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Annina Pöyry, from Espoo, was upset by the fate of those travelling farther away from the city area by train.
"It's especially bad for those who have to redeploy their journey," he said when he was in pain on the Y train.
A little relief is about to come.
There will probably be a new train connection to the beach, which will replace the Y train in the Helsinki Region (HSL), i.e. take it all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This will increase the costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for the municipalities and their taxpayers in the region.
"We are now beginning to explore different options and their impact on service level and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to estimate the costs accurately.
According to Rihtniemi, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid around one million for the Y train a year, but the Ministry has certainly paid much more than that.
The R-line on the main track misses two stations.
Instead, the number of train shifts in Ainola and Saunakallio will double.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease throughout the country.
The Ministry no longer buys train traffic on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is shortened to Pieksämäki-varkaus.
Train services are reduced on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka harbour and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million trips per year are made on stopping shifts, while the total number of trips purchased by the Ministry is about nine million.
The new agreement is intended to provide the State with an annual savings of 12.3 million.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in Capital's Currentness book: "Marx is worth studying"
The global economic crises have brought to the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and the capital of his terminal published in 1867-1894, writes George Hakanen, a former Chairman of the SKP, in his book Marx's Capital's topicality today.
"He is now taken more seriously than in a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx's assessments of the development of the capitalist economy, internationalisation and penetration into all areas of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of financial and fictional capital have proved to be astonishingly farsighted.
The list of authors of the book based on the capital seminars organised by Hakase also includes the professor of Aalto University, the respected financial figure Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes that Marx is current "now and forever".
However, the former Chief Executive Officer of the Business Research Institute and the Business Delegation is not Marxist, is it?
No, no, no, no.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not regard Marx as a current economic thinker but rather as an interesting social theorist.
Today, social sciences are differentiated and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary expert.
"The usual idea is that the history of the idea tells of the wrong opinions of dead men," Korkman starts.
It is true that Marx's predictions went terribly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far conclusions from the beginning of capitalism," Korkman says.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"The more relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now we are again discussing Marx's interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may be able to give inspiration to anyone who wants to understand the big picture, the changing world as a result of the technological upheaval," Korkman analyses.
But what the government should decide tomorrow isn't gonna help.
After all, he thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should only be stopped.
Still, Korkman thinks it's a good idea to get to know Marx.
"In the '70s Marx could not be read," Korkman says.
"Maoists and Trotskyists and other sects all hated capitalism, but even more hate each other."
Today, the debate is more diverse and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political burdens of the past.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's mindset as well as other classics," Korkman says.
The UN calls for war criminals to be convicted in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the creation of a special court to investigate war crimes committed during the Sri Lankan Civil War, reports AFP.
The UN report on the civil war in 1983-2009 was published on Wednesday after a long postponement.
The report blames both the Sri Lankan armed forces and rebels known as Tamil Tigers for war crimes.
It is estimated that at least 100,000 people died in the Sri Lankan Civil War.
Even the number of victims is not exactly known.
Especially in the last months of the long war in 2009, a major military attack should be properly investigated, as called for in the UN report.
The Sri Lankan Armed Forces report blames torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which is as likely to be the victim of men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have been guilty of forcing bystanders and children into combatants.
According to the report, both parties have committed murders.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intended to organise the investigation itself, but did not intend to allow the UN Court of Justice to be set up because foreign judges.
In England's Yo test, you had a chance to weigh social media.
On Wednesday, the autumn student writings included a long foreign language, which the majority had English.
England's skills were tested by over 16,000 trainees.
You could write a paper on social media or something.
Based on our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the writing of the 150-250 word could be addressed to the editor of the online magazine's advice column.
The headline was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt corresponds to Leelia's Finnish resting chair.
He was asked for advice on how to get parents to look at matters for young people as well.
The total number of subjects was four, one of which had to be selected.
"It was the hardest of them", assessed the third topic by Mia Lybeck, English lecturer at the Swedish High School in Porvoo.
The third subject was just a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
On the other hand, Lybeck said the fourth topic was quite nice.
It had to write a fire speech as to why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school we have practiced writing speeches," Lybeck says and estimates the whole experiment "unlikely normal".
In English - or Swedish - the English experiment allowed you to answer questions about texts such as adaptation to climate change and handling of large data masses.
On Wednesday some long Russian (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
The autumn articles will continue on Friday, when another Finnish or Swedish or Finnish experiment will take place.
In upper secondary schools, the test is organised normally, which means that it is not affected by employees' protests.
The matriculation examination board advises the candidates to find suitable transport connections in time to get to the trial.
You can also have more time if you can prove that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
A shop was robbed in Oulu at gunpoint.
On Wednesday morning, a shop was robbed in the Kello district in Oulu.
According to the police, the robber was wearing dark clothes and a face - covering commando hat.
The man's normal body and about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money as his prey.
It's being investigated as a felony robbery.
The police are preparing tens of thousands of protestors for their arrival in Helsinki - support teams from other parts of Finland
A protesting demonstration against the government's operating decisions will be blocking the city centre on Friday, predicting the police.
According to preliminary information, as many as tens of thousands of people can arrive.
Members of the Associations of SAK, Akava and STK will meet at the Railway Market at 11 a.m.
Police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
In turn, the task of the police at work is not only to carry out alert tasks and other police activities, but also to ensure that the expression of a giant mind goes smoothly.
Roads leading to the railway market will be closed to motor vehicles for the period from approximately 9.30 to 14 p.m.
Only emergency vehicles will be allowed in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut off at Kaisaniemi's roundabout, from the west to Mannerheimintie.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Chief Inspector Seppo Kujala?
At least for the time being, it looks like it's enough.
I'm not taking a stand on a cop's industrial disputes.
According to Kujala, support teams from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki because of the demonstration.
The police won't tell us the exact number of patrols.
"Some amount is coming, but as a rule we can manage on our own," Kujala says.
Police advise against private car driving in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic bump extends from Hakaniemi level to its core center.
Standing traffic is expected from the morning early in the evening.
With protestors from other parts of Finland, a lot of charter buses are also coming to Helsinki.
They won't let them go to Railway Market.
Buses, in principle, remain quite distant.
The rest of the way must then be walked to the demonstration site," Kujala says.
The demonstration also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From the point of view of the police, there's a positive side to this.
The issue of the smooth running of public transport, which is normally at hand at these large gatherings of people, will now be dealt with on its own.
The demonstrators have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of government economic policy may come to Helsinki.
The police expect the demonstration to proceed peacefully.
After all, people are ordinary people who work or are unemployed - ordinary citizens.
After all, Finns are sensible and peaceful people," says Kujala.
Local demonstrations will also be held in different parts of Finland on Friday.
Friday's demonstration is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is not a very good benchmark for it in Finnish political history," says Emeritus Martti Sisiäinen, professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It's no wonder the Ay movement is protesting.
If it didn't, it would put your hands up in front of the government," Siisäinen says.
A very right-wing government has struck at the cores of Finnish corporatism tradition - and also at points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's tough grip on contract law is missing.
There are a lot of features here that we are really trying to get the Ay movement down on its knees.
At the same time, too, the Ay movement has a place to look in the mirror.
A mirror is needed, for example, because the Ay movement does not have the support of all employees for Friday's demonstrations.
What is new now is the sharp division that the demonstration will bring about in the group that the Ay movement would like to take part in the demonstration.
The unemployed people gathered from all over Finland expressed themselves at the Parliamentary House in November 1993.
If you're looking for a point of reference for Friday's demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed," says Siisiäinen, organized in 1993.
In the middle of the deepest recession, Murrostorsta gathered together 20,000 unemployed.
The government of Esko Ahon (Kesk) stumbled from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relationship between the Finnish Government and employees' organisations had never been as bad as in the days of Aho's bourgeois government.
Now the relationship between the government and the Ay movement may be even worse than in the time of Murrostorsta.
Furthermore, Finland's highest bourgeois government is now in power," Siisiäinen says.
The current coalition of government is still interesting in such a way that it is so strict in the right, despite what the Finns said.
There were still certain elements of the old labour movement at the time of the storm.
Several thousand protesters are expected on Friday.
The demonstration also stops public transport and possibly closes day care centres and schools.
Although the demonstration does not receive undivided support from employees, it can become the largest in many years.
In recent years, approximately 300 demonstrations have been held in Helsinki every year.
They're from side to side.
Traditionally, Finnish protests by the Ay movement have been quite peaceful - even though the policies have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, we are law-abiding.
The protestors are trying to avoid damaging or destroying property," Siisäinen says.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of demonstration changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and the police prepared to get some pig shit on their heads.
The firefighters strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also striking strikes, including pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical strikes in the 1970s
The most significant strikes in the 1970s were a metal strike in 1971 and a power plant and electric strike in 1977.
Seventy thousand metal men took part in the metal men's strike.
The strike was suspended by a proposal from the Conciliation Board after seven weeks of the strike.
Metalmen received a 16 percent increase in wages.
In the spring of 1977, the electric strike lasted 49 days and caused blackouts all over the country.
Breakthrough Thursday, 1993
On 4 November 1993 some 20 000 people, many of whom have been made unemployed by the recession, met in front of the Parliamentary House to demonstrate their work.
Firefighters striked for three months in 1998
Firefighters' strike was one of the longest, if not the longest, national strike in the 1990s.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were caught in an egg rain when farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
'Siberia teaches, the EU stops' was one of the slogans.
To Espa, farmers fell tons of snow.
The Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 also led farmers to protest and burn bales in front of the meeting place.
Nurses strike in 1983 and 1995
Nurses were on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been on strike was 1983.
The strike in 1995 was colored by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened with strike and mass withdrawals of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass redundancies hastened the negotiations to a conclusion.
Doctors on strike 2001
"Doctors on strike - under duress" was the slogan of striking doctors in 2001.
The strike by municipal health centre and hospital doctors lasted about five months and sparked a lively debate on how strikes could endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector increased doctors' salaries.
Students on the move in 2013
Around 5,000 students marched in favour of student support from Senate Square to Parliament House in Helsinki in 2013.
The Central Crime Police investigates the background of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the Central Crime Police for assistance in investigating the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, in Aisterheim, near the German border, the Austrian police stopped a truck with 42 refugees.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
Those on the ice truck were all in good shape.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and the main responsibility lies at the scene in Austria, says Tero Haapala, Chief Inspector of the Central Crime Police.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling by lorry in Austria were more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board apparently died by suffocation.
According to the Finnish public limited company, the truck belongs to a Finnish company, which first reported its cooperation with the Austrian police.
Among other things, the company carries out restaurant activities and its CEO is a man of foreign background, about 40 years old.
In Austria, two Iraqi men have been arrested for smuggling human beings.
A refugee-beating captain, a former drug courier and a rich businessman - the story of five smugglers
A loaded king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a stylistic missionary, and a taxi driver who thinks he's a good guy.
Such people, for example, are involved in the smuggling of human beings into the European Union.
The criminologist Andrea Di Nicola and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci at the University of Trento have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers" and their book The Death Travel Agency is published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the tentacles of human smuggling, propose solutions, and present smugglers on different steps of the business.
HS presents five of them.
I'm gonna beat the hell out of them right now.
The Kerkenna Islands on the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians are heading there for the summer.
In terms of its location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, as the journey to the island of Lampedusa, which belongs to Italy, is only 120 kilometres away.
For comparison: distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is approximately 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, the captain burning in the chain and the father of six children.
Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimps, but it is more profitable for a fisherman to transport people.
That's what Emir has done with his blue, ten - foot [10 m] wooden boat hundreds of times.
If the boat is full, it can accommodate 40 people.
For one trip, Emir earns approximately 8,000 euros after expenses.
Emir has five assistants who are looking for clients all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until another outbreak of the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will house them in empty houses for as long as it pleases them.
Food is provided in such a way that customers barely survive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer runs out of money, that's their problem.
We leave for the water at midnight with a smothered lantern.
The first night is driven away from the islands, then stopped, waited for the day and driven the following night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and in 20 - meter - high waves passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir is on his way back.
Emir wants people to be afraid of him.
That's why he's beating his clients and at least claiming to beat the troublemakers to death.
He says in the book that once the police caught him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed customers one by one from the neck and threw them overboard," Emir says in the book.
The quietest passengers come from the south of the Sahara.
They say he's gonna have to abuse his countrymen for this.
I'm gonna beat the shit out of them right now.
We need to show them who's in charge right now.
Just a regular cab driver.
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.
His taxi isn't very good - the starter engine is running out and it's already seen its best days.
The most important thing for Goran's customers, however, is that the taxi is moving at all and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
A centre for asylum seekers is located next to the village, where families are mainly allowed.
In the surrounding forests, men travelling without their family stay in tents, lavage and abandoned cars, which has now been found or built by anyone.
Families living in the forest who, for one reason or another, have not applied for asylum in Serbia.
Some also stay in private apartments, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his clients.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans the route requires a large number of crossings and weeks of walking in difficult terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When people finally arrive at the Bogovaða area, the great node of human smuggling, they are dead tired.
Goran's riders are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best clients are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say things once and that's enough," Goran says.
He says the Africans are trying to compromise.
Goran won't like that.
He's a fool. He's a fool all the way.
First we agree on a price of EUR 300, for example, and then they lower it to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I don't care about the money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than the others and charges only EUR 50 per person for a ride to the Hungarian border.
It's about 200 miles away, most of the highway is nice.
I hear colleagues are asking for a triple or quadruple price.
Goran earns about 50 000 euros a year.
It is not a great sum for the smuggler, but it is a very nice annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered taxis not to be allowed to transport migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his rider a mile from the border.
Then he points his customers in the right direction and turns away.
At Work of Mercy
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called the Missionary, and that's not just a nickname.
Indeed, he has a Protestant church in Kampala, Uganda's capital, where many believers who have fled Congo are visited, and a small center that helps Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He sees himself doing the work of mercy.
It's important for the missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and makes sure that the rubber band of white underwear looks elegantly under the low waist of jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his SUV, and his three motorcycles.
When the missionary does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
The customer first calls one of the missionaries' five telephone numbers.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money gently, and slid into the cross - border peddlers.
In order to obtain the status of asylum seeker or refugee in Uganda, the authorities must be informed that they come from war zones such as North Kivu and that they have had to flee their home from violence.
Often it is true, but if not, the missionary arranges a new identity for the customer.
The old identity card will be destroyed and another one will be replaced.
The Missionary contacts with the Ugandan police will help.
The customer will then be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: asylum procedures, NGOs, eventually the UN Refugee Organisation (UNHCR).
The missionary knows bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He charges each step separately: submitting an application to the Ugandan police costs about EUR 100, managing documents for a humanitarian organisation about 150, and moving to a European country, for example, EUR 4 500-7,000.
Foliota and ice cubes
Tom is an inquiring smuggler, a former drug courier.
An Irishman in his 40s is on duty on the French coast of Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks on their way to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan, a French taxi driver in London, and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they are in the human smuggling business.
At night Tom and the taxi driver picked up their customers, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near Calais center.
They're driving the A26. They're trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would go straight to prison for illegal immigration.
Tom doesn't want that. He's been doing seven years for drugs.
A taxi stops, Tom and his clients run across the highway to a rest stop where the drivers sleep before they cross the canal to the British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck - to make sure it is on its way to England and not to Holland, for example - and cuts through the safety cable of the protective cover.
We have to do it quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver's in on it, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his client in aluminum foil, the same one that is wrapped around a roast or baked potato in the kitchen.
It should prevent a police heat scanner from detecting a hideout.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in a truck and leaves the scene hoping that he doesn't drive a lot of stowaways, at least not before Britain.
King of Smugglers
Muammer Kqk is one of the world's most famous human smugglers.
The up-and-coming Turk has been called the champion of marketing and the unquestionable king of illegal invasions of the Mediterranean, who controls sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.

He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only claims the money when he gets there.
One of the new methods is a luxury craft scheme: Turkish ports are supposed to rent yachts to take American or European families for a few days on tourist cruises.
In reality, ships are being loaded to the full by Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are being transported from Istanbul to a port and then to Europe by sea for a fee of between EUR 5 000 and EUR 7 000.
Customers are stored in human storage facilities, such as old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People are being crammed into minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They're told to hide among the vegetation and wait for the signal.
Once it's delivered, we'll have to board the ship quickly.
Passengers must stay the whole way below deck.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, for there are no other signs of the crowd.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.

An American Olympic runner tells about his illness and becoming a prostitute in his book
Three times in the Olympic Games, the new book by the 1,500 - meter runner Suzy Favor Hamilton has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book Fast Girl, tells of his career ending and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published fragments of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the games in top shape and ran at the qualifiers for the second best time.
At the final, however, he panicked.
From the very beginning, he rushed to the top and defended his leading position with a manic run.
However, 150 meters before the goal, his strength was exhausted.
He collapsed on the surface of the track, and he was passed one after another by the other rivals.
I felt like an idiot and I thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself over the goal line," says Favor Hamilton in his book.
Later, it was revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt tremendous pressure for success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of getting money for having sex with strange men.
He also persuaded his husband to accept his actions.
Favor Hamilton's rate was 450 euros an hour.
He says he spent the money on a luxury life.
Another explanation that Favor Hamilton had for becoming a prostitute was that he needed adrenaline spikes similar to those he had received when competing in athletics.
Later, Favor Hamilton discovered that he was suffering from bipolar disorder.
The double life of a former star runner was revealed at the end of 2012 when the Smoke Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton attended the Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was 3,57,40 feet [1,500 m] of world statistics at the time, but was the last in the Sydney Olympic Final.
The world champion rejoiced when the Federation disciplined the Norwegian ski rooster: "Straightback"
The Norwegian ski king, Petter Northug, has exceeded the limits of suitability in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Like last summer and autumn, Northug and the Norwegian Ski Association have been twisting the sports contract.
Although the Union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been good enough for many world champions and Olympic winners.
The Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northug from the World Cup of the coming season.
The decision was praised by the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said that he was glad that the union controlled the ski rooster.
"Thank you for pointing at the spine," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the union sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Association and Northug is about money.
Northug apparently wants to be part of the season's national team so he can advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent a union that would also care for future generations and would not allow one athlete to play solos.
At the same time, he recalled that the Union has granted Northug financial and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has a completely different set of rules than just because he is the best.
On Tuesday, Northug published his own press release in which he assured us that he would like to play in Norwegian colours next season in the World Cup and then in the World Cup and the Olympic Games.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six World Championships in her career, two of which were gold.
He was on the team that won the message gold last winter in Falun.
Roast translators' shield day is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On S.H.I.E.L.D. Day 25.9. there will be stunts in various restaurants and shops that have been awarded the Roast Translators' Plate.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high-quality food industry and lower the threshold for going to a restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, we would like to point out that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the capital region, but the top restaurants inspected and rated by an impartial operator are located all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the significance of the event as a part of increasing the awareness of the restaurants and the organisation.
The day is held in Vaasa in restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola there is a restaurant in Old Town.
The event has also received significant international attention.
The decision has therefore been made to make the event one of the most significant international events in the organisation, which will take place on the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland will remain the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: The Finnish Attorney General has been consulted on the establishment of the Kauhava office.
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to set up a refugee reception centre at the premises of the ex-apartment of Kauhava currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the region is still permanently situated in critical infrastructure of the crisis period, which is used by the armed forces and its partner, the Finnish independent network Oy.
Kauhajoki magazine reports that according to a private individual, placing a reception centre in the same building would constitute a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the armed forces may have interests in the area and airport of the former Air War School, the impact of which has also not been clarified during the preparation of the reception centre, the newspaper writes.
The case states that there have been negotiations over the last two years with regard to the Kauhava airport on the organisation of flight training and the arrival of a potential foreign operator at the airport.
This issue has been discussed with the Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (p.a.) and the Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Defence Arto Rädy.
A private person states to the Attorney General that the complaint is not a matter of objecting in principle to the reception centre, but that the planned location in the former garrison area is wrong.
The City Council of Kauhava dealt with the reception center issue last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Governance means that immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions," Niinistö commented to the journalists at night after meeting the presidents of all parliamentary parties at his official residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, concerns about the management of the refugee situation united all participants.
He considers it valuable that in Finland government and opposition parties are able to discuss the underlying issues confidentially.
Especially in these times when we face great challenges
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria, as well as Russia's and the United States' actions in the region, can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, the Baltic Sea region.
Niinistö is hopeful about the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, namely that of the United States and Russia, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the tension in the Baltic Sea.
According to Niinistö, the question of NATO was also addressed in the discussions.
The president did not comment on the labour market situation.

Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, communications need a wide range of channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches are one of the others.
This kind of direct speech channel will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä told journalists in Parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess the frequency of the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be delivered on Yle's channels.
If other channels register as a channel, we'll see.
Now let's use this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires the provision of television and radio speech to citizens.
This dossier, which we are talking about here, is quite complex and requires a longer justification.
That's why we ended up on this channel, Sipilä figured it out.
The speech will be broadcast from 21.05 to 21.20 both on TV1 and Radio in Finland.
You can also watch it in Yle Arena.
Squirrel's taking a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä's television talk will not tell us about a more general turn inside the government.
Is it an attempt to take the right of definition of public debate more strictly into its own hands and to refuse to discuss the questions raised by the public debate?
It reminds me of Mr Soin's recent comment that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define himself.
In the interests of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these matters are not related.
Koivunen understands that commercial media is indignant about Sipilä's announcement.
It would be strange if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not announcements in democracy.
It is the role of the media, by definition, to ensure that political agendas are not adopted.
According to Koivuse, television speech is a big risk to Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table to meet the exceptionally high expectations of the speech.
Is there more of what we have already heard today?
Or can he speak in a different tone, in a different way or in different words or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old thing, one must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
In this respect, the public is taking a risk if it is not a specific situation but a routine speech among others.
There is a risk that Yle will be branded as a communicator of politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in the interest of Yle or in the general direction.
♪ A clever bet from a stilt ♪
What is also important in the future speech of Sipilä is what the Prime Minister fails to say, the media researcher stresses.
In the evening, we should look carefully at what Sipilä is missing and what she is not missing from," says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to the Moon, TV talk is a clever move from Sipilä, as this allows him to express his own view without gravel sounds.
This will give the message a public audience without a journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
Sipilä bypasses the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a danger that the media will interpret something wrong because there will be no more specific questions.
According to the moon, it's very important how Sipilä performs on TV - whether the sweat is dripping, the hands are shaking.
He compares Sipilä to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can make a good point, it can work.
The situation is different from that if the government were to inform something, because here a person is speaking directly to another person.
This is what Obama and his partners do regularly ( United States President Barack).
That's really unusual.
Political researcher Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to the public to be truly exceptional.
He said that it has not happened in decades that the Prime Minister should speak directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means," says Railo.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister wants to make the Finns sympathetic to the blackmail that lies ahead.
On Friday, employee organisations will organise demonstrations and strikes against government action.
Paavo Arhinmäki, Chairman of the Left Alliance, says on Twitter that Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a Prime Minister's announcement, so that the speech could also be discussed.
Antti Rinne (SDP president) again announces that he is challenging Sipilä's dialogue.
This is no time for monologues.
Soon six months after the election.
You can't hide in the endless world, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A nine-year-old boy on the run has been found in Tampere.
The boy was fine when we found him.
The boy's been found, and the boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The Police Department of Inland Finland also confirms the matter to Iltälehti.
The boy went out to play at 4:00 in the afternoon.
Later last night, she was no longer in touch.
My father thanks all the people who helped me find him.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed more than 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time.
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed by the violent fad of young people: You create hatred
Makwan Amirkhani, a free fighter with a Kurdish background, released a video on Facebook, which particularly appeals to young people with an immigrant background.
Makwan Amirkhani gave a heavy speech against street fighting among young people.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and arriving in Finland with his family at the age of five, has so far won both his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series in the championship.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking me to look at an Instagram account.
There are videos on the account where young people fight with extreme violence.
Amirkhani tells me he's disappointed in the young people's fad.
Amirkhan, 26 years old, has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick down the ground, sit on one of them, and hit them blindly without thinking about any of these consequences, what this will do when you do this kind of videos, Amirkhani updates.
It's hard to defend anymore.
Some of the young people seen in the videos are of immigrant origin.
According to Chief Inspector Jarmo Heinonen of the Helsinki Police Department, fighting videos have been downloaded by immigrants and young people from Finland.
It's the fact that you're fighting at the top of the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, Amirkhani in Turku reminds us.
Amirkhani reminds us that there are sites in Finland that are looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have come up with an outrageous number.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you any longer.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be guests here for quite a long time.
That's a different way to thank you for being here, Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever become victims of racism, you will blame yourself for it.
Think about it a couple of times before you go along with something like that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action is a contribution to racism.
You guys make me hate that I don't like either.
You've got a pretty bad thing going on, and you're not gonna make it any better anyway, Amirkhani decides.
SAK pledges its position on the austerity package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
On Twitter, the President of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, explains that the employee association will discuss its position on the alternative savings list presented by the STTK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK's proposal on Twitter.
Earlier on Wednesday, the staff centre association GTK announced that it would present its own proposal to the government to achieve the 5% productivity leap demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk).
Mr Sture Fjäder, President of Akava, believes that the proposal will be approved by the government if the SAK, STTK and Arava are all behind it.
However, it would require that the largest employee organisation SAK soften its previous position.
The President of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, made a few comments on Twitter.
Mrs Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open up the labour market lock" and that agreements concluded by active parties are needed instead of coercive laws.
Mrs Lyly points out that Mr Sipilä's proposal for a social agreement was not acceptable to the SAK.
In the past, Mr Sipilä interrupted negotiations on a social contract when the SAK refused to commit itself to the 5% productivity leap target.
Comment: The grand demonstration is threatening to go "It feels a little funny to thrash your fist"
It seems a little funny to put a fist in your pocket if you already have a settlement paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
Atmospherics vary from side to side in an employee camp.
Is it supposed to call the government down, or is it supposed to make a deal with it?
On Monday, s.K.A.'s union leaders were blowing out holy hatred for the government of the republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened with catching up.
The threat spread to the Akavaans.
The teachers' union OAJ threatened to close schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, OAJ withdrew: no school or kindergarten will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), chairman of the STTK staff centre organisation, appeared conciliatoryly.
He said that he had kept in touch with the government and that he would produce an alternative proposal called for by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk) as a 5% productivity leap.
The President of Akava, Mr Sture Fjäder, hastened to announce immediately that his settlement papers have already been completed.
At first, there wasn't a sound from the S.K.A. office.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to reach an agreement when it was on Monday that the union leaders ordered the country to stand on Friday.
Finally, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK would look for solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order to create a collective performance of employees, the SAK should be inclined to accept a 5% productivity leap as an objective.
It is no wonder that Palola's STTK has relations with Sipilä's government.
The right hand of Palola, Jukka Ilmous, Director of Social Impact at STTK, previously served as a special assistant to the central prime ministers Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
In fact, Palola described the government's expertise as improving all the time.
A coincidence or no coincidence, but Palola's exit took a little boost away from Finland's stoppers, whose front shot was the ACP Marko Pieinen (sd).
I mean, it's kind of funny to put a fist in your pocket if you already have a settlement paper in your pocket.
Edited at 6 p.m.: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
Sergey Naryshkin, President of the Russian Duma, criticised the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
The President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, felt that Mongolia was a better OSCE host than Finland.
In the capital of Mongolia, Ulan Bator, a September session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun in which Naryshkin made extensive comments on the Helsinki Festival in July.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who had been forced into the European Union to attend a meeting - a matter on which the President was able to remind journalists.
According to our estimates, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed according to the news agency Interfax.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU but also at the United States, where his access had also been blocked.
Sanctions are a political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation was uncomplicated, so Naryshkin continued to pick up on Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for its "excellent organisation".
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting that took place in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue should not be hindered.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (kok), the leader of the meeting at Ulan Bator, who, according to Russian media, has already spoken with the Russian delegation.
The lock meets the real playoff troll: "The paint is tight"
Tappara and the Clave will continue today in Hakametsi as they are both on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that today we won't see a real goal party in Hakametsi.
Tappara went to Kuopio yesterday to carve 3-2-coffee from KalPa.
The rise was manly, for last season's silver team was at its worst the loss of two goals.
The lock's Tuesday was a lot more winning than it was.
The Rauman catch as a guest of Blues, who started a tangled start, was round zero points, and the loss figures were also 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if any play the same game as last year, Locker Janne Lahti anticipates layouts on the Society's website.
Tappara has become quite a playoff nightmare for the people of Rauma.
After all, Tappara has dropped the Clave in the semifinals in the previous two periods.
On both occasions, a decisive seventh match has been required.
Last season, the Clave took the series to the break in the fourth game, but Tappara rose in the next three by and by.
With the exception of goalies, there are no major changes in group configurations.
The cashiers who rejected both of them yesterday are getting a flute today.
With Tapara's goal Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Bear, and between the Clave poles Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Point of view: Ässissa is in the middle of a miserable play
The sports director Toivola wrote an inappropriate sequel to the head coach Rautakallio," writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote a Rocky movie in which he himself played the leading role.
Sensationally, the underdog struggled with the heavyweight champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a great deal of sympathy, even though he finally lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's premiere, Mika Toivola wrote a restless Cinderella story in Pori.
The anonymous and wooden casserole advanced to everyone's amazement at the SM finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but tough underdogs like Rocky.
There were white Indians, Pori Matt and Pele Pelto.
In the playoffs, the players dyed their heads red and cut the lorokes.
Hope child became blonde.
J.P. Jalo called the coach Neumann.
Aces took the silver that was won.
Hope was one of the heroes.
The writer Toivola believes that the new work of this season will work in the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports director of the Äss have built a casserole on bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been banging guys in the trough like Rocky pig carcasses at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen have earned something other than hockey.
Toivola has forgotten that in Rocky VI the lead is played by Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Stone has crossed the Iron Rock into Sean Connery.
The Iron Rock is as clumsy a lead performer as Connery would have been in the original 1976.
There's nothing else in Iron Rock but a nickname.
The game philosophy of iron rock does not include rushing and little pigs.
He appreciates the tough game, but it's one thing to play hard than a pig.
Last season, Ässien Garrett Stafford hit Tapara Jere Karjalainen on the head.
He got 2 plus 10 minutes from the judges, but Iron Rock put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only have those who deserve to play.
I don't approve of that kind of game, and it's not part of the ace hockey, the hot Iron Rock got a little cranky after the game for the Satakunta People.
The team of Ässien this season is strangely built.
There are juniors, veterans, cops, and bulldozers.
In practice, there are no key men of prime age.
No wonder the head coach's been complaining about a skill shortage.
How much have you been able to influence the acquisitions of players, Pekka Rautakallio?
Last season's events affect procurement and, unfortunately, the situation on the market was rather limited, Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
Underneath the surface, it's pulsating.
In the 1953 model, Rautakallio is known to be interested in moving to Toivola as a sports boss.
The men's contracts end in the spring.
The Äss' balance in the three league games of the season is as many losses in goal difference 1-6.
Hopela shouldn't have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santas' mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuukka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under the guidance of her husband.
Yes, I'm playing the mother of a friend of my husband's.
In a way, it seems crazy, and the actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
He has been married to Apulanna's ex-basist and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple has done a lot of work together before, but this is the first time Olga has played under Tuuka's direction.
Olga's role in Apulana's film "You Made Us Beautiful" is drummer Sipe Santasuki's mother Sirkka.
Sirkka tsemppa and supports his son, even though his father, Risto (presented by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I have become acquainted with my real role model, the easier it seems to be to play the role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuukka for trusting me with the role.
Olga had already met Sirka before the film project, but since then, the two of them have become much closer.
They've met. They've spoken on the phone. They've been texting.
Sirkka has helped so much.
We've been through a lot of different angles of their history.
Sirkka is also fortunate to understand that drama is drama and the truth may need some coloring.
Olga points out that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulana would become the largest band in Finland.
In the '90s, there was a recession and it was really sad.
There was little chance that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga tells us that she had heard a lot about Tuukka's youth even before the movie plans.
However, parents' stories have sometimes been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were doing.
Olga reveals that her youth was completely different from that of Tuukka, known as Heinola's infamous skate story.
Olga was an ark and a good girl who had nothing to do with Tuukka.
At the most, he could have secretly fallen in love.
According to Olga, he has worked so hard with Tuuka over the past 10 years that a big joint project does not scare him.
Everything has always gone super well.
Now the entire production team is leaving for a month's shoot in Heinola.
True, a couple living in Italy often plans to drive home for the sake of their young children because the distance is not too long.
We take all Heinola for a month.
They have welcomed us very warmly, simply asking which ones will repent and when will be emptied.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive play in Finland
The budget for the Iron Sky: The Coming Race film directed by Timo Vuorensola is EUR 17 million.
Descriptions will begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola starts filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
The sequel of the Scifi film Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will become Finland's most expensive play film of all time with a budget of EUR 17 million.
Previously, the title of Finland's most expensive film has been Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation will also rise after completion of Iron Sky 2, with a budget of over EUR 100 million.
Descriptions of the film directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa start in October near Antwerp in the AED Studios premises and last eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola will leave for Belgium next week.
A giant budget doesn't scare me.
I've been so sick and relaxed!
I feel so relaxed about the script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone in the task force seems to realize that we're doing something we've never seen before.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, he'll tell the Evening Magazine.
Originally, the budget for the film had been set at 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
It's a big budget, but it's a big story.
But you could shove 100 million into the film because every angle and effect is so expensive.
Now everything's so tight, it's not loose.
The film production company Iron Sky Universe launched today a crowdfunding campaign and a bond with an annual interest rate of between 4 and 8 per cent.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
In two years at the latest, the company will repay the loan.
The action film is played by Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junk or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Lately, the fronts of the Trendsters have been decorated with large logos.
Until recently, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
The advertising of a hoodie or a T-shirt was seen as a bit of a hillbilly.
It's times that change.
Sporting has become the real megatrend of fashion, and so have old, familiar sport fashion characters such as Adidas and Nike.
And as so often before, the line between funny and trendy is fluctuating: if something is already a real hillbilly, it begins to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. the mundane fashion, where the trendsetters surprised by favouring basic clothes that are as boring as possible as a way to separate themselves from the mass.
Now, instead of the grey standard college, you're going to have to put on that sweat shirt buried at the bottom of the closet, which is shown in front of the manufacturer's logo.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, Adidas's identifiable track-finders, favorite team's jerseys and New York Yankees hats have made a return to street fashion.
The beginning of the jeans' edge is now a cool detail for the Calvin Klein logos of the underwear.
The trend seems to be moving from sport brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the front of Versace's autumn sweaters makes it clear what clothing is to be worn.
Would you be ready to display logos in your dress?
The Russian politician released the evidence: I didn't get stuck in the tank door for hours!
According to claims, a special incident would have taken place in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015 was introduced to Russian war industry products.
In recent days, there have been colorful claims in the Russian media that the Russian Ministry of Emergency had to remove large Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything in his power to deny the information.
He even published a picture on his own public Facebook pages, where he seems to be peeking at the armored vehicle hatch in quite good moods and, at least, from those images, it's not about getting stuck or getting angry.
It's total nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't enter the battle tank, but it was the assault tank BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier myself, Lieutenant Colonel. I've served the Urals.
I went in there, looked around and came out in peace, Zotov said to Komosomolskaja Pravda.
I didn't get stuck, and I certainly didn't spend five hours in that position," he said.
On the Russian army TV channel Zotov explained that he saw Russian new technology in the exhibition because he was a former professional soldier himself.
That's why I was interested in what was inside the carriage, and I admired our technique.
And out I came through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And in the next exhibition I will definitely visit all the tanks and all the assault tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the writer a fool.
One fool wrote and all the others repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went in, and I came out.
I'm tall, I'm fat, but nothing like being stuck somewhere in a tank, it didn't happen," he said to Russkaya sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged sticking have been published, even though 50 000 people visited the weapons exhibition in a few days' time.
The claim that Zotov got stuck started in the case of the Bloknot.ru website, where Zotov was told that he was struggling to get out of the tank door and threatened eventually to shoot everyone around him if he didn't get out of his way.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up article in which the exhibition organizers gave their views on what happened.
Everyone is just used to soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles quickly.
But MP Zotov, due to his large size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he certainly did not sit there for five hours," said the exhibition coordinator Alexander Pisarevsky to Bloknot.
Here's a favorite item of interior bloggers.
The Architects Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) Lassen's candlestick from 1962 looks like it was planned today.
A cubed steel frame is like a work of art, and it was originally a work of art.
Architect brothers are known to have long and mathematically refined the shape of the chandelier.
At first it was introduced only to the distinguished guests of the gentlemen's dinner.
Kubus candles are manufactured by the family company By Lassen, which maintains the design heritage of famous brothers.
The candles are handmade in Holstebro, Denmark, in versions of eight, four and one candles, in four different colours.
The Kubu can be black, white and the nickel and copper shakes.

Check the video to see what effects stoppages have on road and rail transport - both goods and passengers.
Air transport is its own number.
It is severely shaken by strike action at least around noon, but the reflections are likely to continue until Saturday.

There has been a leak in the Kittilän mine of Agnico Eagle Finland, a Canadian-owned mining company.
The refined process water from the gold mine has been drained from the so-called enrichment pool into a ditch.
According to the company, measures to correct the leak have been initiated.
The pool contains neutralised enrichment sand and purified process water from the foaming process.
In general, water is pumped either for re-use as process water or led through the surface drainage field to the environment as agreed.
The bleeding was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was observed.
According to the company, the quality of leakage water meets the current permit conditions.
There was no other material in the environment.
The leak was detected during the inspection round on Monday morning.
The leak has not been found to cause structural damage to the dam structures of the pool.
The company reports that it cooperates closely with the authorities to monitor and remedy the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish country report published today by the IMF largely follows the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation pushed Finland towards comprehensive structural reforms to deal with economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the whole contractual system and for unemployment protection.
According to Danske Bank's chief economist Pasi Kuoppamäki, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
The IMF's assessment contains a lot of sympathetic messages for government action, but on the other hand, there are also words of warning about what should not be cut too much.
These include infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki says to Talous sanomat.
In the view of the IMF, growth projects should also be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF anticipates economic growth of 0.4% for Finland this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
Danske expects this year, in his new forecast for the economic cycle, that growth will fall to zero.
The IMF is a little more optimistic about this year.
They may have had some of the latest observations.
This morning Statistics Finland reported that total output was growing slightly in the summer," Kuoppamäki says.
Less attention could be paid to the weakened industry's confidence or other so-called softer indicators.
However, these differences are limited to a few percentage points.
Nintendo, who was recovering from death, appointed a new leader.
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will start working on Wednesday," Nintendo told me on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for launching a successful Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to track Iwata's footprints, evaluated by Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
Kimishima's task is to bring Nintendo into mobile games strongly, but not to eat the company's bread on the side of traditional gaming consoles.
More and more minor asylum seekers arrive alone in Finland
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service recognised that hundreds of children who have entered the country disappear every year.
According to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of minor applicants disappear each year, among other things, on their websites OSF.se and Dagens Nyheter.
The Finnish Immigration Service's Chief Inspector Juha Kannelmaa tells us what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is it the same in Finland?
How many applicants disappear "under the country" per year?- A total of 156 applications for asylum were made in Finland in 2013.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014, similar applications were made in 196 and 11 of them disappeared," says Kannelmaa.
The reason for this disappearance may be that it is clear from the case that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of age there.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue the proceedings in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for examining the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, the total number of asylum seekers in Finland was 3651, of which 134 were closed because the applicant had probably moved away from Finland, so that adult asylum seekers disappeared in the last 123 years," he says.
Is the number on the increase?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum for a minor who has come alone.
The overall statistics on missing minors this year are not yet available, but the number of minors applicants is known and has increased clearly, which is likely to also affect the number of missing persons, he stresses.
What about those who have been converted?
Will they also disappear, for example, into the "dark labour market"?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for implementing the decisions to convert, Kannelmaa stresses.
Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered applicants.
He has taken action on this issue.
At the EU Home Affairs Council, Orpo, who discussed refugee issues, explained on Monday how to manage the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see pictures of the equipment
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkose for TV and radio productions is now available for sale.
Mikkonen's spouse Nina Mikkonen sells equipment at Huuto.net, which was once one of the most advanced professional tools in her field.
The online announcement was the first one to tell about the online magazine Nightmacan.
Today, a large part of the equipment has been overshadowed by technological progress.
In the digital media world, television shows are no longer on Betacam.
However, Nina Mikkonen is confident that there will be interested ones.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date, but these are needed as long as there is old generation material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of enthusiasts - collectors and studio builders, Nina Mikkonen says to IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset is trying to move out of his current home in the Stormlän.
There's no way we can take all the stuff with us.
I've gradually begun to inventory and see what goods are being disposed of.
This is where I started," says Nina Mikkonen.
There is no use for TV and radio equipment.
After recent strokes, it is clear that the man who made a long career will never return to work again.
Nina Mikkonen points out that only goods and equipment are sold now.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen's actual life's work was filed at the National Audiovisual Institute in the summer, whose representatives went to pick up boxes of films and other material from Stormylä.
Traffic threatens to grow worse than expected: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
Metro and tram drivers today decide whether to extend the force measures in connection with Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram traffic only during Friday's demonstration.
During the afternoon, it will be resolved whether traffic will stop all day.
Pekka Hirvonen, head of trust, says that he's big on the field.
The cuts in the night and shift lines are very painful for the drivers, so the government's plans to cut the flats raise opposition.
Hirvonen thinks that stopping traffic all day, however, is a sort of dilemma.
If the metro and tram stop by Friday, public transport in the Greater Helsinki area is almost completely at a standstill.
According to VR's data, trains do not run between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Friday.
On Friday, there is no commuter or long distance traffic.
Trains left before 6 a.m. will be driven to the stations of destination.
According to HSL's data, most of the buses remain in the depot.
ACP Members are absent from work on Friday from 3 a.m. to 3 a.m. Saturday morning at 3 a.m.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven; they are driven by superiors, according to Pirkko Repo, HSL's publicist.
Repo says HSL can't tell you exactly which bus services are scheduled on Friday.
The employees' organisations organise a major demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Market on Friday between 11 am and 13 pm.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place on the Hungarian-Serbia border, where many refugees are trying to move on to Europe, reports the news agency AP.
Sky News says the refugees have been trying to break through the border fence.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water cannons against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at a school in Texas, and the teacher thought it was a bomb.
In the United States of America, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested since the teacher held the self-made watch he brought to school as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that all he wanted to do was show off his electronic hobby.
However, one of the teachers considered the clock to be like a bomb.
The police were called, and the situation ended with the boy being handcuffed to a juvenile detention cell.
At no point has Mohammed been found to have claimed anything other than that he had made a watch.
Yet it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a fake bomb.
Mohamed said the police had found that the watch looked like a movie bomb.
The watch is in police custody, but it was reportedly composed of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident occurred last Monday and Mohamed was punished for three days of compulsory school leave.
His father is furious about the case and the American-Islamic Council is wondering whether this case is yet another demonstration of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain's tumultuous - Labour leader refused to sing the national anthem
In the song, God is asked to protect the queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism of the right-wing press has also been shared by the representatives of the Corbyn Labour Party.
This has offended the people, said Labour MP Kate Green in a radio interview with the BBC.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
Last night's memorial service honored the battle of British air force pilots against German Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corbyn in an official statement and stresses that he has shown respect for the pilots by participating in the event.
We all owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood with respect in silence during the national anthem, the statement was emphasized.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided Labour's ranks.
Among the MPs, in particular, are those who fear that he will banish moderate voters with his radical views.
Corby is in favour of unilateral disarmament, ending austerity measures and increasing public spending.
Today, for the first time, Corbyn is to be a party leader in Parliament at Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what should be asked of Prime Minister David Cameron.
At the turn of the week Cameron was on Twitter about Corbyn's election as party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, our financial security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister tweeted in his own account.
The reason for the family killing in Minnesota is still unclear - the father of the family was facing a lawsuit.
The South Lake Mintonka Police Department has been investigating the family murder in Greenwood, Minnesota for almost a week.
A family of five was found dead in their home on September 10, and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the family's father, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting first his wife and three children, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days.
The family was found after the school had been concerned about the absence of children.
Based on this announcement, the police went to the house for a visit and found the Short family dead across a huge house.
According to StarTribune, it's possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A million-dollar house and a successful business
The case of Michael Siitar, Chief of Police of South Lake Mintonka, is still under investigation.
The motive for the blood work is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property on the social media site AllNurses.com for nurses.
In 2014, in an interview with StarTribune Short reported that there were four million different visitors to the site every week.
I've had 50 bids made for the company in the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to put into practice.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
Among other things, success was shown by the fact that the Short family bought a hilarious house in Greenwood in 2011 for $2 million.
The house is advertised as the dream of a car collector in Zillow: the house has not only 12 rooms but also a garage sufficient for eight cars.
A case pending
But according to StarTribune, the father of the family was facing a lawsuit.
Achieve Test Prep, offering various prepping courses, had sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, no abusive comments had been removed from Short's website and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on Short's transactions.
Vesku Loiri offered me a coffee cake.
In addition, the owner's trio was awarded at the race event with the Finnish Hippos Monthly Horse Owner Award.
This is great. Loiri commented in good mood on his honor board.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100 000 euros.
Artist legend Loiri was still confused by Fabrice Duo's success in the major competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
According to Loir, Coach Raven of the Success Horse will have complete peace of mind while working with the horse.
Pekka orders and decides where to take the horse to compete.
And I'm gonna shut up, Loiri.
It's an amazing gesture from an NHL star - "The greatest contribution ever made by an athlete"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated ten million dollars (about 6.7 million euros) to Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the hospital's announcement, this is the greatest single donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital with other fundraising for the next seven years.
A year ago, Subban signed a contract with the Canadiens worth eight years and 72 million dollars.
Subban's donation is thus significantly higher than his $9 million annual income.
As a reward for his donation, Subban receives a lobby space bearing his name from the hospital.
Canadiens players have done much to help local hospitals in the past.
A year ago, long-term captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a giant sum of money for another city's major hospital to get the PET scanner needed for cancer research.
A Japanese café can be ordered by a wife for the evening, serving food with a bikini and an apron on its head.
Theme cafes are tough in Japan.
There's already a goat café, a rabbit café, a vampire café, a hug shop and now a wife café.
It strikes the lonely, the sore, the hungry.
There's a Metro report.
You can order a wife or husband for your evening at an Ore no Yome (My wife) café in Tokyo.
It's a waitress pretending to be the client's spouse.
The "half-family" is selected from the list before coming to the café and he prepares and serves the food.
The wife is facing an apron and a bikini with her husband in tight bike shorts.
The website provides all the information about the length of the wife candidates and always places pressure on the type of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: attacks against car security began to be armed
The Automation Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the sector, says Intel's release.
The Board is composed of top experts in the field of security from around the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections to standardise best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of best practices in cybersecurity.
The company will update the report on the basis of the ASRB's research results.
The international ICT research and consulting company Gartner estimates that by 2020 approximately 150 million vehicles in traffic will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share network-based data.
We can and must improve cybersecurity in cars," says Chris Young, Director of Intel Security.
With the help of ASRB, Intel can consolidate safety-related best practices and support the view that cybersecurity is a significant ingredient in the design of every car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in data processing.
Ford Focus RS costs approximately 52 000 euros in Finland!
Ford's Focus RS model has been expected for years like a moon-rise.
Finally, the car is also on the horizon in Finland.
Ford released RS's information now that the car world's eyes are at the Frankfurt Car Show.
Ford's new four-wheeled RS accelerates with its 2.3-litre, 350-horsepower engine in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and has a peak speed of 266 kilometers per hour.
The price is also interesting according to Finnish, and it is provisionally reported to be EUR 52 000.
The car is already available to order, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford does not state in his release.
The favourite brand Kia introduced two new features at the Frankfurt car show - the new Sportage and Optima
In Finland, the new fourth generation Sportage is certainly more important than the two new ones, with which Kia plans to grab a larger slice of the constantly growing SUV market.
The Sportage created under the leadership of Gregory Guillaume, the new European Design Director, is more round than before.
An inch has come into the space between the axles and the external dimensions, and the car splits the air more efficiently.
The engine range is broadly unchanged, but a 1.6-litre turbo with 177 horsepower has been added.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported closer to coming to the market.
We will have to wait a little longer for that, as we will have a new Sportage in spring 2016.
Even before the year's change, new Kia Optimat arrived in our country.
Suddenly, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a whole new car.
Kia plans to conquer the hearts of upper middle class buyers with better driving characteristics, lower noise levels and higher quality equipment.
The starting point is to obtain Optimos with 1.7-litre turbodiesel and 2.0-litre petrol engines.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate as Optima GT, equipped with a 2.0-litre turbo engine, arrives alongside them.
At the same time, the sales of Optima Farmer begin with its arrival.
Chisu went back to the pallets in a bold jumpsuit.
Singer Chisu is at the Life for the Child concert with other Finnish stars.
There's a nice, open neck hole in an electric-blue pants suit.
The costume presents beautifully the slender waist of the singer star.
The whole thing is crowned by a golden metal belt and a red lipstick.
During a three - year break, a singer who has become a mother has been able to lose her weight with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to turn into a year.
The singer released her first single on a new album in August.
I'm not really nervous about getting back on stage and getting in front of the public after a long break.
I've missed all the music-related activities, the singer says.
In a couple of weeks, Chisu will release his new and fourth album called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired the creation of new songs.
At this point I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu will think.
Kim Kardashian's maternity style is astounding again. Now you see the breast.
The true beauty Kim Kardashian gives talks one after another.
He presents his pregnant stomach and chest equipment freely in sexy clothes, last night at one American time when he and his sister Kourtney Kardashian left husband Kanye West's concert.
The black maternity dress is transparent on the breasts.
It reveals the color of the bra under the dress as lightning lights flash.
The last time Kardashian wore an Amazonic maternity dress was when he visited a friend at a dinner party in New York just a few days ago.
The outfit was highlighted by black overpile boots.
The third special maternity outfit is as fresh as last week's Friday, when the show was in pregnancy.
The hard laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, competition is terrible
The top model Manon Leloup wanted to shorthand the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary "Speaking Dolls" in which Leloup and his colleagues speak out of the model business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar compiled Leloup's six hard truths from behind the scenes.
Every season starts out of nowhere.
Even if you were in top designer costumes in the previous season, the new season will begin again with Castings.
And every season, new, fresh faces come into the industry that compete with corporates for work.
Models rarely have a place to call home.
The work is continuous travel and may take a year to stay in a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearable.
New York and Paris are the jobs they want, but they're the most stressful.
There's not just one kind of skinnyness.
Agent New York may ask to drop kilos, but in Paris they say you're too skinny.
Getting a job is always a risky game.
In fashion weeks, models and designers are always together and act as a support network at the same time.
When fashion weeks are over, it's a pain in the ass.
The models want this sector to be able to do so, but they are consumed by the fact that everyone thinks that work is just a showdown of clothes.
Even models want to be their own personalities.
Work makes models feel like they're actors with a role.
But you can also express yourself in the work of the model.
Models yesterday at Tory Burch's show.
New York is currently celebrating fashion weeks, where designers will reveal their next year's collection.
Scrooge Salminen, who changed his style, plays the most unknown Apulanta musician in the film.
Scrooge Salminen performs Antti Lautala, the founding member of the band, in a film based on the Apulanta band in the early years.
Lautala founded Apulana in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but resigned from the band in 1994.
It's a big challenge for me, because I'm a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitar player, Salminen laughs.
I've never wanted to meet the real Antti before the shoot because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Clearly, Antti is the most unknown to people in that group, so I think it's all right that I learn his play style only from video.
I don't want to do an impression of a human being.
A man who pilotes the Scrooge Salminen and the Dogs band will not go into character.
The Punk Manners come naturally with the man.
I'm sure there were a lot of people who saw a foretaste in the punk episode of Stars, Stars, and Stars, if they've ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been anything small, but we always go to the fullest.
The main actors in Tuukka Temonen, who played bass in Apula in 1993-2004, were announced today.
The group of young actors who have become familiar with the audience is presented to the general public by young actors who are still quite unknown.
The drummer Sipe Santapukki is played by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtasta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Timosta Iiro Panula.
Scrooge Salminen gave a tip about his future job last night when he mysteriously told Snapchat that he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Scrooge has already published yesterday in Instagram a picture of his new look that he has had to carry out for the film.
Scrooge, previously seen in the mustache and chin beard, has shaved his face into smooth cheeks and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to think about how to tell the child about the situation of refugees seeking to enter Europe.
Or is it worth telling you about it at all?
You don't have to talk about it by force, member of the SPR crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
Smaller children are worth protecting, not letting them watch the news alone, for example.
Small children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay in mind and distress, he says.
However, if a child has come across a television news picture of refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth talking about.
It is good to have a discussion about the child's starting points and to listen carefully to what he asks.
The child's fears may be surprising.
They may not be the ones the parent thinks he is afraid of.
You don't want to scare a child for nothing, even if you're anxious and scared.
A smaller child closely follows the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will feel safe too.
Larger children are likely to come across a discussion about refugees at school, with friends or online.
Parents do well to bring it up with them if the child is concerned.
The fact is, not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents, together with children, may wonder how this is viewed in our family.
In the end, however, do we think the world is a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational aspects - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand, if the family also talks about difficult things, the child will get a model of how to deal with the difficulties that arise in life.
This could be useful for him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljanmaa: "Teach your children to help the weaker"
Your own strength at the end?
You can still be a good parent to your child
It's hard to control the Pallosalamaa that hits Vermo.
Perttu Pohjola was able to fine-tune Apila's Pallosalama in midsummer.
It was only going to win and take second place until the end of July in Tampere raves came to collapse.
Since the stallion was completely clotted, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered an appointment with the vet.
The explanation for the shutdown was clear in the lookout.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not the mildest in the head, but it took two pills to overcome it.
Since Apila's Pallosalama had to be in light exercise, Pohjola says that he is positively surprised by the last race of the horse.
It was in Turku in its record time the second SE-mother after the wind of legend.
The Pallosalama of Apila was under great pressure from the break when it had normally only been able to drive for a few weeks.
In view of those things, the slight deflection at the end was understandable, says the North.
The coach assumes that a proper competition was good for the stallion.
The horse's spirit certainly went on from there, and hopefully it would also have stabilized.
Apila's Pallosalama has been called humorous horses.
When you haven't had the pleasure, it could have thrown you fat without getting sick.
On a good day, however, the Ori have been cut off by such a lightning bolt that the opponents have been amazed.
In short speed, rivals can't compete with Pallosalama, who even loses warm-blooded rides.
In the hopes of the North there is a race in Vermo.
But the different thing is, how does Apila's Pallosalama agree to it?
It's kind of hard at the time of departure, and you know, it might pop under the boom of the starting car or something like that.
I hope the stallion is calmer by now than Turku's departure.
Apilan Pallosalama can also come from the bow when he is well, and we're going to ride it for victory, coach says.
This is why you can't get rid of useless iPhone programs.
Tim Cook, CEO of Apple.
At least some of the software that comes with Apple's iPhone phones may be able to be deleted sometime in the future - but not all.
Apple will possibly remove some of its own software from iPhone phones in the future," says Tim Cook, CEO of the company in an interview with Buzzfeed magazine.
Apple's iPhone features a number of programs that are relatively few to use: For example FaceTime calls, Lehtikioski, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which came as a forced upgrade to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple's smart watch owners.
Cook says that removing Apple's software is more complicated than it looks.
Some applications are linked to someone else on the iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone," Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple iPhone apps work closely with other programs.
There are other programmes that do not work this way.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
So, according to Cook, Apple is looking into it because the company doesn't want to waste memory space on users' iPhone phones.
Inflation in the euro area fell to 0.1 per cent in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only marginally in August, or by 0.1% from one year ago, as reported by Eurostat, the EU statistical authority.
The rise in prices was driven down by lower energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised its estimate of 0.2% from a couple of weeks ago slightly downwards.
In July, inflation was 0.2 per cent.
So-called underlying inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's estimate of underlying inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2% cheaper last month than one year ago.
The average inflation rate in the EU of 28 countries was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
Consumer prices in Malta rose most in August, or 1.4 per cent, from the euro countries.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest at 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent minus the mark according to the EU's harmonised price index.
Inflation in the euro area remains persistently far away from the European Central Bank's (ECB) target of 2% increase in prices over the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
Next year the rise will pick up to 1.1%, the central bank anticipates in its new inflation forecasts announced at the beginning of September.
The US Fed is now trying to tighten monetary policy
The next recession in the United States will begin in less than a year's time, but more assuredly within three years after the country's Central Bank, Fed, takes up interest rates again for a long time.
And in the financial markets, the decline begins before the next recession.
FedEx has hinted that it might start raising interest rates this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession can hit us at its fastest by next autumn and as a financial market rate squeeze before then.
Or at least this is what will happen if the world's largest economy and financial markets function as they used to do - and if they react to the blackmail of Fed's money taps as they have done in the past.
These conclusions have been drawn by the German bank Deutsche Bank's London Market Survey strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The Bank distributed a more than 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to its international major customers last week.
The strategists who drew up the study and report do not pretend to know exactly when FedEx will start to raise interest rates or what will happen in the economy and in the market afterwards.
Instead, they present, through the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics, how the economy and the market have behaved in the past at and after Fed's interest rates.
In addition to historical observations, they will examine which key variables in the economy and financial markets are now on the same or different model as in previous interest rates - and what may result from it.
It becomes clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now more flimsy to bear the rise in interest rates than ever before in the 1950s.
♪ Not even a year before the recession started ♪
The leaders who decided on Fedi's monetary policy and its current stance have hinted throughout last summer and early autumn that the time is beginning to be ripe for raising interest rates.
The first increase in interest rates for more than nine years may already occur this week.
The matter will be resolved during Wednesday and Thursday when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Board of Directors of Fedi meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
Last time, FedEx raised its so-called ‘Fed funds' steering rate in June 2006.
That was the end of a series of relatively regular but small interest rates of 0.25 percentage points for exactly two years, with FedEx increasing its interest rates from 1.25% to 5.25%.
The symptoms of the financial markets began in 2007 with the difficulties of the US's most risky housing financing, and one year later the financial crisis ruptured into a global doomsday nightmare.
A major recession occurred in 2009.
Last time, severe adverse events in financial markets and the real economy started at a slower pace than has typically occurred since the previous Fed interest rates.
Similarly, the trials were tougher and harsher than ever since the depression of the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategies have screened the rise and fall of the world's largest economies and the turn of financial markets since 1950 and in some places since the beginning of the 19th century.
Fedi's interest rates and their economic and financial impact will be reported by them from the 1950s onwards.
It has taken less than a year, mostly less than three years, and on average less than three and a half years, at the fastest time since the first rate increase.
The increase in the exchange rate on the financial markets has ended within two years of the start of Fedi's interest rates.
In turn, FedEx has increased its steering rate and, in turn, reduced its steering rate since the early 1950s by a dozen cycles of different lengths.
Each time there have been differences between others, and there are relatively few times in the review, so it is unlikely that there will be any certainty as to the effects of the subsequent interest rates.
The strategies remind us that this time many things are different.
And not just better.
Interests too low for too long
The decisive causes of the financial crisis, let alone those responsible, may not be established beyond doubt even by decades of research.
But there are three things that have led to the crisis and which have contributed to its destructive power, and I think it is quite clear:
1) In the 21st century, Fed, the euro area ECB and the other largest central banks in the world considered their key interest rates too low for too long.
They patched up the tech bubble tracks, and they grew the next one at the same time.
2) Over the decades, the accumulated and already excessive amount of debt in the various parts of the financial and real economy grew even greater as a result of the excessive monetary policy of central banks.
The largest debt bubble in economic history until then was created.
3) In particular, crazy debt financing, which was almost unbridled in the financial economy, swelled the biggest exchange rate bubbles in the history of financial markets from shares to real estate, debt securities and commodities.
Even so, there is hardly much controversy that the financial markets that have risen to a height on increasingly complex debt lines were in a particularly dangerous and unstable state of affairs, as Fed and the other central banks last pushed interest rates up.
The financial structures on debt lines, let alone the valuation bubbles, did not last until after the rate increases had started and the cost of debt financing had turned up.
The risks were realised in the financial crisis and followed by a major recession.
A bigger bubble and more debt
Deutsche's strategists do not guess what will happen next, but give rise to a shock by mentioning, for example:
1) Fed and other large central banks have now considered their monetary policy stance to be even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower.
2) For a long time, debt has not been crazier than it was ten years ago, but now debt money is literally cheaper than free money.
Thus, the debt burden in the financial and real economy has not been reduced, but now, in various parts of the economy, a much heavier debt burden than before or never before in the financial crisis.
3) Liquidity from the central banks, which is more frequent and cheaper than before, has largely remained on the financial markets and has reached the highest level of the main securities and assets, whether at the peak or ever before the financial crisis.
And not only with financial market warnings, they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and from the worst recession in decades.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is unusually weak, but correspondingly, the pressures and risks of the financial markets are comparatively higher than before the financial crisis when FedEx next starts to tighten its financial stakes.
Maybe the future of Albert Edwards, the future of the French bank Societe Generale strategist, isn't as strange as it suddenly seems.
He has been preparing the Bank's international investors for Fedi's next round-off:
First, Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst, and soon it's time for Fedin to run off with even bigger QE money syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a manufacturer of computers and printers, intends to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the deductions are for HP's business services," says the company.
HP is divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which focuses on business sales, and HP Inc., which focuses on Pc machines and printers for consumers.
HP had the highest number of personnel in 2011 when it had 350000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302,000.
The company records non-recurring expenses of USD 2.7 billion (about EUR 2.4 billion).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be reduced to 25000-30000 employees.
Reductions on the consumer side will remain at 3,300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its activities to low-cost countries with 60% of its employees in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers is responsible for more than 10% of its operating result.
In the year before last, its three main customers imported 65 per cent of the operating result.
iOS 9 how to get a new operating system for iPhone after Apple update release
You can ask for a new operating system by going to the Settings app, by clicking "General" and then select "Software Update".
If the update is ready, the phone gives an option to download and then install it.
Some people have had problems since this installation when a "Software Update Failed" error message has appeared on the screen.
To overcome this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst congestion to pass or try to update via iTunes.
The phone guides the user in the final process.
This may include removing applications to get space, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the update and also facilitating the process with a new tool that proposes the applications to be removed and then reinstalls them when the update is completed.
You should make sure the phone is loaded or close to the charger during the upgrade, that the battery does not run out.
If the charge level is too low, Apple will not allow the upgrade to proceed, as if the battery runs out, it may result in the upgrade being broken.

Yle: Minister Berner has served on the board of the tax haven company
Ms Anne Berner, Minister for Transport and Communications (Kesk.) has been a member of the Board of Directors of the tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company's activities involve so-called tax planning.
It is a Luxembourg-based company called Salti II LuxCo, whose Board of Directors Berner was appointed in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Business Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Board.
Berner himself says he filed a resignation notice in May of this year.
I checked it out, and that's enough for me to file a notice of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration chains take place within the agreed timeframe," Berner says in Yle's interview.
Membership after merger
The ownership of the Swedish company Kährs is managed through the Luxembourg company.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner was a board member of Karelia-Upoflor from 2010 to 2013 and, following the merger, was a board member of Kährs and a Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, the holdings of Kährs are carried out in Luxembourg through a multi-stage ownership structure.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted board membership at the request of Kährs' second largest owner in Luxembourg.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been on the board of Karelia-Upoflor owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was looking for a partner that was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a venture capital investor who has a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that it was my job to ensure that the benefits of the capital of the Finnish family company were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the income from our Finnish companies' capital is taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context," Berner says.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's ownership of the company does not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure of the tax haven is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs' private equity fund Triton already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for its ownership.
Espoo opens a reception centre maintained by the company
Espoon Otaniemi opens the first reception centre maintained by the company for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants already today, starting at 6 p.m.
The number of seats may increase within one week to a maximum of 300-400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre in the real estate of the former Rescue College.
The operations are maintained by Luona Oy, which is particularly active in the production of healthcare and medical services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy jointly agree on security arrangements for the Centre.
STK is preparing an alternative blackmail package for working life
GTK will start preparing an alternative package for the blackmail of the government's working life.
The organisation also wishes to include other employee centre organisations.
According to President Antti Palola, attention is currently being paid to Friday's demonstration.
Alternative ways of reducing the cost of work are then returned.
Everyone understands that life goes on after Friday," Palola pointed out to journalists during the break of the organization's administration meeting.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) is not prepared for discussion.
STK economists have calculated that the security of change provided by the Government's Competitiveness Package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, compared to EUR 2,700 million on the other side of the package.
I don't know if there's a lot of enthusiasm on the part of the party to have a conversation if you're getting one to 100.
Palola: The negotiation link has been constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Kesk.) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, as the government will then issue a communication on its own package to the Parliament and start preparing reforms.
Palola did not comment on whether the timetable was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a dialogue with the government and it has been constructive all along.
According to Palola, surgery on Sunday supplements is a painful place for staff central organisation STTTK.
The organisation requires the government to withdraw from the mandatory legislation by which it is carrying out part of the blackmail.
According to Palola, the TTK does not want the alternative package to be prepared with the SDP.
Employees meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the Finnish Government's blackmail package presented last week.
As part of the package, for example, the wages of the first days of illness are cut, overtime payments are cut by half, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75 per cent and holidays are reduced.
It is stressed from the STK that the central organisations have invited employees to a demonstration and the intention was not to organise a strike.
Akavan Fjäder thanks
Mr Sture Fjäder, President of Akava, congratulates the STEK on preparing an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now in line with Akava, as Akava has been developing an alternative model for government performances for a longer time.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without SAK the package will not be comprehensive enough.
Mr Sture Fjäder, President of Akava, hopes that the SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will join us in preparing the proposal as an alternative to the cuts.
Antti Palola's STK told us earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, Alava announced that it has been preparing its own proposal for a five per cent competitive jump as an alternative to cuts.
The Akava has been ready to negotiate all along, and we have long been writing an alternative model for government performances.
We are prepared to look at the terms of employment as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks," says Chairman Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to Akava's line, as GTK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model for the government and employers of the country," says Fjäder.
The Akava Bureau will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to take a decision on the possible content of the agreement.
"The same boat, the common coal, the juvies" - playing bingo while Sipilä talks at night
Tampere University Green Left
Viva bingo coupon for the Green Left for the evening at the University of Tampere.
The prime ministers have previously given exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on Yle's channels on Wednesday night at 9:05 p.m.
A similar speech by the Prime Minister must go to 1932 when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister when he gave the famous radio speech, which marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
After that, the President and Ministers gave several radio talks during the winter and the further war.
In the 1990s Esko Aho gave a New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the strike of train performers with a television speech.
Single phone call, monarchy.
Sipilä's speech has been a source of criticism and speculation all day long about what is to come.
Paavo Arhinmäki, Chairman of the Left Alliance, said on Twitter that "Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a Prime Minister's announcement, so that the speech could also be discussed".
According to Green Ville Niinistö, "one call has already been seen.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
The SDP's Erkki Tuomija condemned on Facebook that "monarchist action: the Prime Minister will tell the people what is best for it".
Antti Rinne, Chairman of the SDP, challenged Sipilä's dialogue: "Soon six months after the elections.
Not a single appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's been tried.
What are you afraid of?
Public service
According to the Government Office, Sipilä's speech is recorded in advance and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it was commented on live by Lauri Lyly, President of SAK, and Jyri Häkämies, CEO of EK.
There have been criticisms of Sipilä's speech.
We considered the matter and stated that it was part of the public service mission to promote comprehensive publicity throughout Finland, a line in the news of Yle's publications Director Ismo Silvo Yle.
♪ Like We were in Tammelas ♪
The speech has also sparked ridicule.
When the evening comes, the dinner will be enjoyed well in advance, the children will be combed and dressed for their best.
My mom puts on a prettier jacket and my dad puts a tie around his neck.
At nine o'clock, the television will be silenced as it was in the days of the old Me Tammelas," writes the blogger Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä also say in his speech why there are millionaires in the Finnish government who hide their capital in tax havens, who draw up pardon laws for their fellow tax collectors and at the same time claim to the people that it is necessary to cut when the state is running out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
On what Sipilä says, one guess is made by the Green Left Viva of the University of Tampere.
It has published the bingo on Facebook.
Will we be hearing about the same boat, the common coal, the debt and team spirit tonight?
The coupons and pens are ready, at 9:05 it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Arena.
Ahtisaari Guardian: The Western countries rejected Russia's proposal to replace al-Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected Russia's offer to get Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to give up power, says to President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the UN proposed a plan that would, after some time, have given up power in style.
However, the Western countries did not take up the proposal because they believed that al-Assad would fall anyway within a few weeks.
In 2012, Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed three points in the bilateral debate: the opposition was not to be armed, the opposition had to be contacted immediately and the resignation of al-Assad had to be carried out in a subdued manner.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on all things, but we are able to discuss them openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said, "Sit down, Martti, and I'll tell you what we have to do," Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
There's no comment from diplomats.
Ahtisaari reports that he has transmitted Tshurkin's message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion to the magazine, but according to Ahtisaari there are no two words about it.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's arguments, but said that al-Assad's forces had already committed several massacres at that time and the main opposition groups refused any agreements that would have left him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former director of the Middle East Department of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is hesitant about the speeches of Ahtisaari, because, according to his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari's claim is that Tshurkin spoke with Moscow's mandate.
If he had told me about what Tshurkin said, I would have answered that I wanted to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
Jenkins said that even if he did, he would have suspected that it was Putin's trick to keep power on some al-Assad supporter.
The River of Refugees — Our Own Works
During the negotiations on Ahtisaari, some 7 500 people had died during the Syrian crisis.
According to UN estimates, the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have had to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own doing.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we ourselves caused," Ahtisaari says to the magazine.
Centre for the Organisation of Asylum Applicants to impose on Tornio
The organisation centre for asylum seekers designed by the Government in Northern Finland is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in the empty building of the Tornio joint operation in the city center.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable place to better control the influx of refugees from the Swedish border.
On Tuesday, Helsingin Sanomat announced that the Board of Governors would have already decided to present the school building as a space solution to the Ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppinen (left) of the Tornio City Council, this is not true.
When the whole council was not together and some of the group wanted a formal decision, we decided to invite the council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he will specify to the STT.
There were 36 delegates from 43 present at the meeting.
13 delegates opposed the Organization Centre.
Based on this, you could expect a positive decision," Hyöppinen says.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday and the response was rapid.
An estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time could be accommodated in the joint declaration.
The expert has visited to check that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a few hundred meters from the border, so it would also work in that sense," says Nousiainen.
Sipilä still wants an alternative to blackmail from the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Kesk.), half of the holiday money in the public domain would only cover part of the government's efforts to reduce the cost of work.
However, the government will be happy to accept an alternative package if the social partners manage to agree on such a package.
Mr Sipilä told journalists in Parliament that he had not been in contact with the social partners.
He also did not know how seriously organisations were looking for compensatory measures for the blackmail of working life announced by the government.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä's view, the halving of the locusts would be a tool, since it would affect almost all employees, unlike, for example, the government's planned cut in Sunday supplements.
Labour market organisations could agree on a cut in holiday money because they have been written down in collective agreements rather than in law.
The government will be reporting to the Parliament next Wednesday on the blackmail of working life in the form of a government communication.
According to Sipilä, the proposals from the organisations should be known before this.
This is not the final deadline either.
The legislative work will then start, i.e. the train will be on the move and it will become increasingly difficult.
There's plenty of time.
It won't take long for things like this to happen if there's a will, Sipilä formulated it.
The list published by the government last week includes, among other things, the conversion of Loppipainen and Helatorsta into unpaid holidays without shortening annual working hours.
In addition, the wages for the first days of sickness are cut, overtime payments are reduced by half, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
Reforms are carried out as mandatory legislation past the trade unions, which has given rise to strong criticism.
As a result of these activities, the wage-paying central organisations will organise a major demonstration on Friday, and several trade unions have announced political strikes.
The council of Tohmajärvi approved the expansion of the Mahlahall warehouse
The council of Tohmajärvi unanimously approved the extension of the warehouse of Nordic Koivu Oy, or Mahlahall.
The criticism was that the project was bigger and more expensive than was originally said.
Also a busy schedule with heartburn.
It was also a little surprised that the need for space was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of the warehouse at 400-450 m2 was approved for the investment programme, but the money will be decided later in the context of the interim report.
There was still talk of an investment of between EUR 150 000 and EUR 200 000 on the agenda, but at the meeting, Technical Director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be approximately EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it brings work and tax revenue to the locality.
There is no risk for the municipality, as the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) explained.
There is room for Karelian language in Joensuu
The City Council eased its previous sharp stance to bring street name signs in Karelian to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct in terms of preserving Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of Karelian language because there are no historical grounds for it and Karelian language is not a natural part of the region's identity.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more part of the eastern Savonian dialects.
Even after a new decision, there will be no Karelian street name signs in the city center.
However, the City of Joensuu is ready to use the Karelian language on a case-by-case basis, for example in information boards and tourism marketing.
The city recommends the same approach to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a one-language municipality, it is also worth a broad-minded approach to the use of Karelian language now that multiculturalism lives and changes strongly in North Karelia.
Karelian language is still a peculiarity of the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the whole of Finland's forest capital.
Both can well be used in the wide range of marketing in the province.
The closure of train connections will cut the vitality of the province
Train cuts hit the vitality of the province with a hard hand.
Transport links directly affect the region's business life and competitiveness.
And that makes it possible to live and work here at all, says Kari Karjalainen, Mayor of Joensuu.
He also points out the issue of air transport, which has also been followed on several occasions in the report.
It is important for the whole province that we do not have the opportunity to reduce our chances of doing so by state intervention, as is now happening.
We should look at the impact of these closures on employment, for example, Karjalainen stresses.
The deterioration of accessibility poses a further challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees," says Jukka Mönkkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor access also affects the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot due to research.
Marko Junkrinen, Head of Recruitment, says that marketing the university towards Western Finland is already difficult because the connections are weak in a transverse direction.
Currently, about half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
Of them, about 10-20 percent are from New Zealand, which is partly explained by a direct train connection.
Joensuu became one gravel voice for Siu's sotelle
The Joensuu City Council's view of the Siun sote project is apparently unanimous, but one of the gravel voices is also present.
At the Board of Directors' meeting on Monday, Mr Pentti Keskisalo (sd., in the picture) presented a departure from the project, but his presentation was unsound.
The Board approved the draft decision by Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be revised at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will deliver the final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train from Eagle to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger train traffic from Kotka to Kouvola will remain in the future, albeit fewer than one train crew.
There will be changes in passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One pair of trains is left out, but still five times a day you can get from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The contractions are due to state austerity measures.
The purchase money of the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four-year period will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quieter routes will be completely stopped.
VR will establish new timetables by the end of the year.
They will enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed up to the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys got out.
The rescue department let a 12-year-old who climbed the roof out of a jam, who couldn't get off the roof on his own.
The situation arose in Tornionmäki, Ketotie, around 5:30 on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladder to the roof.
It did not prevent a group of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mast of radio amateurs next to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same way, but one didn't.
As a result, the others fled the scene and passersby called on the rescue service to help the last one safely left on the roof with a betlift back to the surface.
FedEx's operating profit is two-fold, decreasing the outlook for the tax year 2016
FedEx reported depressing results in the last quarter, and the delivery giant cut its performance forecasts for the whole year, as a result of the weakened demand for freight services and the higher costs of its land services.
The company also said that it intends to hire around 55 000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that it was hiring 50 000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
Its share decreased by about 2.5 per cent in the opening auction 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening clock.
FedEx Corp. says that next May it expects the tax year to end with $10.40 to $10.90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts waited for $10.84, reported in a FactSet survey.
The smaller outlook came in spite of an average price increase of 4.9%, which will take effect on 4 January, and despite the higher additional charges that started in November for heavy or large parcels on land.
The company said that it expects the operating profit to increase from the previous year because they have cut costs, turnover has increased and the online store is growing.
The president and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "will be able to make a steady contribution, taking into account weaker economic conditions than expected, especially in production and global trade."
The plans for pay during the holiday were announced the day after the competitor UPS announced that he would hire between 90 and 95 000 extra workers, about the same amount as it did last year.
In the quarter ending 31 August, FedEx's profit was $692 million, which is 6 per cent more than last year.
The profit per share came to $2.42, which falls from a $2.44 average estimate. The survey by 12 analysts was conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Net sales rose by 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
In Zack's poll, six analysts were expecting $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a reduction in international priority transport which has halted the development of its Express unit's turnover.
However, the increase in e-commerce has improved FedEx Ground's results.
In the last quarter, the turnover of the land unit increased by 29 per cent, but the revenue from the operations was basically the same due to the high costs of larger packages and insurance.
The revenues of the Express unit were better due to higher basic charges, while operating profit in freight operations decreased by higher labour costs.
At the opening auction, approximately one hour before the opening bell, FedEx's shares fell by $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
On Tuesday, FedEx closed the 11 percent decline for this year and 17 percent below the 11th of June record.
This week, the governors of the Federal Reserve will sit around a huge mahogany table for two days at a long-awaited meeting to decide whether the time has come to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
At the other end of the central bank's decorative, two - story conference room is muraled from the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, and his colleagues, must put the nation's financial interests above anything else.
Congress has placed two kinds of responsibility on the central bank: they must maximise employment in the United States and keep prices stable.
After the Great Depression, however, the central bank's leaders have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: economic stability.
It is precisely this third requirement that can be a decisive factor in the decision to be published on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted, and the decision whether the US economy is ready to be weaned by a record incentive that has been brought up to the end of 2008 by a short-term interest rate that has remained almost zero .
Although the majority of the data show a steady economic growth, the recent turmoil in global financial markets may have made the central bank officials, who are already on guard in advance, even more startled as regards the increase in volatility.
"I understand that the labour market and inflation are the first and most important elements to be monitored," says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economic expert at the broker shop Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if they are looking for a justification for leaving interest rates unchanged, increased uncertainty on the world market is a valid enough basis for waiting," he says.
There has been no agreement on the Central Bank's decision, which is also a source of nervousness in the economy.
According to a recent study by Bloomberg, about half of the financial experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
The financial markets, on the other hand, expect the Central Bank to delay the withdrawal, as the key indicator indicates that the potential for growth is only around 30%.
This refers to a decline in the securities market if the central bank raises the level if the decision-makers did not succeed in softening the attack by promising that the next withdrawal would not take place in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index rose by 228.89 points, i.e. 1.4 per cent, with a new figure of 16 599.85.
The recovery was accompanied by the expectation that the central bank will keep the level unchanged this week," says John Lonski, Chief Economics Specialist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It's surprising if the Central Bank raises interest rates right now," he says.
If the decision-makers raise interest rates, "they must make a lot of effort in their policy to support the financial markets so that they do not panic."
Other experts argue that an increased level would reassure the financial markets as it would remove uncertainty as to when the central bank will operate.
Just a month ago, it seemed that the Central Bank would be raising interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point this month, taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of the monetary situation, which would ensure the stability of the recovery in the United States.
Yellen has said in spring and early summer that he expects the level to rise this year, despite the fact that the liberals are demanding more economic development in their complaints.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, which is the lowest figure for seven years and close to the level considered by the Central Bank as the limit for full employment.
The increase in wages has shown signs of pick-up.
Although inflation is still below the central bank's 2% annual target, the central bank's decision-makers claim that the main reason for this is the temporary effect of the price of oil that has fallen significantly.
The economy 'even at higher interest rates and also needs them in view of the tight situation on the labour market', says Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics's Chief Economics Specialist.
However, the financial markets around the world were shaken last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell by up to 16 per cent from its record in May, as investors feared China would slow down global growth as well.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now close to 10% below the peak in May.
For central bank decision-makers, market turmoil is an additional factor in a complex equation, which indicates when interest rates should be raised.
"Without these events in the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy in recent weeks, decision-makers would step up the level at this meeting," says Stephen D. Oliner, a specialist researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former central bank official.
Now he predicts that the decision-makers will wait at least a month to get a better understanding of the impact.
"The potential impact on the US economy is still very unclear and they do not have much information at their disposal as regards the consequences of the events in China," Oliner says.
The well-being of the international economy is not the central concern of the Central Bank, so in principle it should not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Central Bank has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the Central Bank has been enormous.
In 2013, Ben S. Bernanken, then president, suggested that the Central Bank could "reduce" the amount of money, caused upheavals in the market around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, central bank officials are expected not only to follow developments elsewhere but also to consult other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The central bank's decision-making process is "more art than science", says Zachary Karabell, head of Envestnet Inc.'s global strategy.
Jeffrey Lecker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, pointed out this month that "the central bank has previously overreacted to the movement of the financial markets which seemed to be separate from the fundamentals of the economy."
The Federal Open Market Committee has called for an increase in interest rates and Mr Lecker, a member entitled to vote, calls for an example of the 1998-99 decisions.
The Asian economic crisis caused the Central Bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 percentage points during the three meetings "without worrying about its limited, identifiable impact on US economic growth", Lecker says.
A year later, the Central Bank overturned these cuts.
The central bank should give priority to financial stability only during a major crisis, as the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England's interest fixing committee.
The latest turmoil does not come anywhere near its level," Posen says.
"No one wants to be in a situation where interest rate increases are feared because the market is upset," says Mr Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a dual requirement and does not mention financial stability; as long as that is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

The Brazilian Pediatric Association in Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet for breast-feeding women
The Brazilian Pediatric Association (SPRS) has found a shocking way to try to make women understand the importance of good nutrition during breast - feeding by publishing pictures of babies sucking breasts that have been painted with descriptions of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which provide babies with all the nutrients needed to develop a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that increasing calories is not the only change in diet that mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by the Texas Baylor College of Medicine Professor Robert Waterland revealed that the healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genetic expression of their babies and protects babies from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the child's immune system.
The Seven Channel Sunrise program is a favorite in ratings, despite the Nine Channel's efforts to announce the leadership exposure in Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's rush to Canberra to announce the posthumous announcement of the leader of the Liberal Party failed to increase today's ratings.
The Nine Channel morning program was sent from the capital of the country after Malcolm Turnbull took over Tony Abbott.
The competing program Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Army, was stuck in London as part of that week's series of international broadcasts including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The weight of the distance did not seem to interfere with Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise's average audience in five state capitals was 397,000, compared with 339 000 on Today.
Today's average rose slightly compared to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but was still lower than last Thursday (343,000).
Today's been catching Sunrise for the past few months.
In August, the average was 318,000 for Today and 330 000 for Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varied between 40 000 and 50 000 viewers.
Up until September, Sunrise's average is 349 000 viewers, compared with 314 000 on Today.
This is the most interesting event this morning.
The winds of change are blowing this morning, not only in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!
Published by TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
The great news of the Seven channel was the amazing first performance of the 800-word series, where the former star of the Packed to the Rafters series, Erik Thomson, appeared.
The new drama series, which collected a fairly impressive average of 1.219 million viewers, tells of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the New Zealand coast with his two children.
Critics have wondered if Thomson was the driving force of the popular series alone without Rafters star Rebecca Gibson.
Last night's results gave this real certainty.
Seven's The X Factor program was a strong favourite with 1,136 million viewers, easily winning The Block series (838 000) and the TBL Families series (726 000).
Seven had a double fate on the second night of The Chase Australia series.
The first half-hour (17-17.30) of Andrew O'Keefe's new quiz show gathered the average 446 000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17.30-18) rose to 623 000 viewers - which was enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuiren's Hot Seat program (613 000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia's first half-hour audience averaged 520,000 admissions, and the second half-hour was a staggering 720 000.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
The fall in the average number of viewers in The Chase Australia's second night gives Nine the confidence that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular programme at 5.30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minutes program, which failed to reduce McGuire's ratings.

The final trio agrees with Daddy that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
The secret has been revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally revealed who was winning The Bachelor series.
The identity of that woman has been kept extremely secret, with which Sam Wood ends up in The Bachelor.
Three girls left are definitely not slipping who got the last rose.
However, when we talked with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before the three became two, they could, however, inadvertently give a clue about the identity of the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's finals.
All three women became poetic in telling how Wood is a perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, ambition, family value and positiveness as reasons why they would want to be his partner.
However, when they were asked, "If Wood's last rose is not for you, to whom should it go?", their answers may have given a revelation as to who won the bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly mentioned Mackay as the best option for Wood after them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been uncomplicated since day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house, the energy of Sarah and Sam's energy seemed quite compatible, and that thought was in my mind throughout the series," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is very earthy, it's fun to be around her," Markoski added.
I've seen them together and there's chemistry between them.
They seem to be having a good time and relaxing together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a great match.
Mackay said that last week's house visits made him realize that Wood could be "the one."
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game - I am now wholeheartedly involved in this," he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say," he said.
I like the remaining girls just as much, so it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be sent on Wednesday at 7.30 p.m. on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne has many options for starting his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle were both quite interested in moving to the United States, and many other teams have been asking about him since his impressive day of open practice at the end of last year.
However, Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game after this Australian rugby league convert dropped the ball in his first flight kickback when the team won on Tuesday in Minnesota at 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and let Hayne return the next flight kick and brought him into the race game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula's true character was also seen in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of calling his new recruits a battalion in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at the post-game press conference.
The 49ers specialist Cam Inman reported that Haynea was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped the fly kick that Minnesota Vikings caught in the first quarter of the game.
This really wasn't the start that Hayne and her numerous Australian fans wanted for the man's NFL debut.
Hayne was seen cursing on the way from the airport after the drop and later told the Australian radio pair team Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM channel at 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start for his NFL career.
"It was just one of these things, you just have to think about the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared her leaven to her 2007 Origin debut when the pitch in her own goal area led to Queensland's goal.
All in all, it was still a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed in a photo published on her Instagram account with fans holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested with a gun on a Siberian runway.
Hodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his efforts to support democracy were restricted.
4 died as a police officer fired rubber bullets against protestors in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, died in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into a mob that protested against the country's new draft Constitution, the official reported on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh region about 175 miles west of Kathandus capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the chief official in the area, said that over 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, and some of them threw stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before using rubber bullets.
Twenty cops and five civilians were injured, he told me.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, known to have killed but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, seemed to have caused so many deaths.
The conflict was the latest in weeks of violent demonstrations across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of the ethnic group called Madhesi say that the new provinces established under the proposed new constitution undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in Western Nepal when the Tharus Group demands its own state.
Since 10 August, at least 40 people have died in violent clashes, 11 of which have been police officers.
At that time, four main parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - this is a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has had a central government for centuries.
The new Constitution has been planned since 2008, but the legislators speeded up the process since the devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
This week the legislators have voted on the draft Constitutional clauses in Kathmandu, and the authorities have said that the new Charter could be adopted by Sunday.
U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) says that south of Cape Verde has a 60% chance of a hurricane
On the broad low - pressure front, which is about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde island group, there is a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical hurricane in the next 48 hours, reported the National Hurricane Center of the United States on Tuesday.
On the second precise low - pressure front, which is halfway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles, there is also a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical hurricane over the next two days, the weather forecast center in Miami added.
Google starts a donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GooGL.O) published a donation campaign aimed at raising $11 million for humanitarian organisations that help thousands of refugees from Europe as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal perspective when it published a donation campaign on its blog.
Instead of being reported by the director, Google's employee Rita Masoud, who, at the age of seven, fled Kabul with her family, wrote about her own personal experience.
"Our journey involved numerous dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, coldness and darkness," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family are desperate to help.
Donations are awarded to four non-profit organisations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors without frontiers, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google explained that it will match every donation made worldwide on google.com/refugeerelief to $5.5 million, with an overall target of $11 million.
Europe is experiencing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, mainly due to the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people out of their homes this year.
Many also flee from war - torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Loss of weight may help mildly obese diabetics
According to a new study, the benefits of weight reduction surgery in mildly obese type 2 diabetic patients may last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics live longer after a weight reduction surgery than those treated in other ways than surgery.
"It takes a long time to get the data," Dr. Robin Blackstone says. She is a weight reduction specialist who wrote an editorial for a new study in JAMA Surgery.
Different methods of reducing the size of the stomach are used for weight loss or bariatric surgery.
They reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the majority of subjects in the study have been pathologically obese and have had a BMI of 35 or more.
BMI, or weight ratio to length, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If BMI is over 25, it indicates that someone is overweight and if BMI is over 30, they are considered obese.
You can count your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the purpose of this new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery, and stomach reduction, to medicinal treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of cut persons fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, BMI remained roughly the same in 29 persons who were treated with non-operative methods.
Of the people cut, 36% had total and 28% had partial improvement in diabetes.
By comparison, the overall improvement in diabetes was only 1% in the treatment group and 2% in the treatment group.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and the "bad" LDL column "were generally better in the surgery group", the authors noted.
Researchers also monitored patients' blood haemoglobin levels (A1c), which reflect long-term blood glucose levels.
Haemoglobin A1c should remain below 7%, researchers write.
Post-operative haemoglobin levels of A1c dropped from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the treatment group it remained stable at approximately 8%.
However, this better "glycemic control", as described by the improved haemoglobin levels of A1c, did not reduce mortality over five years, says chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The study group also compared the mean results between two different types of surgery.
At the fifth year, when compared with the gastric surgery group, the gastric bypass surgery group had lost more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), decreased more than its body mass index (7.4 and 5.1), decreased more than its A1c levels (3.1% and 2.1%) and had been more likely to achieve complete diabetes remission (46.9 and 16.7%).
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix Blackstone says that although the study does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden, where the operation led to longer lives for heavier people.
A Swedish study found that obese people undergoing weight reduction surgery had a 29 percent lower risk of dying over a period of 15 years when compared to a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not show an improvement in the survival of surgical patients, Blackstone says that the results are encouraging for people with BMI less than 35 and interested in surgery.
"The results of the study are crucial precisely in that they show that surgery is safe for the lower body mass index group," he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously at a time when the patient's BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that once a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation.
"Not everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibet's Buddhism has called for an end to the violence in the refugees' home countries.
Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in her speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion Centre in Oxford at the beginning of her ten-day visit to Britain, dedicated to ethical research.
Dalai Lama claimed that in the current situation the needs of all mankind should be put ahead of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that while the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is also inadequate.
"Not everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria in the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of many thousands of refugees, but in the meantime we have to think about long-term solutions: how can we bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The ultimate thing is to think about how we can reduce the number of killings in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In taking a stand on the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following the 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the violent response from the United States caused violent events in the chain.
"After 9/11-Isku I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem was through non-violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and it created unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Over the last four years, the swallowing of a child's hand-disinfectant has increased fourfold.
Poisoning Focal Points across the United States have reported an increase of almost 400% in the swallowing of high alcohol-containing handicrafting agents for children under 12 years of age since 2010, says Georgia Toxicity Data Centre.
According to Dr Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgian Toxicity Data Centre, the cases of swallowing disinfectants reported to the toxicology data centres for children under 12 years of age rose from 3266 cases in 2010 to 16117 cases in 2014.
"Children are more interested in these products and, unfortunately, a certain percentage of them go to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant on purpose, while others want to impress their friends or meet the challenge in social media.
There are videos on YouTube where teenagers drink disinfectant to get a cheap boom.
According to reports, teenagers have mixed disinfectant with alcoholic oral water to get a stronger drink.
Pleasant fragrances of disinfectant can attract younger children.
"The child doesn't think this is bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (hands) are those with added fragrances.
There are strawberry, grape and orange-scenting disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
The disinfectant in the hands may contain any alcohol between 45 % and 95 %.
Especially in young children, only a few sprays are needed for alcohol poisoning.
"It's really concentrated alcohol," Mr. Stephen Thornton told Fox 4 in Kansas City, the head of the Center for Toxicity at the University of Kansas Hospital.
So please don't leave the whiskey shot lying on the table, but leave the hand-disinfectant in the open, and if the children are interested in it, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six - year - old girl who recently swallowed only four sprayed strawberry - scented disinfectants at school and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
His blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice as high as the adult drunk driving limit, says first aid physician Chris Ritchey, who treated a girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah mossed when he spoke and couldn't walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors followed him overnight in a separate children's hospital in case of brain damage, as alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey explained.
"It was really scary," said Nhaijah's mother Ortoria Scott to CNN.
The situation could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or alcohol swabs and remove disinfectants from children's reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a hand disinfectant containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
Health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was reported as an active ingredient.
In January, in the north of New York State, three fourth graders planned to poison their "bad" teacher by spreading bacterial poison into the classroom, reports a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to the disinfectant of the hands and denied it in her class.
The police consider the plan to be a "drunk nonsense" and to leave disciplinary action to the school district.
Rumors: Celtic has no conflict
Griffiths downgrades talk about Celtic conflicts, and Deila admits that Hoops is in a tight spot, but he can turn it around.
The Hearts are fighting the Scottish Football Federation against Neilson's charges, and Warburton is on guard against the January recruitments that could disrupt the team's unity.
Dons increased his lead to Celtic to five points.
The first half of Adam Rooney's penalty kick led Aberdeen to a narrow victory over Hamilton at the Pittodri Stadium and allowed the team to increase the difference between Celtic and five points.
Griffiths is underestimating what he says about contradictions.
There have been rumours of internal conflicts within Celtic, but Griffiths immediately passed them, claiming that he and his teammates have no sense of working under closer scrutiny when the team is preparing to face the Dutch serial leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are waiting for us to meet.
The lack of a Scottish championship bores the Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers midfield player and the former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition for a championship with Rangers.
Ajax's current ambassador de Boer said, "There are no more highlights of Celtic games in Holland, and why?"
Because the Rangers aren't involved.
People here can't just talk about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about Old Firm teams.
They talk about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There are a lot of tension in the games of these teams, and also non-Scotlanders want to follow those games.
Deila swears she'll turn the situation around.
Ronny Delia has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has sworn to turn the situation around.
Loss to Malmö and the resulting fall from the Champions League quickly resulted in loss to Aberdeen, who played with ten men, who is now at the top of the series by a five-point difference to the next.
But she said, "Celtic's had bad episodes before, and we're getting up again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know that this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
So are we, but we have to keep going.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton on guard against January's player transfers
Although the Rangers boss Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on the possible targets of January's player transfers, he is on guard from the recruitment rampage to assure us that he does not want to confuse the team's consensus.
The former Brentford boss said, "The oak transition window is very different from the summer window."
For players coming in during the summer, there is an adjustment period throughout the period before, which is reflected in our team this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can do more harm.
Celtic's interest in Michu suggests retirement.
Swansea's attacker Michu, whose name is attached to Celtic in connection with the transfer window, has suggested that he may retire after his contract with Swans ends.
A 29-year-old player has had ankle problems for two years, and during the summer he was unable to find new company outside Wales.
The Hearts are ready to fight the Scottish Football Federation for Neilson's comments.
The Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team then lost 3-2. The defenseman's red card was later cancelled, and this was the third red card that Collum condemned, which was overturned in the last eight months.
Neilson stands by what he said, saying, "I didn't question honesty, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths swears he'll avoid Tynecastle.
The loyal Hibernian player was rebuked for admitting to singing an offensive song about the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in Roseburn, Edinburgh, before the Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was derby and it was an impulse," the attacker added, "it's safe to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I go play Celtic."
Tannadice's government believes in Dundee United's leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that Dundee United's government still has faith in the leadership team's ability to turn the situation around, but admits that the players' weakening has to stop.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're gonna get the boys back together," says Donnelly.
McInnes is happy with the "ugly victory" in Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately involved in the game against Hamilton Aces, but thanks to Adam Rooney's first half-time penalty kick, he managed to achieve his seventh consecutive league victory that raised them to the top of the table with five points above Celtic.
McInnes says: "There is no team that would have won anything, whether it's a trophy or a league that would not also have won games in this way."
Scotland's unemployment remains the same as the United Kingdom's total growth
EMPLOYMENT in Scotland remained at 164 000 people between May and July, while unemployment in the UK as a whole rose by 10 000 to 1.82 million.
The unemployment rate in Scotland is 5.9% higher than that in Great Britain at 5.5%, the figures from the National Statistical Institute (ONS) show.
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12 000 people over a three-month period and the number of employed persons is now 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74% in the quarter, which is higher than the UK average of 73.5%.
The Scottish State Secretary, David Mundell, commented on these latest figures: "The government's long-term plan is to build the foundations for a stronger economy."
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made the historic decision to remain a part of Britain.
Over these 12 months, the labour market in Scotland has improved, employment has increased and unemployment has fallen.
Why I'm witnessing an execution in Oklahoma
If there is no legal intervention at all, later today I will see the man executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'll be sitting in the viewers' gallery at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary watching Richard Glossip be executed with a lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
I received the request in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
I've begun to dread this day as it approaches.
So why did I say yes?
I said yes because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
Journalists have the opportunity to monitor executions in America, and since there are often more applications than there are available places, participants are selected through a terrible draw.
Oklahoma has reduced the seats reserved for the media from 12 to 5.
Whoever's chosen will look at the event cool.
I can't do it.
I will be sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have also created my own connection with him through the phone calls made over the months and through a two- and a half-hour visit.
I like him.
We laugh often when we talk.
Prison officials say that I cannot be both a witness and a journalist, so I cannot carry a notebook and a pen with me to save what I have seen.
All I have to do is try to remember all the details.
On Twitter, an oklahic journalist accused me of compromising my neutrality.
Here's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants you to, and you'll get to participate.
I complained to the reporter.
He admitted that "you could have set your words better," but he still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
He won't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do that if he said so.
I've told him he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants us to have an international journalist here who'll write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help the trend against the death penalty.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is right next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, you can listen to a series of podcasts I made.
I'm not going through all the details again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Tree's murder would, in any case, make him guilty of help.
But I think there's a very strong chance that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there wasn't enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think it's wrong to execute him.
And this is the point of view I think he's going to die from.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
There will be other journalists who will take care of it.
I give you a description of what it feels like to watch a man I like die unnecessarily.
He was lured out of the Canning River after a watery police hunt.
The officer of Canning Vale remained dry when he lured the man out of the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to distract the police from their tails went wrong when he found himself in a shallow, muddy water just three feet away from a police man who tried "to lure him back gently to the beach".
The police of Canning Vale were called to Beckenham on Tuesday for trespassing.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to distract them by heading for the Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
"He was standing in the water saying, 'I'm not coming out, come get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to get wet, so he used a safer tactic: "a proper police conference".
"Sometimes people do funny things trying to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Ben Cousins, the champion football player, is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing and tried to swim across the Swan River River.
He did not succeed in his company, but inspired the locals to start designing a playful Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that the suppliers tried to spy on him and threatened to stop competing.
Peter Moody has claimed that the officials of Racing Victoria tried to infiltrate his stables last year, threatening to stop competing immediately.
He blames the editors and Racing Victoria's integrity division for claiming that they have a personal campaign going on against him. On Wednesday, the late rejection of Lady Tatain due to the treatment on the day of the race was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for the competition and that he has been in a difficult situation since Lidar's unexplained positive cobalt sample.
He's been keeping his tongue in check on spy claims for a year and a half, and he didn't want it to look like envy.
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so frustrated that everything goes out at once," Moody said.
They knew the situation was going on.
Sometimes I just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk with my head up and I want the owners to think that I'm doing my best for them.
When they start thinking differently, I'm not supposed to be a coach anymore.
Then I'd have to consider what to do with my license.
Previously, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview on racing.com where he told me that the integrity department had been trying to spy on his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man... "and I named him "and offered him a job at my stables if he would pass on information about what I'm doing there.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, it's true they should fire their lawyers because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former President of Racing Victoria, David Moody, current Chairman of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Sundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I begin to think that this is becoming personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to man up and perhaps pass on responsibility to other than the coaches for what is happening in the industry?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I that harmful to the industry?
Maybe that's what people think.
Maybe they'll have to take my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying here might make them think about that.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, and it grieves me.
It really saddens me.
I pressure them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have my family's support, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach's frustration has grown with the long-term Lidar cobalt study, and the late rejection led him to conclude that he could "throw his license over the table".
Moody, best known for training the undefeated champion Black Caviar, has called the race day treatment rule "feelable" after a mud or clay bath has been placed on horse feet, which is irregular.
"It's against competition rules.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put mud on it.
It could have had a grave last night.
It could have had it yesterday, just like it was.
He had it on the day of the race.
Moody may face a three-month ban on competition due to the day's grave care, which was the subject of an investigation by the trustees.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about a horse.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Driver in custody in Cobram
The police have arrested a man who was responsible for a traffic escape after hitting a cyclist in Cobram this weekend.
The cyclist was transported by air to Royal Melbourne Hospital after serious injuries when the car hit him on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
The police told us that the driver drove away and did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported himself to the police in Shepparton.
He will be accused of not stopping in an accident, of failing to provide assistance and of other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in the hospital, and his condition is stable.
Craig Bellamy, coach of the Melbourne Storm team, attacks rivals on wrestling claims.
Melbourne Storm's coach Craig Bellamy has criticised the claims of two NRL rugby league champions that his team's tackles are part of the "line".
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm to "wrestle" on their own side when it suddenly won the final round in Sydney on Friday night.
The Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett could barely hide his reference to Storm after winning the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night's final screening. Bennett called the game "the display window" of the rugby league and said that the two Queensland teams were not "very excited" about wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's tackles and said they're just focusing on "contact" when they tackle.
Bellamy added that his confidence was enhanced by two leading coaches' criticisms of Storm, which means they're afraid they're going to lose to the team.
"This always comes up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we lost to them 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we have not changed anything in our defence systems or in our techniques throughout the year, and in the last six weeks we have just focused on contact in the tackles, and that has made us succeed.
Trent has been on the team for three years, and he obviously has a great team to coach, so he's probably not used to losing, and this was a little shock to him.
It's funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "an exciting rugby" by reminding his mentor that Bennett coached St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing "stupidly".
Wayne's talking about an exciting rugby.
He thought it was important to compare his Saturday night game with our Friday night game and tell us how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 how St George was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn't care less.
But now he has a team that can play the kind of rugby we find exciting, especially when he has fast young friends.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have players of that type.
He brought it up in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby - not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play like that.
I become more confident when they say such things because they are a little concerned about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as a match for important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and Roosters was more point-rich than that between Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was certainly a good game, I haven't looked at it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two more goals, but is it exciting rugby?
Or does it make breaking an exciting line of defense and not doing a goal?
For me, this is about policy.
If they mention us, it means that somewhere we can play against them.
Storm is free this weekend because they have already won the right to play home games with either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronu Sharks for next Saturday night's pre-final at AAMI Park. Tickets will be available next Tuesday morning.
For the Serb Man, $200,000 in bail on a drug charge.
A man threatened with a possible life sentence for a 40 kilos of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released for $200,000 in bail.
29-year-old Marko Maksimovic is one of five men who was arrested last month after the federal police had traced 100 kilos of drugs to the Solay yacht that came to South America through Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maximovic was seen meeting other defendants at the marina all morning and then met them at the Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilos of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Although Maximovic is threatened with a potential life sentence for attempted possession of cocaine for business purposes, his lawyer claimed that there was no evidence that Maximovic tried to hold the entire quantity and that he could have been in a café for totally innocent reasons.
Judge Peter Flanagan of the Supreme Court was concerned that Maximovic was trying to escape.
"He has close links with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal court case, Maksimovic lied to the police about where he lived.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather together had offered $200,000 in bail to secure his release.
"After reading the oaths of both parties, it is clear that setting a guarantee amount of $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
But it alone was not enough to prevent him from appearing in court, he warned.
The guarantee was granted to Maximovic on condition that he surrenders both his Australian and Serbian passports, reports to the police every day and maintains his curfew between 6 p.m. and 6 p.m.
Stevan Hogg used her phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures.
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for pictures of child abuse.
While the girl was sleeping, Stevan Hogg took this phone and then logged in to an online communications service where Hogg received numerous immoral pictures of children sent to her by another user.
She woke up later, discovered that the phone was missing and found it in Hogg's sleeping hand.
She searched her phone and found shocking messages, and then immediately told her mother.
When the police arrived, they saw five images, searched the computers on the scene, and found "stricken" web searches using search terms used to search for immoral images taken from children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this "to tempt paedophiles" on the Internet before he "proclaimed to be a police officer to scare them".
"He said that this is an addiction - that he is dependent on scaring people.
He admitted that he had done the searches on the computer but said that they were only done because he wanted to pretend to be a cop so he could scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with an unknown person who sent him the pictures and about Hogg's request for additional photos.
Hogg said he only did this for bait purposes.
He said that when he drinks, he's sick in the head, and he wants to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added: "When she found the pictures on her phone, she cried out to her mother, shaking and crying.
She saw the immoral pictures on the phone and then met the defendant.
She was interviewed and told that the accused had used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
The 23-year-old Hogg, who lives on Ward Road in Dundee, admitted his guilt for making or taking pictures of immoral children on 14 June last year, violated his bail on 25 January of this year and failed to appear before the Court on 24 March of this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim requested that Hogg not be entered in the register of sexual offenders, as it can be argued that his crime did not include "a significant sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the sentence until October so that the social services had time to prepare the background reports.
Hogg was given bail in this case, but in other ongoing cases, he'll be in custody before the hearing.
He was added to the sex offenders' register before the day of the conviction.
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe gave the wrong speech to Parliament
Earlier this year, the oldest African leader, Mugabe, fell on the stairs leading to the podium.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of the crash spread like a virus on social media.
The opening of this House was also marred by the arguments of the opposition legislators that anonymous death threats had been sent to them, warning them not to boo Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they booed him and interrupted him with intermediate screams while he was giving a speech to Parliament on the state of the country - which he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) group controller Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interfere with Mugabe's speech.
"The number from which the message was sent does not answer, but the message is entitled 'death'," Gonese told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
The message warned the Members concerned that immunity would end in this House, and when they stepped out, parliamentary immunity would not apply.
The supervisor of group discipline said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is "concerned" about threats against its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut between 25 000 and 30 000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in business services.
Later this year, HP will be divided into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer business from its faster-growing business equipment and service activities.
The expected job cuts bring with them costs of about $2.7 billion, starting from the fourth quarter, according to HP's release.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise", said Meg Whitman, President and CEO of HP, who will lead the unit after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than today's HP, and we will have a wide and deep range of services that will help companies move into a new business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual turnover will be over $50 billion, and it will "focus on producing unmatched integrated technology solutions" for companies," says the company's release.
Jako breaks up the company that Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, graduated from Stanford University University, set up in the 1930s to manufacture electrical supplies. The company operated in a garage in Palo Alto called "The Origin of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone a huge restructuring to cope with the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the world's second-largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the USA, and its distribution is the latest in a sector based on the belief that strictly limited companies are performing better.
Arsenal's Captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must support the injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb's tie.
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is now only September and assuming that his rehabilitation is going according to plan, there is no reason why he should not be playing again by Christmas.
Even in this best case, Wilshire will miss at least four of the next English games and, given his background, it is uncertain whether he will be participating in the European Championship next summer.
The biggest pity about this latest problem is that Wilsheren's end of last season was strong after a single ankle injury, and he remembered his old sharpness before the season began.
"This kind of injury does not threaten your career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also admitted, when a player tries to get back in the middle there is always a risk of additional injuries.
There is also an uncomfortable pattern in the formation.
Studies by Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilshere has had 23 different injuries since his debut six years ago.
In addition, during the last five seasons, he has played only 65 of Armenal's 157 league games.
Looking at Arsenal's wider picture since the 2007-08 season, in six of the eight seasons it has been one of the main league teams who has lost most days due to the injury.
Wenger admits the possibility of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that their last season's improvement in disability statistics will continue.
"Sometimes when you return from injury can be a vulnerable period when you need to strengthen your body and acquire competition," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope that his body will stabilize, I am sure that will happen, and that he will be able to make the career he deserves.
Wenger prepares to recycle his team when Arsenal starts his Champions League game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then playing against Chelsea on Saturday and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are probably in the process of being launched.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to maintain balance and give the players who need a break," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear continuation of the F block, Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most frightening in Europe.
Dinamo has also not lost in 41 matches since they produced their own "Invincible" campaign last season.
The stadium was rocked on Tuesday night by an earthquake of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned from the surrender of last season's Champions League against Monaco and is still motivated by a distant dream to lead the team to its first victory over the European Cup.
"This motivation is huge," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I can be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It is striking how there are no similar descriptions in the series, especially considering that men's need to open up is more desperate than ever, and young men's suicide rates are higher than in fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the main cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in Britain and is three times more common among men than among women.
In the attempt to tackle the problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as a year for men. The aim was to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of meeting this challenge.
In a recent study, more than 2,000 upper secondary school and upper secondary school students showed symptoms of depression. According to the study, a person's ability to recover doubled if a sufficiently high percentage of his or her friends were "healthy".
Similarly, those who were not depressed were half likely to have any mental problems if they had healthy friends.
But for friendship to work, it must be available first.
In this social media through communication time the style goes past the content and the instantity of the answer is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, joyful and successful, even though in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by the values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status, all at the expense of internal values - internal longing for personal growth and friendship - which affect our deeper mental health.
And as the billionaire video game developer recently explained, money certainly does not bring greater happiness.
The great thing about the Friends was that it turned this focus on its head.
Not one figure was defined by their work, but rather by their personality, which clearly stood out in interaction as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs, watching football, Ross missing Rachel - their humor came from the knowledge that yes, men can relate to all of this, although they often hesitate to study their emotions completely.
As a volunteer from the Samaritans explained to me: "When I listen to people who are depressed and self-destructive, I really understand how even the smallest interaction with a friend can make you feel better."
Often the men who contact us feel that they cannot talk to friends.
The old idea of "surpassing" is strong, as is the feeling that if you get out of trouble, you see it as weak.
Friends is one of those series that comes to mind when I try to provide more long-term survival methods.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
Although my neutral, external position at the other end of the phone helps people in times of despair, long - term support comes from a close, personal network of family and friends.
And so if you're going to come to the Comedy Central Friends Festival this weekend, and all the locations have been redeployed to celebrate, why don't you take your friends out for coffee in Central Perk.
Or better yet, if you see someone in Starbucks alone, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends will be sent to Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, participate in #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG slap Malmö to the side.
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored a goal in his League of Champions debut, helping PSG pass the Swedish team on Tuesday.
Below is the match report and the reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started his Champions League game with a nice 2-0 win against Malmö at Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored the Champions League in her debut for less than four minutes, pointing the way to the French league champions, but the team lost many opportunities before finally adding a head start when Cavan hit the goal by 61 minutes.
Paris, in the same Pool A with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against Sweden's league champion, because it was not only an extension but also an improvement in their quarter-final games in the last three rounds.
But even though the PSG took the points, it was not a classic game, because Laurent Blanc's team Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the place in front of the goal and later was replaced from the field. Malmö is his old hometown team and the team where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or at guests in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win will cause problems for your opponent and look good in statistics, and it's a good start, even though there are things we're going to have to work on this season," Blanc said.
This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we failed to score one or two more goals.
After the injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team in one of the three changes made after his 2-2 tie against Bordeaux in Ligue 1's home game at the weekend, but he was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentine winger was named the man who takes the PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why when he ran behind Malmö's defensive line and then struck a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland to the rear corner of the net.
However, if someone expected an easy and big victory from the PSG, they were disappointed.
Malmö was a blocked opponent who won Celtic's final match when he reached this level, its opening field has nine international players and a five-man defense, as well as two players in the deep middle field.
But on the offensive side, the team offered little more than Nikola Djurdjic's shot at the 34th minute, which barely passed Kevin Trapp's goalpost.
On the other hand, PSG was sometimes in trouble because of lost assists and poor finishing, especially from Ibrahimovic, who failed in five companies only during the first half and then was disappointed when Cavani put the ball in from Ibrahimovic's touch at the very beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more effective in pre-working for his colleagues, and it was from Ibrahimovic's pitch that Di Maria sent out a spiral kick that tilted around Wiland's goalpost at 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour's game, thanks to Cavan of Uurguay, who scored his sixth goal of the season, after Ibrahimovic had snuck forward from the left of Maxwell's cross-feed.
That was the end of Malmö's hopes of getting back into the game, and only Wiland's brilliant rejection of David Luiz's direct kick kept the final numbers down before Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal from the change was rejected at the very end of the game.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that the PSG was as high as his team. The Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which is not the same level.
I don't think we're good enough for a fight.
I'm going to take my hat to Paris.
This was a great game for them.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion in stock sales
On Wednesday, Glencore, a miner operating in Switzerland, suffered from a drop in commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion by selling shares as part of its extensive debt - reduction plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, announced that it had sold some £1.6 billion in new shares to reduce its debt.
The company that lost 57% of its market value this year is struggling with the prices of collapsed commodities, as the slowdown in the Chinese economy is burdening demand and causing destruction in all markets.
The new subscription brought Glencore's shares to the top of the London Stock Exchange at Wednesday morning shops.
Shares rose by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence in the FTSE 100 index, which opened at 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore had revealed a $2.5 billion share deal in the previous week as part of his wider plan to cut his debt of $30 billion by about a third.
The company sold a new share capital for 125 p.a. share, which meant a 2.4 per cent discount on Tuesday's closing price.
The company sold EUR 1.3 billion of shares with a total value of 9.99 per cent of the group.
Concerns over the long-standing halting of Chinese growth have cut iron ore prices by about half, while coal, copper and other commodities prices have decreased by 20-40%.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, confirmed in a statement published by the White House on Tuesday.
X's first official visit to Washington takes place on 25 September and is the answer to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November, as stated in the opinion.
The President of the United States and the First Lady Michelle Obama will arrange a dinner for Xi and her spouse, Peng Liyuan, after the bilateral negotiations have been held by the leaders.
"The visit by Mr Xi will enable us to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, and at the same time will enable President Obama and President X to discuss constructively issues with disagreements", the statement was added.
During the first visit, which was announced in February, Xin is also expected to depart from Seattle on his way to Washington to meet several U.S. technology leaders before continuing towards New York City and the September UN General Assembly.
Obama and X are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concern about China's alleged cyber-spying and the country's increased conditionality in the controversial waters of the South Chinese Sea.
Matt Damon is underestimating his differences in filmmaking.
Matt Damon ran into an African-American filmmaker named Effie Brown while they were discussing a difference that Damon said was not needed behind the scenes.
During the HBO's Sunday night Project Greenlight episode, an experienced actor interrupted Brown as he highlighted the need for different perspectives as regards the dark-skinned main character of the screenplay selected for the project.
"When we talk about differences, it's taken into account when selecting actors for a movie, not a show," Damon claimed.
Shocked Brown reacted with disbelief to the injured, commenting on "Oh! Wow. Okay." while The Martian actor's comments were hanging in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the finalists in the series.
"I want to urge people to think, whoever the director is, how they treat Harmony's character," Brown said at the beginning.
The only dark figure is the whore his white pimp beats.
The Dear White People producer demanded that the film be directed to the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon harshly replied that their guidance "could end up giving us something we don't want".
After the conversation was sent, the social media exploded to resent Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the film clipping, writing: "Matt Damon talking to the only black person in the room and explaining to him the difference is SO WHITE that it hurts."
After its publication, Tweeting collected over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon's comments coincide with a time when an accurate racial presentation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After the white police killed a teenage Michael Brown in 2014, The Black Lives Matter spread across the country and urged legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, singer Prince referred to the movement when presenting the album of the year candidates for the Grammy Prize.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
The leaders of Black Lives Matter recently published a statement to answer the question of whether the group should be considered a hate group by the television face of Fox News Elisabeth Hasselbeck.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
Recently, Damon was told that he was involved in it among entertainers, producers, and media moguls who were invited to visit the pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or already met the pope.
First American Ninja Warrior champion crowned
On Monday, Isaac Caldiero, a professional rock climber and vessel collector, became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition and received the $1 million prize as a reward.
In the competition programme, which has just finished its seventh term, there has never been a competitor who has survived all the sections of the obstacle course of the programme.
In the final episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and the cameraman Geoff Britten, survived the final round.
The last assignment was to climb a rope about 23 metres in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and settled the challenge on time, making him the first athlete of all time to figure out the exhausting fourth part of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero solved the challenge three seconds faster, which made him a winner.
Caldiero gave the interview to E!News after a difficult win and was still in shock about winning the $1 million prize.
"It's great to think of this when I've never made more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! after his big raise.
So all of a sudden... so I can't even imagine what this is gonna be like... the future is unknown.
Production Director Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Britten won't get more reward money, even though he's the first ever competitor who's managed to pass through the track.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
"If more than one person passes, the one who has the fastest time will get the money," Weed said.
Even though money is a great reward and changes life, he gets a great sense of satisfaction.
I don't think that's why he has a grudge.
He's just so happy that he's done what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy. He's a good family man.
He's the hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If anyone had to beat me, I'm happy it was Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have thought the same way if this had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior returns to the eighth period, which will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers snuck past the Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS -- The other half of the season has not been very funny to Detroit Tigers.
Tigers was once one of the best baseball teams, but is now the last in the American League Central Division.
Tigers played his prankster's role perfectly on Tuesday when it won the Minnesota Twins 5-4 Target Field.
Twins lost the chance to climb half-way from Houston Astros in a competition for another American League Wild Card place.
For Detroit, the game was for at least one night a return to the six-letter H word, which had been very difficult to reach most of the second half of the season.
"All winnings are fun, no matter how they get them," said Tigers team leader Brad Ausmus.
Tigers' pitcher Alfredo Simon continued his early offensive support when Detroit ran three times in the first two innings and then once in the sixth and once again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched six-one-three innings and released three runs.
This was only his third quality in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong end to this year," Simon said.
It's hard for a changeman to pitch in every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers' substitute Victor Martinez hit three times and allowed two runs, which were his first beatings since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-stroke night since he hit the Seattle Mariners four times on July 6.
"He waved the bat well," Ausmus said.
He looked good (in batting exercises), looked much better in batting exercises and continued the same pattern in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the second half of the seventh inning, and that was their best chance of getting back into the game.
Sentteri Byron Buxton started the inning by punching out twice on the left field line.
Aaron Hicks settled in on the right side with a one-line tap, and Simon was able to burn down second-base player Brian Dozier directly before Simon was traded for left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only player who stood up to him, Miguel Sano, the first new substitute, who pulled a two-seat run to the left of Drew VerHagen, the right-handed.
With two runners on the field and a smoothing runner on second base, VerHagen got third base Trevor Plouffe to hit a double-game goal.
It was the record of the majors: 27th time this season when Plouffe hit a double game.
After Detroit took the race to secure the ninth, Mauer ran two strokes against Tigers' sealer Bruce Rondon, and the score was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player burned down in three pitches in his fifth rescue.
Detroit first took advantage of a rusty Phil Hughes.
Tigers got three runs in the first two innings against a right-handed veteran player who got off the list of injured persons before the game after being away for more than a month due to lower back infection.
"It's obvious that I didn't want this kind of start," Hughes said, "but as the game progressed I felt more comfortable, and I felt that I was able to make a few nice assists with the third inning."
After Hughes caught the starter on first base, he let second base player Ian Kinsler advance in one place.
Walking on the right side of J.D. Martinez in two fires brought Victor Martinez to the punch, who took himself to first base with a midfield shot and caused the game's first run.
Victor Martinez cut his 0-21 tube when the runners were in good running positions.
Third base player Nick Castellanos continued to hit right and cause second run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was rejected in his attempt to advance to third base.
Tigers continued in the second inning and received one fire, two in the case of the runner James McCann and two in the case of the second inning, one in the case of the runner Anthony Gose, and then the situation was 3-0.
"It was an important hit," said Paul Molitor, team leader at Twins.
He didn't hit very well, but it flew to the right spot.
Hughes began to feed and fed the running third inning, and he was replaced by right-handed successor A.J. Achter.
Hughes had three runs for six punches and a walk for four fires.
ATTENTIONS: Tigers' right-handed pitcher, Anibal Sanchez, was cut off due to a sprain in the shoulder of the throwing arm.
He's being investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who cut off Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of injured persons since mid-August due to a shoulder spasm, but he had to return on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is out, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris comes from the injured list to start against Twins.
Norris' statistics on Tigers are 1-1 in four starts after the left-handed pitcher David Price was traded for him on 30 July.
Norris has been out since August 20, due to a rupture of the right crooked abs.
Tigers and Twins will finish their three-game series on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) stands against Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA) from Minnesota's right-handed pitcher.
Xi calls for a wider economy to be opened up to the world
The economy must open up more to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told a group on Tuesday whose task it is to guide the reform.
"China should commit itself to attracting foreign funding and expertise and developing a policy of transparency," he said at the 16th meeting of the group leading to the deepening of the general reform.
Supporting transparency at the same time as the reforms are being pushed forward with more new movement and vitality, and creating new space for economic growth," said Xi.
The Management Group adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list of market access restrictions, a relaxation of border control principles, a call for state-owned companies to take up private capital, and a review of the resident registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list will be created identifying the sectors and companies in which no investment is allowed.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through pilot programmes.
This change is significant as it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensures a legal business environment and makes the market more transparent, the opinion states.
The government also relaxes its control over the power it shares with companies, thus ensuring that companies decide for themselves how to manage their business.
The opinion also stated that China would allow border regions to explore new forms of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
In order to open up sectors dominated by the state to private donors, more sectors are opened up.
"The government will not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services," said the opinion.
In addition, the application process for permanent resident permits for foreigners, "green card", will be facilitated by optimising requirements and lightening the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of professional rights for lawyers and the support of professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as by senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, in a statement published after the meeting.
