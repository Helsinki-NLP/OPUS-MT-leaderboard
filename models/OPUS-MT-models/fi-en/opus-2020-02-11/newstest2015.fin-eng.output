The city of Juankoski will join the city of Kuopio at the beginning of 2017.
Kuopio City Council unanimously approved the alliance on Monday.
Juankoski City Council approved the merger last week.
The municipality of Tuusniemi was also involved in the settlement of the municipal union, but its council decided that Tuusniemi would continue to be independent.
Kuopio and Juankoski decide to conduct the next municipal elections separately.
Municipal elections will be held next time in 2016.
After the accession of Juankoski, Kuopio has a population of approximately 111 000.
The Prime Ministers of India and Japan meet in Tokyo

At the top of the agenda are plans for enhanced nuclear cooperation.
India has also been said to be interested in a defence cooperation agreement with Japan.
Putin: Ukrainian troops shooting civilians
On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Kiev's leadership of refusing direct political discussions with the separatists in eastern Ukraine.
The current Kiev leadership does not want to carry out the essential political debate with the eastern part of its country," said Putin, according to the news agency Itar-Tass.
He also said that the Russian-minded separatists, whom Kiev and the West say are assisted by the Russian army, tried to push Ukraine's troops further away from their current positions where Putin said that Ukrainian army troops were shooting civilians.
The goal of the militia fighters is to push out these armed forces and their artillery so that they do not get the chance to shoot the people in the area," Putin said.
The event took place on Friday and Saturday at the Ryrmi repair shop.
It surprised me that the crowd came from the very beginning of the evening.
There were visitors within two days as expected," says promoter Tom Kangas.
The River Wall Hi-hop Festival was held for the third time.
Next year again.
We are still going to be a hip-hop festival, so pop is not allowed, Kangas assures us.
On Tuesday, Finland will enter into force a law restricting the supply of explosives.
In the future, individuals will have to apply to the Police Department for permission to purchase or hold substances or mixtures that could be used as explosives precursors.
These substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate and mixtures containing them if the concentration values prescribed are exceeded.
Hydrogen peroxide is present, for example, in detergents and detergents, but concentrations generally do not exceed the limit values.
Nitromethane is used, for example, for acceleration.
However, precursors acquired before the entry into force of the Act may be held and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster is charged with assaulting Nairn and Pitlochy's hotel.
The accused of rape in two hotels is facing a trial.
George Webster, 28, heard the charges at the Glasgow Higher Court hearing.
He is charged with rape at Pitlochry's Scotland's Hotel in Perthshire Province on 7 June 2013.
Webster is accused of attacking a woman "in her unconscious state, in her sleep, and thus unable to make a decision on her own".
Webster is also charged with another rape at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn on 4 May 2014.
In accordance with the decision of Judge Lady Rae, the trial will take place on 17 November in Edinburgh at the Court of First Instance.
Champions League: Super Raheem shone - Mario was overshadowed - Champions League - Evening Sanomat
Only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling once again showed why he is considered to be the hope for the future of English football.
On Sunday, the White Hart Lane had an electronic atmosphere when Mario Balotelli's strengthened Liverpool arrived as a guest of Tottenham.
Super Mario's first appearance was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian working in the field with a completely different attitude than in Manchester City.
Balotelli was still a long way from his state-of-the-art.
The Italian lost three high-quality goals and fed only half of his sixteen pitches to his own team.
Pool supporters who already favored the player expect better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers placed Balotelli in the role of Luis Suarez, who travelled to Barcelona, as the team's second attacker alongside Daniel Sturridge.
The star of the team sparkled the tip of the middle field diamond instead of Balotelli, Raheem Sterling, who pushed a 3-0 win past the important opening goal of Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, not just with its power.
The Englishman 20 cents shorter than Balotelli is between the lines of the opponent than the fish in the water.
The property is not common to a player who runs at best at about 40 miles [34 km] per hour on the lawn.
Rodgers, too, deserves great thanks for Sterling's progress.
After the match, the Northern Irishman told us how Liverpool has systematically developed a player more comprehensive than the winger from North-West London, who grew up at Wembley's foot.
Susanna Mälkki was elected Chief conductor of Helsinki City Orchestra - "I am happy and proud"
The Helsinki City Board has decided to appoint Susanna Mälkin as the next Chief conductor of the Helsinki Orchestra since autumn 2016.
The newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times, have been asking what band he's going to take next.
Susanna Mälkki tells us that she will begin her new mission with joy and pride.
Helsinki City Orchestra has played a key role in our country's music life for over a hundred years, including by presenting a large number of Sibelius's music.
The orchestra has been led by the best Finnish conductors and I have worked with many members of the orchestra in the past.
I look forward to our future cooperation with enthusiasm," he says.
Administrations of wage-earners' organisations gathered in a matter of pension negotiations - Country - Regions - News - Karelian
A new impetus for the pension negotiations is being sought today from the social partners' own meetings.
In the morning, the administrations of the SAK, Akava and STTK employees' organisations will discuss the negotiating situation.
After that, the actual pension negotiations will continue.
Labour market organisations have been embroiled, among other things, by the dispute over the binding of retirement age to life expectancy.
The organisations have promised a career solution by autumn, but according to the latest estimate, it would be in the course of this week.
It's a plier-puss.
The Rovaniemi women's volleyball league team, Woman Volley, stumbled over the league-student vampula athletes at the finals of the training tournament on Sunday.
The vamp turned five of the long fights into a 3-2 victory.
The last round of WoVo lost 15-11.
The neighbor was one step ahead of me the whole time.
The fight was good, but in the defense game and in the passport game the Vampula was a little better, saw WoVo coach Teemu Mäkikyrö.
WoVo's spruce was so rich that Jennifer Keddy, a six-foot American centirel, had her back stuck on the side.
Sara Niemi played as the center.
Karoliina Kyllönen was able to play despite her thumb injury and formed with Johanna Pekkarinen the most powerful combination in WoVo.
Jenna Keskimäki, who started as a chipper, was allowed to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 rounds.
The best part of the vampula was a skilled Russian pastor and Libero Hillaelina Hämäläinen, who WoVo circled as much as possible.
WoVo's preparation for the league will continue at the turn of next week when Hämeenlinna's HPK comes to training camp in Rovaniemi.
The team will meet on Saturday at the "store" at 18 o'clock in the official training game.
On Sunday, we'll meet again at the sports college.
Lidl is beating wild numbers in Finland
During the financial year ending in February, the turnover of the company's stores in Finland grew by nearly 25 per cent to nearly EUR 1.2 billion.
The company released their results on Monday.
Lidl now has a total of 142 stores in Finland, and further expansion is planned.
Lidl also reported that nearly EUR 14 million in taxes were paid to Finland during the last financial year.
Lidl Finland belongs to the German Lidl Group.
The company has over 4,200 employees in Finland.
Ovarian cancer is more common in sparsely populated areas due to delayed diagnosis and access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released the video in tribute to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia have a greater risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
Researchers reviewed the patient data of more than 1,100 women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% of women lived more than five years after the diagnosis.
Chief researcher Susan Jordan from the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
SMALL RESEARCH: New medicines may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers went through women's health history over seven years.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, the age of the woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, previous diseases and socio-economic status also affected the chances of survival.
In older women and with cancer more widespread at the time of diagnosis, the probability of survival was lowest.
Women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 per cent more likely to die during the survey than women living in urban areas.
The study did not seek to determine why women living outside the city are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers the possible causes of delayed diagnosis and complicated access to treatment.
"Gynecological oncology specialists treat this disease best, and their receptions are mostly located in large cities," Jordan says.
While teleservices are becoming more widespread and the importance of distance decreases, the researcher also proposes to increase the mobility of doctors so that specialist doctors can treat patients closer to their home, as well as programmes to support patients treated far from home.
According to Dr. Jordan's study, the long - term survival rate of women with ovarian cancer is poor regardless of geographical location, stressing the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programmes.
A study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, a 33-year-old family mother living in Gold Coast, Eliza Neave, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The City of Rovaniemi wishes to strengthen the sled parking in the Friendship Park, next to Hotel Pohjanhov.
On Monday, the City Board decided to place the draft status plan of the Friendship Park and its surrounding surroundings in Osvii, a service point.
Statements are requested from the Environmental Board and Lapland Ely Centre.
With the change in the layout, the city wants to enable the continuation of snowmobile activities related to tourism in the region.
A park area is to be built to include the area between the current Friendship Park and the river.
From 15 November to 30 April, a maximum of 200 snowmobiles shall be available on the spot.
Refuelling points may also be placed in a specified part of the area.
Maintenance traffic is also allowed in the new park area.
The City of Rovaniemi has rented the area of Friendship Park to safari companies for snowmobile use during winter.
The lease was last renewed in spring 2014 and will be in force until spring 2018.
There has been even loud opposition to the sled parking and the change in design.
The inhabitants of neighboring blocks of flats have been grumpy, as well as worried about emissions.
However, emissions in the region have been investigated and there have been no findings beyond the reference values.
The reformed fleet is also less carbon-efficient than in the past.
The park of friendship as a parking lot is also supported by the fact that if the place of departure was moved further away, the safari pigs of the hotel should be transported to the safari departures by buses estimated to have 15 departures a day.
According to the city, the area of the friendship park and the surrounding area are also large enough for the sleds, better than the places of departure presented as replacements, such as the east side of the Ounasjoki bridges.
The friendship park is good for its location, even because in the future activities can expand to include the Ounaspaviljong area.
The consolidation of parking activities is part of the urban strategy approved by the Rovaniemi City Council, according, among other things, to create a good framework for business activities by providing sufficient high-quality areas for logistically and functionally advantageous locations.
The friendship park is also marked as the starting point for snowmobileing in the city centre's sub-general plan, which has not yet received legal force.
The decline of owner-occupied dwellings can be seen in garden shops
The reduction in the number of home owners, especially in the group under 35, may lead to a reduction in the turnover of garden shops by tens of millions, as young consumers today reach the "main target group" of garden sales.
According to the Financial Times report, housing rentals spend only 55 percent of the money used by homeowners in gardening.
The survey also showed that more and more people live in highly urbanised dwellings without gardens, and the size of the garden is decreasing as the front yard is increasingly paved for parking. These factors also threaten the garden sector, which is estimated to be around GBP 5 billion a year.
In the London sub-area, housing ownership has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, where gardening products are the least used per household in the whole country.
However, according to HTA and the British Garden Association (RHS), an increase in the rent of dwellings or a decrease in the size of the garden does not mean that humans cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, RHS's leading garden counselor, says that "for example, plants grown in mobile breeding vessels are particularly popular with tenants, since such breeding vessels can be included in the change if necessary".
According to HTA's report, the years 1997-2005 were the booming period for the secondary sale of the garden sector, as housing ownership and wealth increased from the late 80s to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that trade will pick up this year due to better weather conditions, worse than last year's weather in March and April.
Turkey is interrogating a U.S. diplomat about a spy report.
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has invited the country's most experienced US diplomat to provide a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Bulent, the U.S. embassy administrator and the Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The German newspaper Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept have written that documents leaked by former analyst Edward Snowden from the National Security Agency (NSA) reveal that Turkey was the main spy for US and UK intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan underestimated the significance of the report, saying that all major states have been spying on each other.
A previous report on the espionage of Ankara by Germany's main intelligence service brought about a more angry reaction in the Turkish Government.
Cannes winner Croze performs in a new Finnish film
Marie-Josée Croze, a Canadian actor in several successful films, has been attached to the leading female in the new Finnish film.
Croze plays in director Mikko Kuparinen's film 2 nights into the morning, which starts filming this week in Lithuania.
Croze won the award for the best female lead at Cannes Film Festival for his role in the Barbarian invasion in 2003.
He has performed, among other things, in Steven Spielberg's film Munich and Julian Schnabel's film Butterfly in the glass dome.
The leading man in 2 nights to morning is Mikko Nousiainen.
The film will be premiered in Finland in September 2015.
Majorcan Magaluf police chief charged with corruption
The complainants presented evidence of extortion by police officers and officials of the City Council of Calvià at the Office of the District Attorney's Office of Mallorca on Friday.
The Chief of Police of Calvià, located on Mallorca Holiday Island, has been arrested for damp celebrations following allegations of corruption made by shop owners and bar owners in the well-known Magaluf area.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was placed in custody after several owners of Punta Ballena Street filed corruption charges against him. The majority of Magaluf bars and nightclubs are located on Punta Ballena Street.
According to the online daily newspaper Mallorca Diario, those who reported the case presented evidence of blackmail by police officers and officials of the City Council of Calvià at the Office of the Prosecutor's Office against Corruption in Mallorca on Friday.
The other two local police officers were arrested by the Spanish National Guard in connection with corruption charges and are being questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
The country - wide daily ABC wrote about the anger of nightclub owners about the bias of the authorities, which made their business much more difficult.
"It's not money anymore, it's survival," said a business owner to the court.
You will not destroy our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in magazine headlines in several countries this summer when a YouTube video was released online, where an 18-year-old British holidayer had oral sex with 24 men during the so-called pub crawl.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to curb the drunken and uncontrolled behaviour of Magaluf's holidaymakers by reducing the number of participants in the infamous, alcoholic pub crawlies.
In addition, the Playhouse Night Club, where the oral sex video was filmed, was ordered to be closed for a year, and the club owner and pub crawl organiser Carnage were jointly fined EUR 55 000.
Above all, among young British tourists, the popular tourist destination of Magaluf has also become popular with the so-called balconing trend, which has caused many alcohol-related accidents when people have jumped from one balcony to another or from a balcony to a hotel swimming pool.
Israeli Children Return to School After the Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters when rockets and mortars bombed their communities during the 50 - day Israeli - Hamas war, and schools remained closed as the region recovered from battles.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in the South Israeli communities bombed by rockets, but the marks of battle are still visible.
In the southern town of Ashdod, in the Pashosh day care centre, the workers removed fragments from the walls and slided before the children arrived after the rocket hit the day care centre.
"We're a little scared but also excited," says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbuts called Saad, an Israeli commune, and works as an English teacher at a school in the city.
Many children who live in this area are sorely in need of routines.
Bart's 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, thinks that going back to school after a long time is "a little weird."
"We've had difficult times sometimes when we didn't leave home," he says.
President Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Before the end of last week's ceasefire, thousands of people in the border communities like Saad had either stayed indoors or left their homes in safer areas further away from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many of the inhabitants of the Nahal Oz community near the Gaza front are sceptical about the return of the Palestinian grenade after the killing of a 4-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, more than ten families had not yet returned.
The children of these families have so far been placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city near the Gaza border, which was under heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that "the education and safety of children would be ensured".
Israel and Hamas agreed an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The cease-fire immediately interrupted the battles, but it did not bring about a solution to a number of key issues, such as Hamas' call for the removal of the blockade in Israel and Egypt and the reopening of Gaza's air and sea roads.
Israel wants to disarm Hamas and restore the body of two Israeli soldiers who have fallen in the war.
Egypt is awaiting the start of a new round of indirect negotiations later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2 100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of dead, according to which at least half of the dead were soldiers, although they did not have any solid proof of this.
On the Israeli side 66 soldiers and six civilians died, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gaza soldiers fired 4,591 rockets and grenades into Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
The Israeli army carried out more than 5,000 air strikes and other attacks.
Israel's attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250 000 people fled to shelter for more than 100 UN schools that had been transformed into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people were still sheltered and fighting continued, school officials moved the beginning of school the previous week.
"I hope that school opens soon and we get back to school, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children," said 13-year-old Mohammad Amara, who lives in a school in Gaza.
According to a commonly used indicator, housing prices have risen most to seven years in the Australian winter months.
The price index of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic dwellings, which measures the prices of dwellings in the capital of Australia, increased by 1.1 per cent in August, was shown by RP data on Monday.
With the rise, prices rose by 4.2 per cent in June, July and August, i.e. more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual increase in prices was 10.9 per cent, which is more than twice as high as in the 12 months before August 2013, but prices have not steadily increased across the country.
According to RP Data Research Director Tim Lawless, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the price increase.
RP Data's results show that housing prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 per cent and in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent the year before.
The housing market in Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin is next the busiest; the average price increase is between 5% and 6%.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by just 1.4 per cent a year as a result of government expenditure cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring that began in Australia will increase the number of apartments for sale in the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
"In view of the rise in sales of dwellings to be auctioned, the overall high rate of sales and the continuing low interest rates, it is likely that the rise in housing prices will continue over the next three months," says Lawless.
The new Gösta Museum has drawn record audiences to Mänttä
The new museum and visual arts have attracted record audiences this summer to Mänttä.
By the end of August, more than 70 000 visitors have visited the Serlachius Art Museum.
The new Gösta Museum was opened in June and has featured classic works of pop art from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
Mänttä's Art Weeks again told me that on Monday they made a visitor record after 14 500 visitors had visited the event this summer.
These figures have not been used to.
People have stopped from the doors and windows," says Director Pauli Sivonen of the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the number of visitors to the Serlachius Museums will be close to 100,000 this year.
In previous years, there have been some 40 000 visitors.
Mänttä-Vilppula, located in the middle of Tampere and Jyväskylä, has approximately 11,000 inhabitants.
Museum Director Sivonen reminds us that new museums are always phenomena when they open up.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
In fact, it is hoped that the art season will continue far beyond the summer.
New exhibitions will be opened in the autumn at the Art Museum.
Police are investigating four thefts in the last few days in Kajaani.
On Sunday night, a break-in of a window broke into a commercial property in North Lanka.
The unsub had got a small amount of money from the cash register.
Between Thursday and Monday, there was fuel stolen from the truck tank on Deep Enonkatu.
On the other hand, between Sunday and Monday, the boat and its outboard engines had been taken from the boatport of the cheating neck.
The rowing boat was white on the outside and yellowish on the inside.
On the inside, the word "OVA" was on the side of the head.
A couple of suspects who stole it already caught up with the cops.
On Sunday night, Tikkapurontie broke into a commercial property.
The police dog got a print and a 20-year-old Paltamo man was found hiding in the woods under a tree.
On Monday, the police caught another man in Paltamo who was also suspected of committing the same break-in.
Missing amphetamines brought a murder charge in Kajaani
The disappearance of less than ten grams of amphetamines brought the murder charge to a Kajaan man born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, the man had gone into the apartment with his cohabiting partner and another man and shot the owner of an apartment he suspected to be a drug exporter, a 34-year-old Kajaan woman.
The defendant denied the charge and claimed that the other man with him was the shooter.
The case came to the attention of the police when a police patrol stopped a passenger car where a party was burning clothes used in blood work.
In addition to the burnt clothes, a severed shotgun was found in the car.
Kainuu District Court will pass judgment later.
August was unusually warm in many places.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, the same warm August occurs once every ten years on average.
Statistics from the Finnish Meteorological Institute show that the average temperature in the whole country was higher than usual.
In most countries the deviation was one to two degrees.
The heat of July and August made the whole summer warmer than usual.
The highest temperature of the whole summer was measured in Pori in the first week of August, where the meter showed 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says my father never hugged me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born into a family of seven children from Jamaica in Dudley in the British Midlands in 1958.
Henry's father worked at the factory and died when he was 19.
Henry is currently practicing for the Rudy's Rare Records comedy show, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and has been developed on the basis of a series of Radio 4 channels.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap at upbeat speeds.
Henry's had to go through some painful childhood memories.
He has often been in therapy since his mother's death, and he has a lot of thinking about his relationship with his father.
It was very difficult to read my father.
His face was never seen, only a voice said: Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I'm looking at cricket now.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, visited the pub with my father and discussed, for example, the shape of a beer sheath or the beauty of cricket.
I never talked to him about things like that.
For most of my life, he was the smileless man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal melting plant in Dudley, which gave him an idea of what his father's life must have been like, although working conditions are better today than they were then.
The melting plants are a little brighter today, but they are practically dark, smoky, labyrinthy depths, with flames, smoke, and soot, which remind me of hell.
Father used to take a bath and just lie in the tub, and slowly he started singing by himself as he washed the dirt from the melting plant off himself.
As I walked around the melting house, I realized that he had been doing that work for years to get us food for the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry's childhood lacked parental intimacy.
My father never hugged me and never said he loved me.
It wasn't until my mother began to get sick a little before she died that we began to keep telling each other that we loved each other.
Henry has a daughter, Billie, with Dawn French, and through her own child, she has been able to share the love she lacked as a child.
Do you have to keep saying, "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
Dawn French.
Why aren't we friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry is still a good friend to French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn's a good person.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to Mother's death.
When I started suffering from heavy overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to turn around.
After that, I started to exercise a lot, and I also had to start a heavy diet to reduce the symptoms.
It's very difficult —
And boring.
No one enjoys eating carrots.
Henry's well-known short beard perhaps describes his change during career development.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from the critics about his role as Othello, he is absorbed in the production of the theatre.
Next came the comedy of Mistakes and August Wilson's Fences ("Aidat").
Making the theater offers a different experience from the sitcoms and comedy Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry started in the industry when he was only a 16-year-old factory worker.
A DJ spotted him on stage doing impressions and contacted the New Faces talent competition.
Henry's TV career began in the mid-70s. "For a long time I was the only black imitator and comedian on TV," he says.
Henry learned when he was doing his job.
I had to grow up in the spotlight of publicity, I had to learn how to make jokes on a conveyor belt between 1975 and 1985, while I lived on stardom and was on television.
Lenny New Faces in 1975
Henry's manager had stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program where people appeared black in makeup, so Henry ended up as a comedian for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never taken part in it, but I do not regret it.
Although my position was strange and reprehensible, I was able to work at huge events and learn how to deal with the audience.
Still, the award-winning, multi-annual favorite and light entertainment program of the British TV was, at the same time, a grotesque parody of black people.
Henry worked in another comedy series in the '80s, where both joked and admired black British culture.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show was shown in 1984, and in the '90s Henry was known for his character as cook Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
Henry spent the next decade on ads, documents, TV shows and film parts, but after his show at the BBC in 2008, LennyHenry.tv said to himself: "What are you going to do next, Len – now it looks like you're just pedaling in your place or walking on side tracks".
Next up was the Radio 4 documentary series "What's So Great About...".
The first part dealt with Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It was not really properly taught at school, and I think it belonged to the white middle class, which wears tights and has money.
That's why I was so scared about Shakespeare.
Everyone we interviewed in the program – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me: "Try.
Don't abandon the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
You date words and you understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry said 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was sold.
I felt like I could do this.
It almost felt as if a part of me had been missing before, and now it was put in place.
"This is what it's about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your verse, do a little research.
So the training process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was carried out.
The play was finally a success.
Apparently, it was expected to fail, but not quite so.
Shortly thereafter Henry played the leading role in the comedy of Mistakes.
Suddenly I played at the British National Theatre, and I couldn't quite believe it.
At one point I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
On one occasion there were technical problems in the play, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
"A little voice in my mind said to me, 'You'll have to do 10 minutes alone until the computer works again.'"
Instead, the director's assistant announced that the presentation would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I walked out of the stage, and part of me sighed for relief.
It's not my duty.
I can leave it to the others.
"You're part of the play, stay in role"
Henry "Fences" plays at the Dutch Theatre
Learning the lines to the "Fences" play was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes you more durable.
This play was also well received, so it was like a sign from the gods; "This is what you must do."
This, of course, is what Henry says with a KEY voice.
So I decided to stick to this.
I sincerely love this job.
I love training rooms.
Henry, however, is still basically a comedian: our conversation is constantly interrupted by small pups as he changes his impressions.
Abstention from stand-up comedy is a matter of will, as receiving immediate thanks from an unknown audience seems dangerous.
If you keep thirsting for it, it could lead to a dead end.
I sometimes spend a lot of time at the Apollo Theatre when I feel that way, but generally it doesn't inspire me the way I used to.
I'm gonna ask Henry if he's going on another stand-up tour.
It gives me real joy to sit with a director who will help shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the whole journey, and I don't think I ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new rebirth?
I think so.
I like acting.
It's really funny.
You know, when you're acting, you keep telling a story, and that's what I like about it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya is drawing up a register of civil servants to remove the "ghost workers"
Kenya has started to draw up a biometric register of civil servants in an attempt to remove "ghost workers" from the government's payroll.
Employees who did not register for the next two weeks would no longer be paid, the Board of Directors' notice announced.
The government suspects that thousands will continue to be paid after leaving their official duties.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to eradicate corruption in the public sector after taking office in 2013.
According to an audit carried out earlier this year, at least one million dollars were spent a month on the salaries and other financial abuses of 'emerge workers'.
The government suspects that salaries will be paid into the account even after the person has died or left his post, the BBC's Wanyama Chebusiri reports from the capital, Nairobi.
All officials must report themselves to the register in the identification centres over the next few weeks to ensure that their data is recorded in biometric form, as stated in the Government's notice.
According to the press release, any person who fails to do this without due cause will be removed from the payroll.
"This measure significantly rationalises the public sector because it defines how many people actually work in their jobs, and it also clears pay lists at both levels of the government, thus solving the problem of 'emerge workers'," says Anne Waiguru, an official at the cabinet of the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
Seinäjoki's profit for the 2015 financial year may be EUR 25.5 million in deficit unless the city adjusts its operations and expenditure development in a tight economic climate.
Based on the current budget preparation, the annual margin is about 9.4 million in deficit.
Possible ways of enhancing efficiency were to compromise the scope and level of services and to purchase services, sell property and grants, and increase revenue from taxes and payments.
The investment target of EUR 10 million is EUR 8.5 million.
There will be no relief for the municipalities.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, inadequate growth in tax revenues, increasing unemployment and a 5% cut in state contributions further undermine the outlook.
The purpose of the economic seminar is to find new ways of balancing the economy.
The city government agrees that savings must be made.
The ship must be turned to the goal of the strategy," says Kimmo Heinonen, President of the City Board.
The City Council returned the proposals made to the management team for preparation.
The City Council's proposals will form the basis for budget preparation at the Council's financial seminar in Fram on Monday, 8 September.
After the council seminar, the budget proposal progresses through board processing to the City Council and the City Council.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested on suspicion of a "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey as suspects of "an anti-government plot", reports local media sources.
The police did not comment immediately.
According to Hurricane Daily News, 14 high-ranking police officers were arrested.
Some of the police were in contact with corruption investigations last December, targeting government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey on charges of organising a large-scale criminal gang and following telephones.
Turkey's President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who served as Prime Minister at that time) said that police action was part of the planned action of Islamic leader Fethullah Gullen and others in power.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer vacations.
This is traditionally an important day for families and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told expectant journalists that not all schools have reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The ceremonies of the first day of September were not held in every school.
There is no peace in Ukraine as a whole.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the entire huge Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukhov, a leading teacher at Slaviansk School, where Yatsenyuk's daughter goes, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally return here and that children will be able to learn lessons that will benefit them in the future.
The celebrations of the first day of school traditionally include children's written shirts, balloons, and giving flowers to teachers.
According to Perry, Texas, the abusive tweet was trespassing.
On Sunday night, a reviling picture of the Democratic District Attorney was sent from the confirmed Twitter account of Governor Rick Perry of Texas during his hearing allegations of abuse of power.
The Tweet was later removed, followed by a new tweet where Perry swore he had nothing to do with the picture.
The Tweet was sent illegally from my account.
"I don't accept tweet and I've removed it," said a later publication.
Perry's backup forces did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.
Although tweets were sent from Perry's confirmed Twitter account, it is unclear who published the photo.
The first tweet contained a reviling cartoon of Travis' district attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunken driving in April 2013.
Perry blocked Lehmberg's office when he refused to resign, which led to a grand jury meeting in Austin this month with Perry on trial. Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
The title of the Tweet was, "I don't always drive drunk, three times as high as I can... but when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for pointing fingers."
I'm the drunkest democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office didn't lead a grand jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antonio who was assigned by a Republican judge.
Perry has said he's innocent and called accusations a political plot.
His influential legal aid team has asked the judge in charge to dismiss the allegations and said that the law under which the governor in Texas's longest office is accused is unclear, mirrored against the Constitution.
Perry cut $7.5 million in state subsidies to the State's Public Inviolability Unit, which operates in Travis County and handles public sector accusations when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision led the follow-up group to make a formal complaint on the left.
Perry's enhanced Twitter account is regularly updated – and sometimes also famously.
After reaching fifth place at the Iowa election meeting during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to end the tie by publishing on Twitter a picture of himself running around the lake with the text "Here I come, South Carolina!".
Berkeley says the housing market is "normal" again.
One of London's most important developers has warned that the housing market in South-East England has "returned" to the normal level of activity.
The capital of London's apartments has been plagued by huge demand and steep price increases, while fear has been expressed of widespread credit bubbles, causing the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgages in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of a high-level developer Berkeley, said on Monday that "since the beginning of the current economic year, the market and the number of shops have returned to normal since the peak of 2013" and added that this has enabled a "stability environment".
During the recession, the housing market in London went well as foreign investors sought out a herd of capital.
According to the land register, housing prices in the city rose by 18.5 per cent only in the previous year and thus clearly exceeded the average of England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
The average sales prices of Berkeley's private, affordable and student buildings rose by around one fifth in the previous year, reaching a price increase of GBP 423,000 by the end of April.
However, the strengthened pound has made London's real estate a less attractive destination in recent months - the interest of some has also been influenced by new property tax laws and political rhetoric on the possible "tallato tax" before the May general election.
The London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage report, which reported on stricter lending provisions, would lead to a lower level of market growth in terms of both sales volumes and prices in the second half of the year.
The latest data from the Bank of England showed on Monday that the number of loans approved fell in July, suggesting a cooling housing market.
Real estate agent Hamptons International has decreased its 2015 forecast for London real estate prices. According to this, prices are falling by three per cent because the index of housing owners' views on prices has already begun to decline.
The number of shops made in the most expensive areas of London, Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has dropped in one quarter to one year ago, says Realtor WA Ellis.
However, the demand for homes in the capital is a blessing to Berkeley, who increased the income from the properties sold to over GBP 2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that "the demand for a well-designed, right type of product in the best locations has remained stable and therefore sales have remained active".
In June, the company reported that it sold 3,742 new homes in the year before April, which is almost a third more than at the peak before the economic crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profits rose by 40 per cent to one year ago, resulting in GBP 380 million and net sales increased by 18 per cent to GBP 1.6 billion.
On Monday, before the company's annual meeting, Pidgley explained that Berkeley's earnings corresponded to current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the pre-tax profit for the whole year is GBP 450 million.
Berkeley's stock sold evenly on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon at £23.96.
The hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence's naked photos online.
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards ceremony.
A hacker who claims to hold pictures of a hundred other stars leaked naked pictures of Oscar actor Jennifer Lawrence online.
The Star of Hunger confirmed that the images were authentic and condemned the hacker for "an insolent violation of privacy".
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes Jennifer Lawrence's stolen photos will be charged.
The images originally published on the 4chan photo release page had apparently fallen into the wrong hands due to the weakness of Apple's iCloud storage system. The list of hundreds of other hacking stars is claimed to have dozens of other female stars, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed.
It is not known how much of the pictures are authentic, although Scott Pilgrim versus World Star Winstead condemned hacking on Twitter.
"For those who watch pictures taken by me and my husband in the privacy of our home years ago: I hope you feel good," Winstead tweeted.
But Victoria Justice of the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" denied the authenticity of the images and tweeted that "these so-called naked pictures of me are WRONG, don't you understand"?
Let me put an end to this right in the bud.
BuzzFeedin announced late Sunday that the pop star Ariana Grande's representative banned the authenticity of the images of the star.
Only we have an extract of Howard Jacobson's praise for the new novel about love and the letter "J"
They dissolved, it best described what had happened, gradually falling apart like a cardboard box left in the rain.
Only from time to time did she hear from the woman that she was too serious, too hard, intense, detached, and perhaps also a little thorny.
That's when he waved his hand.
He recognized the spike.
Yes, he was thorny, like a hedgehog.
The latest victim of his thorns had been in the early stages of a promising relationship; it had seemed that this relationship could have eased his loneliness, perhaps bringing even some substance to his life.
Ailin Solomons had untamed hair and was a delicate beauty with a heart of joy, from a northern village that was even more harsh and further away from everything than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older traveling companion, whom Kevern assumed would be his aunt. She had inherited a house in a damp but paradisaic valley, and the name of the valley was fittingly called Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
The pipes were leaking, all the bathrooms had spiders, snails had left their mark on the windows holding the whole place as their own, weeds were growing in the garden, similar to giant cabbage heads.
The cottage was like a children's fairy tale, at the same time threatening and magical, a garden full of secrets.
Reported by the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is nominated for the Booker Literature Prize in 2014.
The nominations will be published next week
Kevern had sat hand in hand with Ailinni on a broken terrace chair in the middle of a long hay, enjoying a surprisingly warm afternoon in the spring, both listening to a disoriented receiver through which the whole country heard soothing music and soothing news when the cross - crossed, sun - browned feet of Ailinni reminded Kevern of a song sung by a long - forgotten black performer and which his father had often listened to at the bottom of the cabin blinds.
Your leg's too big.
Such songs were, in principle, too aggressive and no longer played in the receiver.
They had not been banned — nothing was actually banned — they were just no longer played.
They wanted to leave them in oblivion, as did the word oblivion itself.
Public opinion brought about what law and decree had not achieved: just as in literature people chose to read heroes' memoirs, cookbooks and romances, they favored ballads in music.
In the wild of the day, Kevern began to pick up the imaginary piano and sing serenadia to the big feet of Ailinni with an arrogantly convoluted voice.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"It was a famous song by jazz pianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, while naturally raising two fingers in front of his mouth.
This was what his father had always done before the letter "j" could escape his lips.
It had begun as a game between him and Dad when he was little.
His father told me he played the same game with his own father.
If you let the word that starts with "j" out of your mouth and you didn't remember to raise two fingers in front of your mouth, you'd have to pay a penny.
It wasn't a very funny game back then, and it wasn't one now.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard such a thing.
Jazz wasn't actually banned either, it just wasn't played.
Improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was only room for one if word in life.
When the song started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same thing happened to witty.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was the cleverness of music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior by 10 years of age, jazz music had become familiar to him through his father's semi-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailinn Fats Waller was black.
In view of Ailinn's age, it was likely that he did not remember the time when popular singers were not black.
Here, too, there was no need for laws or coercion.
Obedient society meant that each part of it was grateful — thankfully, that they had been saved by luck — by the principle that each group did the natural things for it.
Based on their temperament and physical characteristics, people with African-Caribbean genealogy are best suited to entertain and sports, so they sang and ran.
Originally, those from the Indian continent were naturally gifted with electrical equipment, so it was up to them to make sure that every family had a working telephone that was used to handle matters.
Those remaining in the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke plates.
When what happened, IF IT HAPPENED, those from the Gulf and the Middle East, whose grandparents had not fled quickly in fear of being accused of burning flames and fearing that the flames would next reach them, opened restaurants serving Labneh yogurt and burning a water pipe, and continued their lives with their eyes on the ground created and depressed with boredom.
Let each man act according to his gifts.
Ailinn had only heard ballads, and it was hard for her to understand how the offensive words that Kevern just sang could ever be dressed as music.
Love was expressed through music.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe for the big-footeds.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but an abandoned garden created an illusion of safety.
No word would pass through the sound insulation of giant head cabbage leaves.
Still, Ailinn didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to raise two fingers to his lips with Ailinn.
Ailinn thought he was weird already.
"My dad thought it was funny," he said instead.
Ailin shook her head in disbelief, and her hair covered the field of view of Kevern.
Nothing to see in the whole world except the huge, crow-black hairball of Ailin.
That's all he wanted to see.
"If you say so," he said, but he didn't sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
Ailinn seemed genuinely confused.
Are my legs that big?
He looked again.
Your legs aren't really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was still too early for that.
"I find you attractive because of your thick ankles," he tried to fix the situation.
I'm twisted in that sense.
This didn't help.
He wanted it to sound like fun.
Often, when he wanted to make fun, the effect was quite different because he, like his father, lacked the convincing charm to control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite his gentle eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and rose from his terrace chair and poured the receiver and spilled the wine they had just drank.
The wine was made only from selenium flowers, so he could not use it as a reason for collision.
In his nervousness, he seemed to shake like palm leaves in a storm.
"And your thick head is what attracts me twistedly in you," he said...
Except I don't feel that way.
Kevern felt sorry for Ailinn, both because of his own, unnecessarily cruel words, and because of the fear that appeared in his eyes at the moment when Ailinn decided to stand up to him.
Did Ailinn think he'd hit you?
He had never told Kevern about life in the icy northern archipelago, where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that it had basically been like life here.
The same huge, icy sea that waved against them.
The same confused men, though even paler and devilisher than their smugglers and deportors, wandered from the pub to the pub, ready to strike every woman who dared to resist or tease them.
Thick head?
He'd see a fat fist if he wasn't careful!
Suck first — kissing had become the most common word for the erotic encounter between man and woman; the antidote to the meaningless love ballads pumping out the receiver — suck first and attack then.
Kevern felt that too was too much, for the absorption itself was already hostile.
Ailinn Solomons' body language told him to leave.
He pulled himself out of the terrace chair like an old man.
Ailinn also felt exhausted, but he was surprised by the depth of Kevern's grief.
This wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn followed him — just as his traveling companion watched Kevern go upstairs through the window — a man who was responsible for his heavy life.
Adam leaving the garden, he thought.
He was feeling sorry for Kevern and the men in general, even though some of them had raised their hands against him to strike.
The man who had turned his back, bowed down, ashamed, beaten, lost all the will to fight — why did he feel that he was so familiar with that vision, even though he did not remember that he had ever seen such a vision before this moment?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, she looked at her feet.
A few years before the event just described, the intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked in a general opinion-measuring private institution in Ofnow, did a short study of the continuation of low and medium-level violence in areas of the country where the reduction, or even the end, of violence was most likely taking into account the money and energy used to eradicate it.
"A great deal has already been achieved and much remains to be done," he wrote, "in order to compensate for the natural aggression of a people who have fought for thousands of years and who most often won, especially in those abandoned and remote parts where, despite the crests over the hedges, humanity has rarely been known over time.
Some things, however, cannot be completely removed.
The higher the tower, the lower the desires it creates.
The people weep among sentimental ballads, devour the stories of overcome hardships and swear in the name of the virtues of marriage and family life, but at the same time the old-fashioned cruelty persists in gripping both rural communities and urban community areas, and there is evidence of a new, more evil-souling desire to fight in homes, workplaces, our streets and even playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to dramatize," his director commented after reading the full report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum laid her eyes on the ground.
And I have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme continued to appeal to her right not to answer personal questions.
Feminist?
Once again, silence.
"I don't ask," Luther Rabinowitz said, "because I'm opposed to atheism, lesbian sexuality and feminism.
There are no prejudices in this workplace.
We are servants of an open - minded society.
Although a certain type of hypersensitivity is perfectly acceptable and respectful in itself, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, such as what you just presented to me.
Clearly, you have something against the church — and what you call cruelty or evil - souledness — others usually call natural energy and physical strength.
Wrote what happened, IF IT HAPPENED, as if it had happened yesterday, if it had happened at all, will destroy the earth's fundamental vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz was talking.
Behind Rabinowitz's head, the flamingon-pink LED light proclaimed a guide that Ofnow had already distributed to the country for a quarter or more of the previous century.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to the ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence and the word sung is better than written, but nothing beats love.
"I understand what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum replied in a quiet voice when he was sure that his director had finished, "and I just want to say that we are not as effective in healing as we imagine ourselves to be.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will find ourselves repeating the same mistakes that originally led TO WHAT HAPPENED IF HAPPENED.
True, this time we do not shed our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "as you describe 'mistakes' as what our grandparents may have done or not done.
You also go too far when you say that they poured out their 'hate and distrust of others'."
A person like you should not have to remind you that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we are not talking about 'us' or 'them'.
There was no 'us' or 'the others'.
It was a time of chaos, that's all we know about it.
"If we are quite honest, in that chaos," Esme ventured to continue, "no group in society can say that they have behaved well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done was done, whether it is good or bad.
That's when it was.
We do not need to talk about it any further – we agree on this.
And just as it is unnecessary to share accusations, there is no need to make corrections, whether they are justified or not, and even if there is a way of making them.
But what's the past for if you don't learn from it --
The past exists so we can forget about it.
If I may add one more thing --
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'm going through your report," he said and indicated that it was time for Esme to leave.
The next day, when he went to work as usual, he was struck by a motorcycle driver on the sidewalk, whose driving was described by passersby as "evil and fierce".
Accidents happen.
Lesotho's army forbids the attack; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Lesotho's army officials have denied that they had staged a blow to overthrow the government and said that they were acting against a police officer who was suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country saying that the army had surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in Maseru, the capital city.
The Head of State and his family traveled to a neighbouring country in South Africa after telling us that he was threatened with death.
The military representative, Major Ntle Ntoi, denied the attack and said that the army thus responded to a threat from 'political fanatics', who have been said to have tried to arm fanatics.
"Lesotho's armed forces took action after receiving several intelligence reports that some police forces are trying to arm young party fanatics when they are ready to cause problems," he told the Voice of America News Office.
According to Clayson Monyela, president of the South African Government, the military's actions looked like a revolutionary attempt.
"While no one has claimed to have overturned the government by force, Lesotho's actions seem to be fully consistent with the signs of a revolutionary attempt," he says.
According to Lesotho's army officials, soldiers return to their barracks on Sunday, and the capital had a calm atmosphere.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will lead the government in the absence of Thabane.
Thabane says he believes that he is the target of action because he has tried to fight corruption.
There have been tensions in Lesotho since June when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to disagreements between the government of the great coalition.
He thus denies his contempt for government power, even though it is claimed otherwise.
Kauppalehti: Microsoft establishes a data center in New Zealand
Microsoft, an IT company, has set up a large data centre in New Zealand, where the company refuses to specify its location.
In a press release sent by Microsoft to the media, the company notes that it does not indicate the location of all its data centres for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the centre is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It's an investment of several hundred million dollars for Microsoft.
In public, Oulu or Kajaan had previously been put at the centre.
Microsoft will completely end its Oulu office, which will take up the job for about 500 people.
In all, Microsoft has announced that it will terminate up to 1,050 jobs in Finland.
Camilla Lindfors, Microsoft Communications Director, says to STT that the company does not comment on how many employees the new data center employs.
On Monday, Kauppalehti told us about the creation of a data center in New Zealand.

Four tips for better underwater images and videos
If you want to take pictures or videos under water, you have several different devices to choose from.
The most affordable option is a water-resistant, compact point-and-shot camera, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both cost about $300.
I myself took these pictures at a family party using several different cameras, each of which cost less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules worth following.
Always double-check your device.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery and other parts of the camera are waterproofly closed.
In addition, set camera imaging settings to match images or video to be taken.
Some cameras or combinations of camera and video camera have a setting to optimise underwater imaging conditions.
In addition – before you jump into the water, make sure how deep your device can take.
Some cameras can only hold 5 feet, others up to 50-60 feet.
Check out both standard and waterproof models in our purchase guide and digital camera reviews.
Take several pictures — many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD display that allows you to compose the image, while action cameras often don't have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it's hard to see underwater, and the composition of the picture can either succeed or fail.
So take several pictures.
If your camera also allows for branching, which means taking multiple images at once with different settings, take advantage of this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
Light will decrease significantly deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface when describing in the swimming pool, lake or sea.
This will also give you more colors; the deeper you go, the less colors you see.
Try to get close to the target we're shooting.
This is important advice when filming on land, but even more important under water, because light conditions are scarce.
It is very important when an action camera is used: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of view, i.e. the photographer must be close to the target so that the object fills the whole picture up to the frames.
China does not allow Hong Kong to choose its leaders – protestors swear revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided that Hong Kong voters should not be allowed to choose candidates for the 2017 elections despite the growing unrest that calls for democratic reform.
The decision is likely to spark the long-awaited protests of Hong Kong's business block after activists began to plan and implement demonstrations only hours after the decision was published.
The decision of the People's Congress in China basically gives Communists the power to eradicate all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
"This was to be expected, but it is still exasperating," says Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
This isn't what Beijing promised.
They've been lying to the Hong Kong people.
It is clear that we are working with an autocratic regime.
Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the People's Congress Committee of China, defended the Chinese regime, saying that a general nomination for the Hong Kong leader would be too "footic".
From 1997 onwards, when Great Britain handed over Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised the residents of the region that it would be free to choose its leader from 2017 onwards.
According to the Chinese leaders, Sunday's decision was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but it also makes it clear that China wants to strictly control the electoral process through the nomination committee, which is governed by Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be accepted.
The summer before the decision, Hong Kong held some of the largest and most prominent protests in the region for years.
The campaign for democracy was largely backed by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organisers have threatened to block the business block if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong a genuine universal right to vote.
On Sunday night, only hours after the decision was published, hundreds of supporters of Occupy Central gathered in rain in front of the Hong Kong headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organisers announced the move to a new era of civil disobedience and would generate protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, apparently they did not give details, fearing that this would lead to problems with the authorities.
In a press release published online, the organisers said that the movement "considers Occupy Central a last resort, which will only be introduced if there is no hope of dialogue and there is no other way".
We are very sorry to announce that today's last opportunity for dialogue has failed and the invasion of the centre will take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday the security measures were tight near the main government buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, unrest is fueled by the feeling that the inhabitants are slowly losing control of their city.
The wave of people from the continent has created competition for products and services.
There is also the fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are disappearing under the increasing pressure of Beijing.
Some have criticised the Occupy Central movement because its demonstrations threaten Hong Kong's survival — the business world.
"The protest they are talking about can lead to major economic losses, depending on how many people take part in it and how long it lasts," says the legislator Regina Ip, who has long criticised the movement.
We do not want concerns to spread that Hong Kong is slipping out of our grip.
Such an image would be bad for investment.
There have also been stories in the Chinese media that the democratic activists in Hong Kong are the minions of the Western powers that fuel revolution."
This summer, activists held an informal referendum on voting rights involving 780 000 people – more than one fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the region.
The prom tradition of the United States strikes British universities: private jets for new students
We are eager to respond to demand by establishing Britain's first luxury form of travel for today's students.
In addition to a private aircraft, the company also offers other means of transport, such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, so that the customer can ensure that the university is as memorable as possible.
Stewart also says that there is a safety aspect to the service.
The service is the best option for students who would otherwise drag their property across the country in loaded cars.
When this is combined with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to offer today's students as easy and high-quality transportation as possible to the university.
According to the company's representative, no reservations have yet been received because the service has just been established, but added that "students will start ordering over the next few weeks".
The company believes that there is a demand for the service, although most students pay £9,000 a academic year.
Today's students are very different from those who started their studies 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now it is more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is just the way to do it.
However, the National Student Association criticises a service that is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, vice-president of the university section of the organisation, "this service plan seems to be a long way from the life of the student majority".
Many this month's studies begin to be shocked at the level of living costs, as the financial support available in the form of loans and grants has fallen behind the huge increase in basic living costs. Only next thing you can begin to wonder where thousands of people could be used for something as simple as getting on campus.
Ipswich "pighouse" for sale
Real estate agents removed the image of a house for sale in Suffolk when they discovered that a large pig is lying in the house's living room.
A one-bedroom house with a price of £120,000 is located on a private road in Ipswich.
The ad included a picture of the living room where the pig leaned his head on the couch.
According to the realtor Connells, the pig in the picture is the owner's pet.
"However, the picture ended up in the report by mistake and has since been deleted," says the company's representative.
In the announcement Connells describes the former meeting house as "a unique one-bedroom house".
Although real estate has removed the image from its website, it is still visible in ads.
The sale of the house has attracted interest in social media, which has asked if the pig is included in the price of the house.

The accident in the suburbs of Rosny-sous-Bois on Sunday injured 11 people, four of them seriously.
Rescue workers were still searching the ruins of the house for survivors on Monday, but the hope of finding the survivors faded.
The preliminary cause of the explosion is a gas leak.
The explosion occurred early on Sunday and was so powerful that it shook buildings within a radius of 100 meters.
Our whole house was moving. We were shaking out of fear.
The explosion was so powerful that our ears rang," described Maryline Yyvon, next door to the crash site.
As early as Sunday, emergency accommodation for the residents of the house was set up in a nearby school.

National protest by Bulgarian prison staff
Hundreds of prison workers throughout Bulgaria demonstrated themselves before the Ministry of Justice of the capital city Sofia.
At a peaceful demonstration, they declared that they wanted back the old working rules, which were recently amended.
The increase in wages is also to be discussed with the Minister of Justice, Mr Hristo Ivanov.
For a month, prison officials have been protesting symbolically against new working hours, saying that they want to return to the old 24-hour shift system.
Despite the meeting of representatives of the prison workers' association and the Ministry of Justice, there was no agreement on this issue," says the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
Negotiations are currently taking place, Mr Rosen Zhelyazkov, Director of the Directorate-General for the Enforcement of Judgments, told BNR.
The protest of the prison workers' association is also expected to involve members of the Ministry of the Interior's trade union.
Basketball: Fan encouragement almost too much: Sasu Salin almost fainted into the field
Basketball Sasu Salin was the embodiment of Finland's victory today.
He was able to forget his rosy U.S. fights and beat Ukraine's second-half-time blood with his stagnant solutions.
But Salin transferred all the credit to the wolf fans and did it in style:
I was about to pass out at the end of the field, that encouragement was so awesome.
In his eyes, it was blurry. There was nothing he could do.
That noise and the white public sea was almost too much for me.
Salin's power moments contained nine pins at a fast pace, ball-thrus, disks and tangled around the place where it happened.
I don't know how that happened, but I got into a flow mode like that, so it all worked out.
They just come from somewhere sometimes, now to an incredibly important place, Sasu was glowing.
That's my role.
To do all that.
Now it was great to see that others caught up with the plot.
He grabbed the whole gang.
Salin is the team's joy pill and spirit creator, so it's no wonder that his example raised the whole team to a flight that was too much for the big, rough Ukraine's five.
After a 32-year break in Finland at the World Cup: The formers had a blasphemous judge's game in mind
Heikki Montonen (right) who carried the bag was Finland's main coach at the Argentina World Cup in 1982.
It has been 32 years since Finland's men's volleyball team last played in the World Cup finals.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was Finland's second coach and the current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament as if it were yesterday: it was a hot fight against France in the early part.
"In the finals of that match, the judge game was glaring," Kosonen recalled.
We had already won, and both teams had already settled on the backline.
All of a sudden, the game went on.
We lost it 2-3 and then the shit went crazy more," said Parkkali.
Finland played under the command of head coach Heikki Montonen and eventually finished 17th.
Now Finland is back among the world's selections as the Polish World Cup takes off today on Saturday.
Many things have changed dramatically in international volleyball over the past 32 years.
The player's power values are about the same as before, but there is now more quality and skill.
The average lengths of players have also increased.
The game is faster," thought Parkkali.
But what about Poland?
Finland's player material has expanded and the burden can be shared.
I expect Finland to be able to get out of the pre-section.
Then it can be tough," Kosonen estimates.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were in a victory match against Tunisia.
Current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the World Cup tournament.
Let's hope we're getting 17th place now.
South Korea and Tunisia should go down," said Parkkali.
Genie legend Reino Kosonen was number two coach of the national team in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö aired in the Tunisia match.
Sauna and evening entertainment at Buenos Aires Seamen's Church were part of the national team's programme at the World Cup in 1982.

The finals of the Young Star Song Competition were competed for no victory in South Karelia.
Veera Vento and Veeti Tikkanen, who entered the finals of the Young Star Song Competition, did not make any progress in winning the competition.
No other investments were published in the competition.
According to singer Teija Immonen, the competition has been popular.
It's a good experience.
The finalists will record the songs of the competition.
Competition moments always leave great memories," says Immonen.
Finnish tourists rescued Cita from a mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all credit"
When Merethe Mikkelsen and his dogs in trouble in the mountains on Thursday, Antti and Tuomo Soini bravely offered to help.
On the weekend Mikkelsen looked for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank his helpers one more time.
Mikkelsen said in a public Facebook update that the Cita dog with him in the mountains on Thursday hurt his paws.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk in steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to lure it and pull it a little further, but its legs didn't just carry it," Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, there was no help from the police, from the nearby hotel or from passers-by.
As the night went dark, the situation began to look threatening.
Fortunately, two hikers were present who were ready to help: Antti Soini of Tampere and Tuomo of his father.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway in Galdhøpiggen and headed to their camp site when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain slope.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm about the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog," Antti Soini says in a message to Ilta-Sanom.
Soon a German man came along with a hiking mattress.
From the mattress to Cita, they got the kind of gurneys that the injured dog was attached to.
The German man came in a moment after us, after we thought about what to do with the dog and carried the dog down the slope for a while," Soini says.
FIGURE: Tuomo Soini
The dog was carried down with the help of an expedition mattress.
According to Soin, the performance was not physically heavy, but carrying in difficult terrain was slow.
After about an hour and a half, however, Cita was happily brought down.
After what happened Mikkelsen was still looking for "international heroes" on Facebook so he could thank them once more.
The soins answered him on Sunday, but apparently the German man is still unreachable.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen is happy.
If they hadn't helped me, we might not have come back.
I'd like to find these people because I feel like I didn't thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all the praise and honor, and I am eternally grateful to them.
The night before Monday, the Soins were already on their way home.
They'd had some happy news from Mikkelsen. They said Cita was feeling better!

Genetic abnormalities are often misdiagnosed
For years, a British woman feared death because of a false diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of his youth had only a few years left to live because he had been diagnosed with another disease.
In reality, he suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). It means a number of hereditary diseases that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
According to the Charity CMT UK charity, misdiagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases, because so little is known about them.
It is estimated that around 23 000 people in the UK suffer from CMT disease, which causes symptoms in motors such as muscle weakness, difficult walking and toes curling up.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and it is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he thought he had Friedreich's ataxia (FA) with a very low survival rate.
Rodgers thought he'd be in a wheelchair before he turned 18 and died before he reached 30 years of age.
Now a 51-year-old mother of two children says, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same things as the others.
I fell every day, and everything took longer than anyone else.
I was never able to skate or skateboard with other children, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently from others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he had several Achilles tendon surgery to straighten his legs. In connection with the surgery, after the doctor left the room, he quickly looked at his research papers, which said he was suffering from FA disease.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, I checked the medical records in the library and wrote to the FA association," he says.
When I received information from them, I was shocked and panicky.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair by 18 years of age and die before I turned 25, and in between I would slowly lose my full capacity.
I went through this by myself and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers reports that by 17 years of age he found that his walk had not deteriorated as much as he thought it would and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said, "Girl, I don't think you have this disease because otherwise you'd already be in a wheelchair."
I think you're suffering from something far less dangerous.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
"When I was told what CMT was, I thought I was lucky," he says.
Charity CMT UK organises a CMT month to pay attention to the disease.
A hundred immigrants were found in a coal wagon in Macedonia.
More than 100 illegal immigrants have been found by the Macedonian authorities on a train carrying coal, the Ministry of the Interior reported on Monday.
Smugglers were mostly Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
Migrants were found late Sunday in Veles, Central Macedonia.
It was hard to communicate with most of them.
They didn't know where they were coming from, where they were coming from and where they were going," said Ivo Koteski, a publicist at the Ministry of the Interior.
According to the police, migrants had paid around EUR 3 000 each to get to Greece, and another EUR 800-900 to get to Serbia.
Illegal immigrants travel extensively through a couple of million inhabitants of Macedonia on their way to Western Europe.
Three million people have already fled the bloody civil war in Syria.
Guardian: Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai support Scotland's independence
The pop groups Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai have joined the supporters of Scotland's independence.
According to Guardian magazine, in a couple of weeks the bands will star at a concert in Edinburgh to support the independence project.
A referendum on Scotland's independence will take place on 18 September.
In his press release, Mogwai said that voting is an opportunity for the Scots, which only happens once in a lifetime.
In the past, among other things, actor Sean Connery has given his support to independence.
Instead, British stars Paul McCartney and David Bowie, for example, have appealed to Scotland to keep them part of Britain.
In the Gallup, the supporters of independence have been defeated.
Difficulties in department stores continued in midsummer - Domestic news - Evening-Sanomat
The fall of the department store also continued in July, says the Finnish Trade Association.
According to it, turnover in department stores and hypermarket chains was 3.2 per cent lower in July than one year ago.

Dressing products also sold clearly less well than in the summer before.
By contrast, the value of retail sales of daily goods grew by nearly three per cent year-on-year in July.
Sales grew most in small stores and large supermarkets.
The turnover of department stores and hypermarkets has contracted by more than two per cent throughout the early part of the year, i.e. in January to July.
Sales of daily goods, on the other hand, have increased by nearly one per cent.

Areva-Siemens: Olkiluoto's 3rd reactor is completed in mid-2016
Areva has provided the Industrial Power TVO with an updated schedule of Olkiluoto 3.
According to Areva's press release, the recent delays in the project have been mainly due to the application for approval of reactor automation systems.
The project is already years late.
In May, TVO did not provide any estimate of the time of completion of reactor three.
Nastola donated 1.4 hectares of beach property to Bottas - worth about 60,000 euros
The municipal government of Nastola donated a 1.4-ha beach property to Valtteri Bottas from Lake Kärk from Villä.
The municipal government showed a fair sense of sports and was unanimous in its decision.
There was no gravel noise at the meeting when the property was decided on," says Mayor Pauli Syäraki.
Bottas' gift property has farm buildings - seven copies in total.
The municipality will disassemble them this year, except for one.
Bottas has promised to build a leisure home on the property within two years.
We are impressed that he has enjoyed his birthplacer and wants to continue to be here.
Valtteri has visited primary schools every year to tell about her sports career and her life.
And hopefully it will continue to be," says the mayor.
The municipal manager estimates the beach property to be worth EUR 40,000 to 60,000.
The beach is shallow and child-friendly.
The area has been owned by the municipality for over ten years.
Over the decades, Nastola has, with varying success, been using gift plots to keep successful sportsmen in the municipality.
The world champion Aki Parviainen and Aerobick's world champion Tuuli Matinsalo got home plots from the municipality and built the funky detached houses.
But instead of staying in Nastola, they sold their property and moved out.
Parviainen and Matinsalo came to Nastola after work and then changed their life situation elsewhere.
Bottas is a native of Nastola, and his situation is different, Syaraki says and believes that Bottas is staying in his municipality of residence.
Hull hired the attacker with a record sum of Hernandez's company.
The Champion League Club Hull invested the club's record sum in the purchase of Abel Hernandez, the national team member of Uruguay.
Hernandez will switch the Italian club from Palermo to Hull for £9.5 million, or around €12 million.
It's a three-year deal.
Hernandez scored 14 goals last season when Palermo won Serie B and went to Italy's major series.
In the Uruguay national team, he has scored seven goals in 14 matches.
In last summer's World Cup final, Hernandez entered the field in two matches.
Abel is a fantastic acquisition and shows how far we have come in a short time," said Hull's head coach Steve Bruce.
On Monday, Hull also reported having acquired Senegal's national team captain Mohamed Diamen from West Ham.
The Russian space experiment failed - the geckos sent on a sex trip died.
The five little geckos sent into Russian space have died, says Roscosmos, the Russian Federation Space Agency.
The Gekos traveled on a Foton-M4 satellite for more than a month and a half.
The satellite returned to the country on Monday morning Finnish time.
The purpose of the experiment was to study the reproductive capacity and use of geckos in a weightless state.
One male gecko and four females participated in the experiment.
Although the experiment sounds bizarre, its purpose was serious.
The effects of weightlessness on the development of geckos' eggs, for example, are little known.
The effects on the geckos can be used to predict the effects that weightlessness would have on a person while he is living in a state similar to longer periods of time, illustrated by New Statesman in July.
According to Roscosmos, the time of death and cause or causes of death of geckos are determined.
According to the news agency Interfax, passengers who were cross-referenced as "sex geckos" were frozen.
The surprise is also shown by the fact that fruit flies that traveled with the same Foton-M4 were able to survive the trip without difficulty and also had offspring.
France arrested a terrorist suspect at the airport in Nice
France arrested a man suspected of terrorism at the airport of Nice on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected of being a recruiter of a jihadist group in Syria.
The French authorities informed the Commission on Sunday.
The authorities were able to track him down after he had used money to lure a 16-year-old girl to go to Syria.
The girl was to fly to Turkey and then cross the Syrian border.
The airline did not believe the girl's explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but alerted the authorities.
The authorities contacted the girl's father, who was completely unaware of her daughter's intentions and told the authorities that the family had no family in Turkey.
According to the authorities, the man is from Chechnya, but he now lives in France.
The French intelligence authorities had already followed the man's actions.
In France, the authorities have been concerned that the radicalised young people who lured Iraq or Syria into war also pose a security risk to France.
The authorities estimate that some 800 French citizens, or those registered in France, have travelled to Syria, returned from Syria or are currently planning to go to Syria.
Koponen: We have a good chance of winning
The wishes of the basketball team for a post-op are at stake when Finland meets Ukraine in its second World Cup match today.
If the opening loss to the United States was expected, Ukraine will be one of the countries from which Finland should take the necessary profits to the extension site.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I think we have a good chance of winning, Petteri Koponen anticipates.
On Saturday, Ukraine won the games in its first match in the Dominican Republic between 72 and 62.
The team is coached by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, under whose command Ukraine plays aggressive basketball.
Ukraine's key player is the game leader Eugene "pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a 100-metre world champion from three years ago.
The Dominican Republic against Jeter scored 16 points.
Pooh Jeter fast guy, but we've played them before and we have to get our standard defense in order," Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland would play better than yesterday's defeat for the United States.
We need to find our own strengths again.
I can guarantee you there'll be a normal pack of wolves in the field," Möttölä said.
The alleged naked images of Hollywood stars spread online - some confirmed as genuine
There are a number of naked pictures on the Internet that are claimed to be known public figures.
The actor Jennifer Lawrence, among others, has been the victim of a "naked image campaign".
The entertainment websiteTMZ has published an angry comment from Lawrence's representatives that seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a blatant violation of privacy.
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes Jennifer Lawrence's stolen pictures (on the Internet) will be prosecuted, the representatives will threaten.
According to T.C.Z., actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the images that spread about her are genuine.
He had taken these pictures years ago with his husband.
When I know that those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what a terrible trouble was experienced for this purpose.
I have sympathy for everyone who was the victim of hacking, and he writes according to the site.
Instead, actress Victoria Justice calls images under her own name faked.
There are genuine or counterfeit naked pictures of Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovsky and Teresa Palmer.
Honka goaltender criticizes his own: "They don't work hard enough to get out of here"
The football club FC Honka is currently in the final position of the betting league.
The comments made by goaltender Walter Viitala after Sunday's VPS match illustrate the confusion of the club's current situation.
I haven't had a goalie coach in four months.
But you have to adapt to everything," Viitala said after the battle that ended with the 1-2 defeat.
In the first half of the game, Honka made a lot of defense head mistakes.
The goaltender Viitala wasn't happy with the bad defense game.
Player traffic in Honga has been busy this summer, and therefore the defenders in front of Viitala have also changed rapidly.
With the gamer roulette, many young players have also gained opportunities that they might not even deserve.
"Some people don't work hard enough to get out of here sometimes," Viitala snuck out without naming any single player.
Honga's head coach Shefki Kuqi agreed to some extent with Viitala.
"I told certain players after the game that if you come to practice and games to have fun and think you're a betting league player and don't have to work, you're probably on the wrong team," Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of kids some time to play.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of it, it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also pointed out that players cannot expect immediate success when gambling partners are constantly changing.
This period has not had the same composition twice in a row.
Especially when you're on the defensive, you've changed your people.
That is the main reason why we are in this position," said Kuqi.
After the VPS loss, Honka will be a serial jumbo with the second last TPS.
There are still seven rounds left in the betting league, so the Espoans still have time to avoid falling into Number One.
I've never dropped a team, and I'm not gonna do it now.
We're not going to fall out of this show," goalie Viitala said.
Lars von Trier doing a television series after decades of break
Film director Lars von Trier is going to be back on TV.
The Danish director is preparing a TV show called The House That Jack Build.

Lars von Trier, 58, has in recent years been known for his tumultuous media appearances and films such as Antichrist and Nymphomaniac.
In the 1990s, he directed the Kingdom Series to television.

British Isabelle Roberts roared so hard when ice - cold water was poured on her that she damaged her face's bones.
This Ice Bucket challenge ended painfully badly.
The woman has been taken to treatment for her karmic Ice Bucket challenge while performing so hard that her jawbone dislocated.
Isabelle Roberts roared so hard when ice - cold water was poured on her that she damaged the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold that I just roared, but as I roared, I felt that my jaw began to stiffen," she tells The Mirror.
Ice water is poured on a 20-year-old.

I tried to shut up, but I couldn't, my jaw was locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister noticed the same thing and began to laugh, but I had to be rushed to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old British who took part in the Super Popular Challenge on Tuesday was taken to the hospital where the jaw was put back in place.

A View of Wolfs Howling (also): How can you explain the growing number of fans?
I was feeling really great today.
This was said by basketball player Sakari Pehkonen in 1995, after Finland had played against France in the Marouss Balling Hall in Athens.
It wasn't that much of a big deal. It wasn't that big of a deal.
I remember the game when I was there.
So were the about 100 Finns who cried out to the empty hall of 20,000 spectators.
What would Pehkonen have said 19 years later after the Finnish-Ukraina World Cup game?
In Bilbao, there are eighty times the number of Finnish fans.
The European Championships in 1995 was a search time for Finnish basketball.
Men made their way to the final tournament by winning a Russian qualifying match at the Helsinki Sports Centre, among others.
That victory opened the doors to the cream of Europe.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people like Hanno Möttölä.
Chief coach Henrik Dettmann took Möttölä's lime lines to the final tournament team.
A solution many disagreed with.
Now you can say that Dettmann was wise from a distance, even though everything did not go according to the script.
After Athens, the basketball team dived deep.
At the Athens Games, there were probably just over 100 Finns present.
It included journalists, players' relatives, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
There are journalists, relatives and coaches in Bilbao, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
This phenomenon has grown to incomprehensible proportions.
I don't think anyone can tell me the exact number of Finnish racing tourists.
Estimates have moved between 7 500 and 10 000.
Whatever the number there is, it's an incomprehensible number.
Here's some explaining to sports sociologists.
In the global world economy, companies are moving across borders.
There is still an opportunity in sport to look at how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can visit to see how our girls and boys succeed in the world," says Hannu Itkonen, Professor of Sports Sociology.
Surely there are Finns in both Spain and the volleyball World Cup in Poland who are looking for an experience.
Shared experience.
But that doesn't explain everything.
You've got to be attracted to sports yourself.
Itkonen places sport in popular culture.
There is a lower threshold to go to sports games than Berlin to see art.
But without success, you can't move the masses.
Let's go back to 1995.
Then Chief Coach Dettmann challenged the basketball league and even players to throw themselves into top-notch sports professionally.
Almost ten years passed.
Then the direction changed and the national team was raised to a pedestal.
The volleyball people made the same move a little earlier.
Now both enjoy the fruits of the work.
As Itkonen says, both species have managed to produce their top-notch sports, where the sacred trinity works: sports media sponsors.
Then the audience will also be interested.
And the media have taught us what this kind of carnival support is, Itkonen reminds us.
Can ball sports also transfer this massive interest to their home series?
On average, there are hundreds or just over 1,000 spectators playing in basketball and volleyball.
Itkonen considers the question to be good and does not necessarily provide an answer that would promise very good species.
Another school believes that interest is shifting.
The other one is the one who doesn't want the sweets full.
This group is ready for an adventure trip to the World Cup, but in their basic thinking, domestic series are not of double interest.
It's a challenge for the social people in the midst of the rush.
For the Bottas property confirmation - nearly 1.5 hectares from the lake shore
Nastola rewards the format driver Valtteri Bottas with a beach property.
The municipal government unanimously approved the transfer of 1.4 hectares at its meeting on Monday.
In the future, the property will have a free-time residence.
In Nastola, the success of Bottas has been monitored since his karting days.
He's seen as a good ambassador to market Lahte, the Lahti region and Nastola.
The gift plot is located in Koiskola, on the shore of Kärkjärvi.
It has come under the ownership of the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate transaction.
There are seven demolition buildings in the area, from which the municipality will disassemble six at the expense by the end of this year.
Bottas won formula 1 in Belgium this year.
He's fifth in the World Cup.
Bottas is a native of Nastola and lived in Villähde for his childhood.
He lives in England now, but he goes to Nastola whenever he's free from formulas.
Bottas has visited secondary schools and youth facilities.
Design-smart clothes come but hardly for the poor.
It is currently presenting and testing them at the U.S. Open tennis contest in New York.
Ralph Lauren's smart shirts are tested by ball people in the field, but also by the amateur Marcus Giron, one of the top college players.
According to him, the shirt helps him to follow his own development and regulate his recovery.
A pair of silver sensors have been woven into the nylon shirt, from which the information is transmitted to the mop on the shirt and from there to the smartphone or tablet computer.
Sensors measure heart rate, respiratory rhythm, stress and steps.
Before the shirt is thrown into the washing machine, the mokkula, which acts as a central unit, is removed.
The fashion house has not given us an exact time to start selling the shirt, nor even hinted at its price, Tech Times reports.
Raph Lauren is not the only company that invests in smart clothes.
Athos of California has brought out a smart shirt and smart shorts.
They measure heart rate, breathing, and muscle work.
The clothes cost $100 apiece and the central unit the size of their thumbs costs $200.
The technology was also written by Red Orbit.
Smart way to save in textbooks
The cost of university books in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so Matt Schroeder, who is about to start his second year of study, soon came up with a smart way to save on costs.
He developed a system where later class students borrow their books for nominal remuneration instead of selling the books right away.
"My book of mathematics would normally have cost $180; I paid $10 for its use for the whole semester and a big sandwich," says 19-year-old Schroeder, who is studying at Covenant College in the state of Georgia.
Schroeder says that his books from last semester would normally have cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the university board, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many ways of reducing these costs.
Students increasingly end up using online shops and creative approaches such as Schroeder's idea.
More and more students rent textbooks so that they can use the book throughout the semester and pay well less for it than the students who buy the book.
According to Neebo Inc, over 250 campus book stores, the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Statistics on the sector reveal that about a quarter of the books of university bookstores in the past spring were rental books," says Trevor Meyer, President of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus bookstores.
Here are the simplest ways to save money.
Online stores
In online stores, a new book can only be obtained for a third of the price it would cost at the campus bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler's "Calculus" book is almost $290, but from a specialist book shop on Chegg.com the book will receive $239.99.
Buy Used
The books used are a good option if the reader is not disturbed by the other notes and worn appearance.
For example, the book "Calculus" can be used from Chegg.com online for $93.49.
The last year student at Brigham Young University Matt Casaday, 25 years old, reports that he has purchased the book "Strategic Media Desions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" used only for $0.42 from the Amazon.com online store.
The new book would have cost $48.
Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls School, and other academics recommend that students ask their professors whether previous editions can be used in the course.
Sometimes the reform of the new edition is not relevant to teaching.
In this case, the old edition can only be found at a fraction of the price that should be paid for the new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Renting
You should consider renting your textbooks if you take good care of them, remember to return them and do not need them after completing your course.
By renting, you can save more than 80 percent of the price of the new book.
For example, renting the "Calculus" book for the whole semester costs about $20.
Check out the rules of the renting company, such as notes, payments resulting from the use and wear of the highlight pen.
Renter, be careful: if you forget to return the book, the late payment may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-books
The acquisition of e-books instead of ordinary paper can also be a question.
These books are sometimes rented out to the holder of the e-book, e.g. Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
In Chegg's store, you can get the "Calculus" book as an e-book for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, many students in literature save the most because many classics can now be downloaded for free, while books in science and technology can be very expensive.
It pays to compare different sellers, which option they choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who is about to begin Pepperdine's law school, recommends using the book ISBN number to determine the price, because it can make sure that you are looking for the right book.
Before ordering online, make sure the book is in stock," says Gault.
He himself learned this the hard way.
The book he bought was on ice for four weeks, and he finally had to get the book at full cost at the university bookstore.

Nearly twice the number of people killed in fires compared to last year
This year almost twice as many people have died in fires compared to last year.
According to media monitoring by the Finnish Rescue Agency (Spek), 55 people have already died in 49 different fires in pieces so far.
Last year there were 31 fire deaths in the corresponding period.
The majority of the dead, 36, have been men.
There have been 11 people over 65.
According to the organisation's fire mortality statistics, the last time the situation was worse was in 2009, when 64 people had died in fires by the end of August.
The majority of fire deaths occur in apartments.
There have been 17 fire deaths in blocks of flats, 21 in detached houses and seven in terraced and other small houses.
Spec reminds me of the fire safety review at home.
At least all home fire alarms should be secured.
In addition, everyone should check that the initial fire extinguishing equipment is readily accessible.
All areas of the home must also be an accessible route of escape.
Children should also be told what electrical equipment they can use when they are alone at home.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
The opponents of the NATO Summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the city center of Newport in an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall at the so-called countersummer Summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events this weekend and spoke with protesters who had even arrived from Belgium.
Young people were rescued by air from the Blue Mountains of Australia
TWO teenage hikers were raised to safety after a night stuck in the Blue Mountains in Australia's New South Wales area.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went hiking after noon on Sunday to Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
The relatives were concerned about young people who had not returned home and called the police at eight o'clock at night.
A search party made up of local police officers and helpers was sent to search for young people, and the two were found around 11 p.m. near the Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had injured her knee, and the man had fallen and hit his head.
The police spent the night with a partner, and they were taken to safety on Monday morning.
The hikers were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdrew from Luhansk airport
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Luhansk airport.
According to the Ukrainian army, the soldiers were ordered to retreat.
According to Ukraine, paratroopers have been fiercely involved with Russian tanks in the field.
According to an army representative, the gunfire on the other side has been so accurate that the shooter is likely to be Russian professional soldiers.
In the past 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
In the Asov Sea, a Ukrainian patrol ship that received artillery hits in southeastern Ukraine yesterday sank this morning, says the border guard.
Eight Marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The border patrol didn't know where the ship was fired from.
The Separatists told me yesterday in the social media that they shot the ship.
According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russia will not attack Ukraine.
However, Mr Lavrov insisted that the Ukrainian forces should immediately withdraw to positions from which they cannot fire civilians.
According to the Foreign Minister, there should be an immediate cease-fire without conditions in the Minsk negotiations today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE.
Mr Lavrov also pointed out that Russia would respond to possible new economic sanctions.
Firstly, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions from our partners' actions," Lavrov threatened.
The heavy rains caused the floods in Malmö and Copenhagen
The streets were flooded on Sunday in Malmö and Copenhagen when heavy rains were beating southern Sweden and Denmark.
The floodwaters cut off several roads, mixed traffic and buried cars in their undersides.
On Sunday, authorities estimate that it may take a while to ease the flood, even though it was predicted that the rains would stop by Monday.
The heavy rains came as a surprise to the Swedish authorities, and no weather warning was given in advance about the rains.
The Finnish Meteorologist Ari Mustala, who was on call at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, estimated that the rainfront that affected the area was very local.
The rainy area looks narrow and stationary.
No wonder it's been hard to predict.
French socialists should "be quiet and help France", says Francois Hollande's main supporter
Mr Valls called on the divided left to "show his feelings" towards the socialist president, who was in difficulty, whose composition of the new government did not obtain the approval of the majority of the French people.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our job is to stay by his side," said Valls, and deserved a round of applause.
As a calming gesture, the Prime Minister called on the government to leave France's controversial 35-hour working week alone, despite the proposal made earlier this week by the new Minister for Economic Affairs, Emmanuel Macron, that the rule should be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the socialists to cooperate with the government.
However, the Minister of Justice, Christiane Taubira, caused disunity by appearing at a meeting of the socialist MPs who expressed differences of opinion and by criticising the Socialist Party for allowing 'France to give up hope for the future'.
Marine Le Pen, leader of the extreme right-wing national front, mocked the constant discord between socialists and said that he did not believe that the new regime in Valls would last a few months longer.
Francois Hollande may have gone to war, but so has Manuel Valls, who was obliged to form a new government after the previous one did not last even during the summer.
"And the new government will not last until autumn or winter," Le Pen said to the journalists.
He repeated his party's proposal to disband the parliament and held the election victory of his party in the early elections and he himself would be prepared to lead the party.
The French ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in March's municipal elections and the extreme right held the list tip in May's EU elections.
According to a poll in the Sunday Journal du Dimanche, 76% of French people believe that the Socialist Party may break up into several competing groups before the end of Hollande's season in 2017.
Political researcher Pascal Perrineau of Po University warned that the French would soon lose their patience if the new socialist government did not succeed in improving the economy and record high unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the public must quickly realise that change is about to take place," he warned.
Otherwise, things could get worse.
Pokka betrayed Good morning Finnish hosts Kirsi Alm-Moira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouda failed badly in the recorded part of the program.
Good morning Finland published a fun video of the recordings made on Thursday on its Facebook page last Thursday.
The video hosts Kirsi Alm-Seura and Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouta are trying to record the Finnish advertising puff for the next day's broadcast, but the recording is not going to go quite straight.
Alm-Seira is going crazy when she tries to say the word budget ruckus, and her messing with it also causes Pouda and Rahkola to lose their nerve time and again.
And these heroes should be allowed to broadcast live tomorrow," says the Finnish Facebook update.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been both liked and distributed on Facebook over 10,000 times.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked at the photo office of the magazine, was ranked third in a series of potrets in 1972.
This is Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
In Fredrikinkatu, Helsinki, a meeting of the Socialist International was held at the House of Construction Masters in May 1971.
There were a lot of heads of state at the meeting and the security measures were huge.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went along.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we had more than five minutes to picture.
I took this picture four or five meters away.
The light and background were right.
Right away, I realized I did it this time.
You can see from the look of Meir that the leaders of the Middle East have had a difficult time before.
At that time, the competition was successful with pictures taken of known persons or events.
It is great that you can also succeed with other images today as long as you have an idea and visual torque.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best is Lasse Virén's crash photo of the Munich Olympics.
I didn't send it to the competition.
Dissertation: The Aarnio investigation already cost more than EUR 5 million
The investigation of the legality of the activities of the drugs unit of the Helsinki police has already cost more than EUR 5 million and required 30-50 person-years.
This is how Jyri Rajamäki assessed in her doctoral thesis on information technology at the University of Jyväskylä.
Rajamäki suggests that the enforcement of the lawfulness of police activities and the fight against crime in general could be significantly improved by combining the IT systems of investigation and legal proceedings.
According to Rajamäki, modern technology enables multiple use of forensic material.
He states that it is possible to build a system whereby the data collected to investigate a crime is automatically electronic evidence that fills a chain of evidence and at the same time allows for comprehensive law enforcement.
The doctoral dissertation will be examined on Saturday.
Yle: The 1999 concept of vegetarian food was forgotten on the school wall: "Fish and chicken dishes belonging to the vegetable diet"
A photo of a special bulletin on the wall of the Pirkkala Women's Trip School caused food noise in social media," says Yle on her website.
Vegetarians!
Fish and chicken dishes belonging to the vegetarian diet at school lunch.
Only when there is meat on the list will we prepare a vegetable alternative!
This is stated in a 15 - year - old bulletin that has been forgotten on the school wall.
You can take a look here.
The image spread in social media has led people to send the Pirkkala municipality indignant feedback.
Arja Vaarma, Head of Food and Cleaning Service, says to Yle that the note that was left on the wall is not true and should have been removed a long time ago.
Apparently, before I came here, there has been a thought of this kind that has been discussed with health care in its time.
Every student gets the meal he wants," he says to Yle.
Today, students in Pirkkala schools are offered a vegetarian food option only with the permission of parents and a certificate from a doctor or nurse on a vegetarian diet.
The danger justifies the solution to Yle by the fact that young people's vegetarian experiments may leave their diet inadequate and the absence of meat or chicken may be surprising to the parents of the students.
Norwegian Cruise close to the $3 billion Prestige Cruise deal
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd, the world's third-largest cruise company, is negotiating to buy its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for $3 billion.
The transaction would allow Norwegian Cruise, with a market value of $6.8 billion, to have access to the luxury cruisers and wealthy customers of Prestige Cruises as it continues to compete against Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
Sources suggest that information on a possible agreement may be published this week, although it is also possible that negotiations will not produce results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 % of Norwegian Cruise.
Sources did not want their names in the public domain because there is no public consultation.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not reply to the comments and Apollo's representative refused to comment.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, has 13 cruise ships with a route map covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its turnover grew by 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013, when turnover was $2.57 billion.
The Prestige Cruises, which also operates from Miami, sails under the Oceanian and Regent brand names, comprising a total of eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was USD 1.2 billion, which is six per cent more than in the year before.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit in the coming years from the rise of the emerging economies, such as the Chinese and Indian middle classes.
Companies compete to become the first choice for these new customers when they choose a cruise.
Prestige Cruises registered its first issue of shares on the US stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company's shares since the 2007 deal, worth $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded with its current composition in 2000 after its merger with Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) cruise company. The latter is Lim Kok Thay's entertainment and casino company, a Malaysian billionaire.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the information published, Genting's share of the company was 28 %, Apollo's 20 % and the private equity investment company TPG Capital LP 8 % from the end of June.
The combined share of Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise is 82% of the cruise capacity in North America, as shown in the Registration Document published by Prestige Cruise on the issue of shares.
The City Council of Tampere is discussing the matter today.
Animalia hopes that the city government will support the initiative firmly.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, Executive Director of Animalia, who is preparing her doctoral thesis for the University of Tampere, the time of dolphins in Finland and around the world needs to end quickly.
Fortunately, in recent years, there has been a general view around the world that developing mammals such as dolphins in dolphins are not sustainable either in animal welfare or ethical terms.
This view should also be borne by Tampere.
The abolition of the Delfinaario is not only a question of animal rights, but also a question of Tampere's image as a tourist destination," Tuomivaara points out.
The death of Nasi-Delphine, according to the risk of death, reinforces the requirements for the cessation of dolphin activity.
The death of the sight is a sad continuation of the dark history of the Dolphinarium of Särkanniemi.
It is time to put a stop to the deaths, to close the dolphin prison and to find out how to transfer the Tampere dolphins to a bordered sea area, a kind of dolphin shelter, Tuomivaara insists.
You did not have time to return to the original habitat of the dolphins, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in the Särkanniemi will have time to experience more life than an unstimulated concrete pool," Tuomivaara hopes.
The Animal Welfare Association Animalia aims to ban the use of all wild species in circuses in the overall reform of the Animal Welfare Act under preparation.
This includes dolphins.
In support of this request, Animalia's Executive Director Tuomivaara is taking part in the demonstration on behalf of dolphins held today on 1 September.
The Japanese Embassy in Helsinki takes a stand against the dolphin hunting season starting in Japan.
During the hunting season, some 2,300 dolphins are brutally imprisoned or killed each year, either for the use of dolphins or for food.
Putin calls on Kiev to open negotiations with East Ukraine on a new state
On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted that the Ukrainian Government stop fighting separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "state" status of the outgoing region, Russia's news sources report.
His representative Dmitry Peskov later clarified that Putin did not mean that the region of eastern Ukraine, which was ruled by the separatists, would become part of Russia, but that its role within Ukraine would need to be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking population the power to defend their own rights and interests.
Putin's request to the Kiev Government to negotiate with Russian-minded rebels as equal negotiating partners is in line with his obvious strategy since the violence began five years ago: he is trying to help separatists take over the region and thus force the Ukrainian Government to effectively grant the newly declared Novorossija independence, which will allow it to head for Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the State Channel 1 TV channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian army's attempts to regain the Separatist-controlled eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region, which was taken over by the separatists in March and April following Moscow's annexation of the Ukrainian Crimean Peninsula on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the Separatists have recently baptized the region into "The Novorist", "The New Russia" – a term similar to the days of splendor that preceded the revolutions of the Russian Great Power.
According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said that the planned peace talks are "an illusion" as long as Ukrainian politicians campaign for the parliamentary elections on 26 October and government forces attack civilians in separatist-controlled areas.
"We must immediately start extensive negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the organisation of society and the status of South-East Ukraine, taking into account the interests of the people living there," he says.
According to Peskov, Putin's reference to "statehood" is related to a broader independence which has been discussed for months with the Kiev leadership in its efforts to dispel the fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian Government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need," says Peskov.
This issue cannot be discussed between Ukraine and Russia," says Peskov, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict within Ukraine".
The interim remark by the Kremlin representative, which was intended to correct the 'false interpretation' of Putin's comments, stressed that the Russian regime dealt with the separatist rebellion in the eastern regions differently from that of Crimea, which, in practice, took over an area where the majority of the population of 2 million people is ethnically Russian.
Moscow would be much more difficult to integrate even the Donetsk or Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, because most of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russian and, according to pre-conflict polls, the majority of the population supported staying in Ukraine.
The independence that Russian diplomats have discussed in international fora would give Ukrainian local governments the right to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give the Kremlin virtually power in an area that links Russia to Crimea.
On the Black Sea Peninsula, which was annexed to Russia five months ago, Russia's main fleet, commercial shipping ports and historical coastal sites are located.
The Russian region between Rostov and Crimea also includes mines, factories and metal smelters that produce products vital to the Russian army.
On 7 June, in his inaugural address, President Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine proposed that Ukrainian legislators – after the new elections – consider constitutional changes in order to increase the decision-making power of the regions that are different from the Ukrainian core area in their own economy and the status of languages.
However, his vision of independence seems to differ sharply from that of the separatists, perhaps armed and fuelled by the Kremlin and Moscow.
Putin made his latest request to the Kiev Government to negotiate with Russian-minded rebels as equal partners after the rebels made further progress last week after Russian tanks and troops invaded Eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area on the Azov coast.
The Ukrainian security authorities fear that the taking over of the city of Novoazovsky by the separatists supported by Russia is the beginning of a greater effort to take over the entire strategically important coastal area up to Crimea.
It has led to the massive strengthening of Mariupol city by civilians and military personnel. Mariupol, a half million inhabitants, is known as a steel-producing port city between Novoazovsky and the narrow land area leading to the Crimean peninsula.
On Saturday, Mr Poroshenko spoke to the leaders of the European Union in Brussels asking for further measures to prevent future violations of Russia in Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We're about to reach a point where there's no turning back," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not take any direct action decisions; the leaders proposed further sanctions to allow them to be introduced if the crisis in Ukraine flares up again in unclear circumstances.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in the area of Ilovaisk following the transfer of two Russian armored divisions and 1 000 soldiers to the Donetsk region last week in order to strengthen the separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, a representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told journalists in Kiev on Saturday.
According to Lysenko, the first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers surrounded by Russia in Ilovaisk was replaced by 10 Russian parachute jumpers who were imprisoned in the territory of Ukraine a week ago.
Milan's opening goal was scored by the Japanese artist Keisuke Honda in the seventh minute of the game.
At the second half, Sulley Muntar was first hit and a little later Jeremy Menez was hit by a penalty kick.
Lazio, too, got a turn-down at the end of the game, but Diego Lopez, the goalkeeper, rejected Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez moved to Milan for this season from Real Madrid.
Milan's former attacker icon in Inzagh's coaching debut, San Siro Stadium was only half way round.
The audience was announced at 39,000 admissions.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko in the whirlwind of the naked image scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he is outraged by hackers who may have stolen his fiancée and Hollywood A-lister Gabi Grecko's naked pictures.
In the entertainment world, a number of Jennifer Lawrence's naked pictures were released on the Internet as a result of a wide-ranging celebrity hacking scandal.
The hacker has been said to have a total of 60 naked pictures of Hunger Star Lawrence and other superstars, such as the top model Kate Upton and Cara Delovingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actor Kirsten Dunst.
Also pictures of Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovsky and Grecko in Melbourne have apparently been stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko last month, said to Confident, "This is disgusting."
All personal contacts and images should remain private.
It is a disgrace that private information can be stolen and disseminated.
Greckon, who is in New York, reported commenting on the case in an online magazine "excruciatingly" and saying that the victims "feel disgraced".
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with his last boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of Palmer at the topless pool edge.
Palmer's films include the film Love and Honor with the co-star Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck series star Strahovsky and Sucker Punch actor Browning didn't comment on the hacked photos last night.
