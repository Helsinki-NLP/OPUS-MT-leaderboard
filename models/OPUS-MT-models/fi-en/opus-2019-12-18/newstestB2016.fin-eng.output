Found a 9-year-old boy on the run from Tampere.
The police have had a search mission due to the runaway of a 9-year-old boy in Tampere on Tuesday evening.
A missing persons report on a boy who left West Tampere with his friend has spread in social media.
According to the police station, the boy has been contacted and is not at risk of life and health.
The boy's father told the Night-Sayers at midnight that he was found.
He's okay, and now we're gonna start a follow-up.
The boy was found in the neighborhood of the home, my father told me.
Ronaldo, on the other hand, was ripping the paint difference to Messi.
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league this weekend and continued his production in the Champions League.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo over the goal kingship of the Champions League turned at least for a moment in favor of the latter.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo took the lead in all-time scorer statistics when he shot a visitor to Shahtar Donetsk's network with two hits on the penalty kicks and one on the game situation.
Ronaldo raised his score to 80 when the Barcelona Messi, which was evenly read with him before Tuesday, had 77 hits.
Real won the match 4-0.
Juventus has stumbled in the Italian football league Serie A during the early season, but in the Champions League's D-section, he began with a strong 2-1 victory in Manchester City.
Over ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata made the victory.
City's attack was dulled by the absence of Sergei Aguero, a knee-disrupting man.
In the weekend's Championship, Aguero didn't come to the airport until the last ten minutes.
In the Netherlands, Manchester's second club, United, was also hit hard by PSV Endhoven after having suffered a 1-2 loss.
Luke Shaw, a 20-year-old champion of ManU, only lasted 15 minutes.
PSV's dangerous-looking slider, Hector Moreno, hit the target's attacking ManU pack so badly that Shaw probably broke his tibia.
Shaw lay on the lawn of Eindhoven's home stadium ten minutes before medical personnel left to transport him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests 41 minutes to the 1-0 lead, but ManU's pleasure lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno evened out before the break in time.
During the second half of the time, the winning goal of PSV was made by Luciano Narsingh.
The season of painting in the Champions League began with the "A" section of Paris Saint-Germain.
It was an Argentinean Angel Di Maria who changed his shirt to a PSG.
Di Maria broke through right and lifted the ball past the corner of Malmö's goalie Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani did 2 to 0 for the PSG for the second half.
PSG's been betting on the season's success group.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of the league's small clubs, is not the best possible benchmark.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the star attacker of the PSG, met Malmö FF for the first time in his professional career.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played for 90 minutes when his team in Moscow, the Czech Republic, lost in the B-block match in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party demanded immediate resignation - the president gave the wrong speech
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has given the same speech again in the country's parliament at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether Mr Mugabe, who was 91 years old, is still alive.
The main opposition party, the MDC, called for Mugabe to resign because he is too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants hurried to say that the confusion had taken place solely in Mugabe's headquarters and that the President had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech dealt with earlier and now China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an extraordinary summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an additional summit of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
The request was evaluated by Donald Tusk, President of the European Council leading the summits.
According to the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to better register futures in Europe.
The negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are, according to Merkel, at the table of the Ministers of the Interior.
Professor admits he shot his girlfriend in an emergency call.
University professor Shannon Lamb asked for a voice in the 911 call, shaking the police a little bit at his house, telling him he shot his girlfriend.
Lamb specifically mentioned that their beloved dog was present and alive and probably scared. Professor told me that the contact details of the dead woman's family would be on her phone.
Inside the house the police found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten message written on white paper: "I am very sorry and I wish I could cancel what I did. I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me," the letter that Lamb signed said according to the authorities.
There was no sign that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already travelled 500 kilometers to the school campus. The police found Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history who was considered dead at the door of his study, who is believed to have been shot by Lambin.
Lynn Buford, police chief at Delta State University, noted that the university authorities were informed of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
According to him, Lamb made a fatal 911 call some time after this.
There was still one more death in the day, and Lamb took his own life when the police reached him.
The following day, students and teaching staff kept behind locked doors, and the authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb's motive.
Researchers examined the details in both places, and the teachers who knew Lamb told us about the man, who created a picture of a talented but perhaps troubled teacher.
Students always said they were looking forward to the professor's classes.
According to Prentiss County Gautier police, the professor had no prior history of violence or crime.
Schmidt, for his part, had mentioned in a book written by Lamb, where he had acknowledged "beautiful people" with whom he was allowed to live academically.
Both worked at the Department of Social Sciences and History with 17 teaching staff, many of whom attended courses for both men.
However, there were indications of problems.
Brandon Beavers, a student of Lambia's, said that the professor seemed agitated and nervous, "like something's wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told him at the end of 2014-2015 that he was under stress.
Lamb had previously applied to Delta State University for sick leave because of some health problem.
This year he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in university salary policy meant that a doctoral dissertation for which Lamb had worked hard would not automatically guarantee him assistant professorship.
William LaForge, headmaster of the university, said that he was not aware of the conflicts between Lamb and Schmidt, but he said that there was clearly something wrong with Lambia.
These are the questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After leaving campus, the police found out what route Lamb had taken from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before the police reached Lamb, he had taken his own life with a 38-gauge pistol in the backyard of the house in Greenville, Mississippi, about a mile from his parents' home, reported Washington County coroner Methel Johnson.
Lamb's car was still running in the driveway.
The police didn't immediately find out why Lamb had gone to this very house, but Johnson told me that he believed that he knew the people of the house.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb started work as a teacher in geography and education at a university with 3 500 students. The city had 12 000 inhabitants in 2009 .
He got a doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's longest friends described this as intelligent, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston told me she met Lamb through mutual friends when she was herself 15 and Lamb 20 years old.
He and his friends were still in high school, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who spent years trying to teach Hairston guitar.
"Lamb was quite a heartbreaker back then.
All the girls were pissed at him," said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Jackson's suburbs in Brandon.
Looks like Lamb and Prentiss had been seeing each other for a while.
On the 911 call, Lamb told me he killed his wife, but there's no record of them being married.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, and they lived in a brick house in a river estuary in the small town of Gautier.
The police said the dog was okay.
Prentiss' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen told me he broke up with Prentiss 15 years ago.
"She was totally upset," O'Steen said about her daughter.
"Daughter and mother were best friends."
O'Steen hadn't met Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb liked music and played the blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail both performed at the summer event three years ago.
Later, they also played together at times.
According to O'Steen, his daughter composes and plays her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies online.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and part-time entertainment coordinator at the humble restaurant The Julep Room outside Gautier, reported seeing Lamb and Prentiss on September 5, after Lamb played guitar and harmonica for a few audiences.
There was nothing to say that something was wrong.
"Happy couple," Shaffer said.
"We joked together.
They both had a good sense of humor."
"Professor Schmidt, who was killed, directed the seminars for the first year and specialized in Indian and colonial history," said Professor Don Allan Mitchell.
She was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his own fraternity and student union.
There are 900 people gathered at Delta State University campus in Cleveland for a memorial event in candlelight, including teaching staff, other staff, students and residents of the region.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and Brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a night event where the university choir performed "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The lesson will continue on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get the students back," LaForge said.
"The crisis is over.
This is a healing day."

Assistant editors: Associated Press editors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The case has been corrected because the police are now telling us that Lamb made a 911 call after Schmidt was shot, and it was also clarified that even though Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife in the 911 call, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us does not intend to hire as many seasonal workers as last year. However, the dealer of toys and baby products says that he is offering his current employees and seasonal workers the opportunity to work extra hours.
The company intends to hire 40 000 people in stores and distribution centres across the country, and in 2014 it hired 45 000 seasonal workers.
Most jobs are part-time.
The interviews with applicants will start this month, and new employees will start in October-December.
Although the holiday season is still months away, the trade season is approaching well, and companies are preparing by hiring temporary workers for shops and the delivery and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his "date" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of Michael J. Fox's career was an important moment for the future.
The premiere also had a personal meaning.
"We sat in the theater and waited for the royals to arrive. I noticed that there was an empty place next to me. It dawned to me that Princess Diana was coming next to me," Fox said on the trailer of the Back in Time documentary.
"When the movie started, I realized it was a lot like a date with the Princess of Wales."
Back in Time is related to Back to the Future, and in addition to Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd are interviewed, as well as director Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg.
The film "Back to the Future" got its premiere 30 years ago.
"This film is definitely a time travel film for me," Spielberg said.
Back in Time will be published in VOD and DVD format and will be shown in selected cinemas from October onwards.
UN Secretary-General: No military solution in Syria
The UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon commented on Russia's intensified military efforts and stated that there was no military solution to the nearly five-year conflict and that weapons only bring more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The Secretary-General again urged all parties involved, including the split UN Security Council, to join forces and support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
At a press conference held on Wednesday, Ban announced his intention to meet five permanent members of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, Great Britain and France, to discuss the situation in Syria, which would coincide with the UN General Assembly's ministerial week later this month.
He regretted the fact that the disintegration of the Security Council, the Syrian people and the regional powers has led to a situation which is impossible to resolve.
In the context of the Syrian crisis, Ban urged five permanent Member States to show the same solidarity and unity that reached the Iranian nuclear agreement.
8 chapters on support polls: Is Donald Trump serious?
They've been trying to label Trump an empty talker.
They also thought he was a joke.
Some of them are predicting a collapse for Trump.
The Republican circles have (so far) made every effort to pull Trump down from the gallup cord.
Ten out of eleven national polls show Donald Trump two figures of support. Some already seriously consider what it says in practice about the possibility of running for a real estate mogul.
But the election is only in its early stages.
There's been no announcement that Trump will be nominated as a Republican candidate.
Experts recall that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry, who was at the polls, was allowed to give space to the rising Herman Cain. Neither of them finally won the candidate election in any state.
There are many reasons why Trump would have a difficult time in the general election.
External groups, such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Grouping Club for Growth, have taken note of Trump's strong position and have begun to dig their holes to bring him down.
The following recent gallup data show that the real estate mogul cannot be ignored by a stalking:
There's been a reversal of Trump's support.
Just before Trump announced that he would run in mid-June, according to the Monmouth University poll, only two out of ten Republicans had a positive image of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, 40 percent had a positive impression.
At the beginning of August, the corresponding proportion was 52 per cent.
Now six out of ten Republicans have a positive image of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten images are negative.
These figures are also held in states where elections are first held.
Last week at the Quinnipiac poll, 60% of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two thirds of the Republicans would be pleased with Trump's nomination.
In the CNN/ORC poll last week, 67% of Republicans said that they were very satisfied or satisfied with Trump's possible election as a candidate.
Only two out of ten would be very unhappy with Trump's nomination.
Ben Carson is almost as enthusiastic as Trump (43 percent would be very happy with Carson's nomination and 40 percent with Trump's nomination).
Who's the next most popular candidate?
The third is Marco Rubio, which has a 21% participation rate.
On the other hand, 47% of Republicans would be unhappy or very unhappy if Jeb Bush were elected as a candidate for the party.
Most Republicans don't think Trump's temperament is problematic.
Donald Trump has been widely criticized for pomp and insulting comments. 52% of Republican supporters throughout the country consider the properties of the real estate mogul to be suitable for the president. The views are reflected in an opinion poll by ABC News and Washington Post.
The same figure applies to Iowa, where the first party meeting is held: according to the Quinnipiac poll, 52% of Republicans consider Trump's personal qualities to be appropriate for the Chief of Defence.
However, according to the ABC and Post poll, 44% believe that Trump is unable to function effectively and six out of ten consider Trump's temperament inappropriate for the White House.
Republicans are getting used to it.
They're starting to take Trump seriously.
When the Republicans are asked who is most likely to be nominated for the party, according to CNN and ORC poll, four out of ten believe in Trump's chances.
The situation has changed since mid-July, when four out of ten would have put their money on Jeb Bush's behalf.
Overall: Republicans have never had a very reliable crystal ball at their disposal before.
At this point in the last election, four out of ten Republicans considered Rick Perry a likely candidate, and only 28% of Mitt Romney.
The majority seem to find Trump's campaign convincing.
Even if the Republicans support the other candidate, Trump defeats almost all the other candidates.
Some experts believe that a divided camp is likely to benefit Trump when the opponents of Trump are divided into different candidates.
Monmouth University's opinion poll at the beginning of September revealed that in the imaginary duel between Trump and almost any other Republican candidate, Trump would almost always win a larger support force.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and Rand Paul by John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's even with Ted Cruz.
Is Cruz Trump's only real opponent?
Ben Carson would win Trump with a 19-point difference in fictional duel.
A small majority of Trump's supporters say that they have already taken a vote.
According to a poll published by CBS and NOW on Tuesday, more than half of Trump's supporters are certain of their voting decision.
Of course, the situation can change for a number of reasons, and at the moment a certain electorate can change its mind.
46% of Trump's supporters have not taken a final decision.
Trump's biggest competitor at the moment is neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who have already chosen their candidates are twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans share Trump's view of immigration.
In his campaign speech, Donald Trump invited immigrants from Mexico two months ago to become rapists, migration has been a hot topic in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's pompous speeches will banish important Latin American voters from the Republican forces and hinder the renewal of the brand.
However, according to the polls published on Monday by ABC News and Washington Post, six out of ten Republicans are in line with Trump on migration issues.
As long as immigration is in the spotlight, so is Donald Trump.
Dissatisfaction with the regime is at its peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are currently collecting about half of the Republican votes.
According to the latest polls by ABC News and Washington Post, six out of ten Republicans felt this way.
These two candidates are also pissed off at Washington.
According to an opinion poll by Des Moines Register and Bloomberg in Iowa, three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Republican activities in Congress: 54% are dissatisfied and 21% are on the verge of rage."
Jeremy Corby's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time
Since the election, Corbyn's first appearance at Prime Minister's Question Time has been eagerly awaited.
Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party Labour's new figurehead, is due to rise for the first time to reflect his strength at David Cameron's Question Time later.
Corbyn presents the first of his six questions shortly after noon, with the media and Labour representatives following him with a hard eye.
Corby's been calling for less theater and more facts for the weekly show.
He has also stated that he can miss some of the sessions and leave them to his colleagues.
At the meeting, Corbyn's leadership will be weighed up for the first time in contact. Corby will now be subjected to a parliamentary test after the assembly of the shadow government and the speech of the Corbyn Confederation of Trade Unions (TUC) at its annual meeting on Tuesday.
The decision of the Labour Party to remain silent during the 75th anniversary of the British Air War held during the National Anthem on Tuesday has been criticised by several representatives of the Tory Party, and the silence has also ended up in the headlines on the front page of several newspapers.
Corbyn's silence during the national anthem attracted attention.
Corbyn's representative said that Corbyn stood during the national anthem with silent respect for the heroicness of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain.
However, Owen Smith, member of Corbyn's shadow board, told the BBC in Two's Newsnight that he would have urged the leader of the party to join the national anthem despite the opposition of this monarchy.
A dozen shadow ministers have refused to join Corbyn's number one team, arguing for differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs. Less than one sixth of the party originally supported Corbyn's election to the party leadership.
Robin Brant, BBC policy correspondent, believes that political disagreements about British membership of the EU and the conditions for granting benefits tightened by the government have accumulated in the Labour Party since the appointment of Corbyn.
Corbyn said at the UCC meeting that Labour was going to propose changes to remove the restrictions altogether.
Hours later, Mr Smith, Minister for Labour and Pensions of the shadow government, said that the party's position was very clear: it was only against the government's plans to reduce the limit from 26 000 to 23 000 pounds.
Corbyn is the fifth Labour leader that David Cameron faces over the past decade in the lead of the Tory party.
The Labour Director, who promised a new approach to politics, says that he has chosen questions to Mr Cameron about the 30 000 proposals he has received from the public.
According to Mr Corbyn, elected from the constituency of Islington North, Question Time has too many confrontations; he promises to avoid clever words and dirt throwing and says that he will instead focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corby has said that the shadow minister, Angela Eagle, will cover for him during Question Time, for example when Cameron is on a trip abroad.
Mr Corby has also thrown out the idea that others could also be heard from time to time, and he says that he had discussed the matter with John Bercow, President of the House of Commons of Parliament.
Following Corbyn's election in 2005, Cameron said that he wanted a puppetic policy that was often linked to Question Time, but some years later he acknowledged that he had failed in his efforts.
Since Question Time was first televised in 1990, it has been regarded as a key measure of the leadership's judgment, control of the House of Commons and position, but critics say that Question Time has become a caricature that needs major reforms.
"Shot in Joburg": from homeless young people to photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a challenging environment for the homeless.
A meaningful way of learning and earning has been found for a group of former street children.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit film studio where homeless young people are taught to photograph their home and earn at the same time.
The BBC News met a young person who has graduated from the project among the first.

The pound is stronger as Britain's wages rise
The pound was strengthened as wages rose in the UK, and SABMiller drew the FTSE 100 index.
In May to July wages and salaries rose by 2.9 per cent in Great Britain compared with the corresponding period last year. Bonuses were not included.
The faster growth than predicted was the fastest since 2009.
The pound was strengthened by 1% and its price was quoted at USD 1,5505. The pound was also strengthened in relation to the euro and quoted at EUR 1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose by 1,49% and ended up at 6,229.21 points.
The biggest increase was made by SABMiller, whose course pained 20% when the company received a preliminary offer from the competing company AB InBev.
When the transaction took place, two of the world's largest brewing companies would join together and bring brands under the same roof, such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 per cent in the wake of the positive results of the competing Richemont group focusing on luxury products.
Richemont's latest sales figures are better than predicted. The sales development was also driven by a rise in Burberry's key market in China.
Glencore's share rose by 5% after the mining giant announced its intention to raise USD 2.5 billion in the share issue as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The packaging and paper group Mondi's shares were the biggest faller by 4.3 per cent when Goldman Sachs dropped the company's share price for sales purposes.
JD Sports's rate rose by 3.1 per cent after a sports company announced that its pre-tax return would increase by 83% to GBP 46.6 million.
JD Sports boss: higher wage costs could hamper expansion
According to Peter Cowgill, chairman of JD Sports Management Team, raising the minimum wage in the UK would mean increasing purchasing power for potential customers.
However, increased purchasing power is not sufficient to cover higher labour costs for the company.
According to Mr Cowgill, the increase in labour costs could jeopardise JD Sports' expansion plans and reduce the need for additional labour.
Metcash launches a grassroots campaign against Aldi's avalanche
Metcash aims to secure its IGA store from Aldi's claim in South and West Australia.
The food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to maintain the market share of IGA retail stores in South and West Australia against Aldi's $700 million Australian invasion.
Aldi will open two distribution centres and the first up to 120 stores in South and Western Australia at the beginning of next year. Metcast and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build IGA brands through marketing in mainstream media and social media and organise events like Adelaide show.
IGA stores and suppliers as well as many brands are involved in the campaign. For example, the ice cream factory Simmo in Dunsborough offers a taste in IGA stores, and retailers sell tickets to their regulars for games at a discount price for the South Australian Football League.
Metcashi is expected to publish more detailed information on its defence strategy on 29 September, when the wholesale food, alcohol and hardware store will organise an annual investment strategy day.
This is a significant market since South and West Australia account for almost 30% of the footprint of Metcash's IGA stores, and in these areas the net yield is higher than that of the Eastern Länder' IGA store network.
South and West Australian consumers are known for their Cornerness, and IGA traders have a much larger market share in the region than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. In South Australia the market share is 30% and in Western Australia 24%, while in the eastern Länder it is only 14%.
For example, Morgan Stanley analysts believe that Aldi captures 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores. The chain eats sales from all operators, but especially from operators independent of the chains.
This week, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA retailers can sell $360 million and Metcash can sell $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South and Western Australia next year and will reach 500 million dollars and 600 million dollars in these areas.
Metcash's fixed costs are high, so the loss of food sales and volume can mean a loss of $13 million in profit before interest and taxes," says Kierath.
At the same time, Metcast loses market share in the eastern Länder mainly for Ald and Coles, although Roy Morgan's recent study shows that IGA's customers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food sales will fall by 3.8% in 2016, by 4.1 per cent in 2017 and by 2.1 per cent in 2018. Its market share would fall from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% by 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglas, the leading portfolio manager of Magellan Financial Group, told me at the Melbourne event that it was very likely that Metcash would disappear completely within ten years.
Metcash has refused to take a public position on Douglas' comments.
Understandably, a member of Metcash's board contacted Douglas last week.
Since 2010, IGA's market share has fallen from 18% to 14%, while the food business in Metcash, which serves 1200 IGA dealers, has fallen by 43% from 2012 levels, showing a reduction in debt financing as the pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler takes countermeasures and makes an annual investment of more than 150 million Australian dollars to meet the prices of Coles and Woolworths for hundreds of products each week. The chain wants to support retailers in the renewal of stores so that they can increase the supply of fresh products and improve the food mix of their own brands.
According to Metcashi's CEO, Ian Morrice, the price review and store renewal plans are well under way and the company will be able to increase its profits again in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Steve Healy, President of the Australian Tennis Association, defends Thanasi from Kokkinak
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves a special mention of his behavior instead of criticism.
According to Steve Healy, president of the Australian Tennis Association, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a bystander in the recent Nick Kyrgios yuppa. Cokkinakis deserves a special mention instead of criticism.
The younger party to the "Special K" duo, Kokkinakis, was caught in an unfavorable light shine when the bad boy Kyrgios provoked his opponent Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal ATP tournament.
Soon thereafter, in the Kokkinakis-Ryan Harrison qualifying match played in Cincinnati, the judge had to twice separate the rivals. "Wawrinka should have kicked the crap out of Cyrrgios and me," Harrison said.
In the open U.S., Kokkinakis, frustrated at the bat's field, when powerful cramps ruined his fights. Healy has loyally defended Kokkinak.
At the moment, the teen star is in Glasgow, where he and Sam Groth are fighting for the second place behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinal against Great Britain.
"I strongly believe that Thanasi has been drawn into the dispute," Healy said.
"He broke the bat when he lost the match in the open in the United States. He is by no means the first player to break his bat because of frustration. I know Thanas so well that he is not proud of what he did.
However, he has endured very well, for example, Harrison's provocative behavior in the open in the United States, and I think he deserves recognition.
He's got a strong team and a great family around him, and I think he's just been treated a little unfairly.
He's very mature to 19 years old, he works hard and completes the team well. He's never had any problems with other players, and he's respected among players. He's practicing hard, he's in good shape and a very stable and mature young man. I think he should be judged by his own Merites."
Healy also supported the decision to drop Kyrgios from the Australian team from an important tour starting on Friday. Healy describes the solution as a joint decision for all parties involved. However, he supports the return of Canberra's breeder to the long-term confirmation of the team.
"First of all, we want to focus fully on the fights rather than on the politicians associated with the Kyrgios," said Healy.
As Federer and Murray, among other things, have pointed out, the young man has to grow up in the spotlight of public opinion. He deserves the criticism he has received for his bad mistakes. However, we strive to support him so that he can understand the consequences of his actions. We also try to provide him with privacy. I think that's best for both the whole team and Nick."
European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary, which declared an emergency, closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and apprehended illegal immigrants in order to prevent the influx of migrants.
There was chaos at the border when hundreds of immigrants piled up in no-man's country, and the Serbian authorities reacted furiously.
People fleeing violence were forced to stay on the road between checkpoints in the countries for an indefinite period of time.
Frustration began to rise to the surface.
While the police helicopter was flying in the air above the immigrants, they said, "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some started protesting the hunger strike and the drink strike.
The Serbian Foreign Minister stated that it would not accept the return of migrants to Hungary at the same time as more migrants arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not increase the damage.
The situation must be discussed in Brussels and in other countries in the next few days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The drudgery on the border between Hungary and Serbia began a day later when a group of 28 failed to develop a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed, however, that the responsibility for the 40 000 influx of asylum seekers in Italy and Greece was shared, with the hope that agreement would be reached by the end of next month or by the end of the year on which EU Member States would receive 120 000 migrants, including Hungary.
On Tuesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened an extraordinary summit for the next week in order to discuss the continental migration crisis.
However, Hungary did not hope for swift action by Brussels or neighbouring countries.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation developed so that in the two southern regions the authorities were allowed to adopt more effective means of closing down roads and speeding up judicial procedures in the field of asylum.
At the same time, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, stated that Hungary was also planning a barbed wire fence on the Romanian border to prevent the flow of migrants from that direction, now that the Serbian border already has a fence.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners participated in tendering for the completion of barbed wire fences between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear bottleneck for immigrants and a transit point to the European Union, many of which are refugees from Syria and the rest of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban claimed that most of the people arriving are living standards refugees, not war refugees, who have the right to seek protection, and that there are radical differences in the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
Under the new law that came into force at midnight in Hungary, it is a crime to cross or damage a four-metre-high barbed wire fence built by the government on the southern border towards Serbia, and it also defines longer periods of imprisonment for convicted traffickers.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the government is declaring a state of crisis," the government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told journalists in the town of Szeged in the south of the country.
"We are following a strict line: illegal border crossing is a crime."
In practice, Parliament still has to accept the military measures that are expected next week, and journalists from the Associated Press News Office at the border have for several days seen heavily armed soldiers with their vehicles and their military dogs.
Orban's Internal Security Advisor, Gyorgy Baktoni, reported that the authorities have captured 45 people who tried to cross the border immediately at the border and 15 further away.
By damaging the fence, people who cross the border are now in police custody, charged with crimes under new laws.
The authorities will quickly repair the fence.
In addition, two of the seven border crossing points on the Serbian border were closed by the Hungarian authorities on Tuesday; one border crossing was closed by means of a wired train car.
Chaos took over the main border crossing point near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungarians opened a small metal container where people packed in.
About 20 could fit in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main street linking Serbia and Hungary, and people announced that they were on a hunger and drink strike until they were released into Hungary.
2016 elections: Hillary Clinton's management against Bernie Sanders contracted by half according to national poll
The former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's support rate is still double-digit in the race for the Democratic national presidential candidate, but Senator Bernie Sanders has closed the gap.
The support for Clinton now stands at 47% of the votes of Democrats (down from 58%) while Sanders is second with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced his possible departure to the presidential race, with 15% in favour of the democrats.
More than five months before the primary elections, it is too early for most democrats to tell whom candidates they are supporting.
However, Clinton's supporters are more sure of their choice than other candidates.
Since the poll that CBS News made last month, Clinton has lost the support of a number of democratic groups, while Sanders' camp has been joined by new supporters.
Clinton still has a strong lead among women and moderates, but the leadership has narrowed.
Clinton's support for men has fallen significantly and has only a five - percent bow over Sanders.
Clinton has lost leadership among Democrats under 50 and is now even with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a clear advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton's lead in support of Sanders was double-digit among the liberals, but now Sanders has taken five percentage points of the neck to Clinton in this group.
About half of the Democrats will be happy to support Clinton if he is elected as a party candidate.
A quarter would support Clinton with little reservations, and 15% would only support him because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support Clinton.
It is no surprise that Clinton's current supporters would also be particularly enthusiastic if he was elected as a candidate.
There is more disintegration among those who currently do not support Clinton. Only about a quarter would support him enthusiastically.
Forty-eight per cent of democratic voters would support Clinton, while only 35 per cent of Republican voters would enthusiastically support the most popular Republican candidate, Donald Trump.
When Clinton's voters are asked to freely describe why they support his nomination, the most popular argument is Clinton's right experience (16%). The second most popular answer is that it is time to choose a female president (13%), and third, that Clinton is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
There is also mention of a common view and the possibility of winning the actual elections.
The vice president was still considering his possible nomination, and 57% of the democratic voters would like him to join the race, but a third would prefer to leave him out of the race.
When the second most popular candidate for the party is inquired of democratic voters, the majority choose Biden.
Of Clinton's supporters, over half of Biden is the second most popular candidate after Clinton and much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden doesn't go to the Democratic candidate race, Hillary Clinton will increase his head start with Sanders. With Sanders, the lead is 20 percentage points and it will increase to 30 percentage points if Sanders doesn't go to the race.
55% of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning the actual elections, but the proportion has fallen from 78% last month.
Biden, second in line, is a long way from Clinton, but more and more people believe in Biden's chances of winning the actual election.
However, democratic voters consider the views on the issues to be more important than the candidates' chances of winning.
The electorate does not consider it unacceptable for democratic candidates or potential candidates.
Voters consider candidates for democracy or potential candidates to be appropriate in terms of their characteristics.
Most people think Clinton, Sanders and Biden are honest, trustworthy, and leader types.
Biden is most often described as being honest, while Clinton is most often regarded as the type of leader.
As many as 30 per cent of democratic voters do not think Clinton is honest and reliable, while 15 per cent of Sanders do not know if Sanders is honest.
Democratic voters feel that Clinton, Sanders and Biden's views are close to the electorate's own ideology.
For all properties, about a quarter of them have no opinion of Sanders.
When the voters are asked for views on the use of Hillary Clinton's private e-mail and its own server as Secretary of State, most of the Democrats express their satisfaction with Clinton's explanation and have not changed their perception of Clinton.
The Americans disagree more widely.
Half the Americans are unhappy with Clinton's investigation, and only one third are satisfied.
The public's opinions were divided in March when the conflict had just come out.
The majority of Americans believe that the use of controversial e-mails has not affected their overall picture of Clinton. 36% say that the image has changed in a negative direction.
Of this 36%, the majority, six out of ten, are Republicans.
Although the voters of their own party feel that Clinton is honest and reliable, there is room for improvement in these qualities when all voters are asked for their views: Clinton considers that only 32% is honest and reliable, which is 8 percentage points less than last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
62% of all voters do not think Clinton is honest and reliable.
On the other hand, 55% of all voters across the country do not think Trump is honest and reliable either.
However, both Clinton and Trump get good grades for leadership.
Of the six candidates surveyed, Biden, Carson and Bush were considered the most reliable.
Most people think Sanders is honest, but like Carson, many people don't have an opinion about Sanders.
The survey sample is 351 voters and the margin of error of the survey is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is catching up with Donald Trump's head start in the National Support Survey.
According to CBS News and New York Times' latest poll, Ben Carson has reached Donald Trump.
These two candidates grabbed more than half the votes in the new poll and left the other candidates far behind.
Trump still has strong support among Republican voters throughout the country. The share of support has risen from 23% of the CBS survey commissioned before the debate held last month in Fox News. According to the survey published on Tuesday, 27%.
However, Carson's support would result in a massive increase in the same period, from 6% to 23%.
According to the survey, Carson has strong support in all population groups, and in the higher education group, he's close to defeating Trump.
The other candidates, except Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, remain far behind. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support is weakest and has fallen from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, split the third place with a 6% support.
The error margin for a sample of 376 Republican voters is 6% per cent in one direction or another. The survey was conducted in September.
According to the latest questionnaire published last week by CNN and ORC, Carson's support is rising, and she is supported by 19% of Republicans with 32% of Trump's support.
In the latest poll by ABC News and Washington Post, Trump was also ahead of Carson.
At the men's meeting last week, Trump launched false accusations against a retired neurosurgeon, but Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said during his campaign in Iowa on Saturday.
Five fraternity members charged with the death of Baruch College freshman.
Nearly two years ago, after the death of a student in a ritual in the Poconovies of Pennsylvania, five people are charged with murder.
The members of the Baruch College (City University of New York) Pi Delta Ps were brutally assaulted at the baptism of Chun "Michael" Deng in September 2013. According to the police, they did not deliver Deng to the hospital in time, which was considered to have contributed to his death.
According to the authorities, the victim's eyes were tied, his back had a backpack filled with sand of nearly 15 kilos, and he had been repeatedly attacked in an attempt to reach an object located across the frozen field.
Deng is reported to have complained of headaches and then lost consciousness.
According to the police, the members of Pi Delta Ps' fraternity didn't call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, and they say they waited an hour before they took Deng to the hospital.
Commissioner Chris Wabner told me at the press conference that the members had time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms and contact the section president Andy Meng.
"At this point, members began hiding equipment, putting the interests of the fraternity ahead of Michael Deng's health," said Wagner.
Deng could not be revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng had been hit several times on the head, torso and thighs with blunt object.
"Too many families have been shocked by the hazing of the fraternity, as at least one student a year has died as a result of the hazing since 1970," says Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
Shareholders and their members must be held accountable, where authorities must take an important step.
The grand jury in Monroe County charged five members of the fraternity with the murder of a third degree.
In addition, 32 members of the fraternity are charged with hazing and criminal conspiracy, including Meng.
"We want to be held accountable not only for individuals, but also for the organisation that officially or informally accepted the hazing," Wagner told at the press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College imposed an operating ban on the holding, and the national holding resigned from the local branch.
This is the effect of raising interest rates on the Federal Reserve (Fedin)
Raising interest rates and the upturn in the stock market are faltering, securities are rising and the economy is sliding into recession.
That's what we know.
On the other hand, we do not know how long everything will take and how long the effects will last.
In economic terms in particular, we find an indication of timing in history.
The recession has come up to 11 months after the first increase in interest rates and lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank often raises interest rates aggressively, but not always; the key factor is how the economy and financial resources react.
That is why the central bank officials have already stressed the fact that investors would not pay attention to the start of raising interest rates, but to how long it will take to normalise the situation.
There are, of course, a number of variables involved.
In the end, however, market players may find that any fuss about raising interest rates may be exaggerated.
"The first withdrawal of the Central Bank after the global financial crisis was undoubtedly often interpreted as a sign of the end of cheap money," Julian Jessop, Chief Global Economist of Capital Economics, told his customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect a gradual return to a relatively low level of interest rates, which is a frightening seismic shock for many.
However, that does not mean that there are no effects.
Here, based on historical trends, examples of how impacts can be reflected in different economic areas:
As has been seen in the market for about a month, for some time the prognosis to raise interest rates can increase instability.
When interest rates finally rise, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"The trend seems to be to stop interest income on capital after the first increase for 12-24 months, which perhaps reflects a delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank's analyst in a recent study of the consequences of the increase in interest rates.
In a revised 35-year period, the market usually sees a sharp rise in interest rates of around 14%, a fairly smooth next 250 days (mean increase of 2.6%), a normalised situation after 500 days, with an average return on interest after six stock markets of 14.4%, says Bob Doll, the Chief Equity Strategy of Nuveen Asset Management in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutsche, the impact on shares tends to increase at a slightly later stage of the cycle and interest income is beginning to decrease.
The recession is a fact in the economy, but the rise in interest rates usually works.
In this case, if the central bank meets conditions that did not exist in the past and could accelerate the downturn.
Particularly noteworthy is the fact that gross domestic product is at its lowest ever in view of the increase in the central bank's steering interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, 118 interest rates have been raised since 1950, only twice the nominal value has been below 4.5%.
Although the second quarter of 2015 shows 3.6 per cent, many did not think it would last, and the third quarter is 1.5 per cent," says Atlanta's regional central bank.
Interest increases in such a sensitive economic situation may have risks and may be asked whether this situation is different, Deutsche said.
Market participants have been talking about raising the interest rate throughout the year and look at this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which will end on Thursday.
Many strategists and economists believe that even if the Open Market Committee were to approve the withdrawal at this meeting, futures trade would only show a 25% probability.
"In our studies since 1950, all the lifting cycles up to today have been in a supercycle, where even before the downturn GDP rises very rapidly since the start of the upturn," says the report.
The recovery has been very slow compared to the worst recession of the control period.
The cycle is clearly the longest that the Central Bank has been waiting for since the last recession. The record had been 35 months, and it is now going to be the 74th month.
Fixed-income securities have also been unstable in the market's case for raising interest, and the formula is repeated on the capital side.
"The underlying difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than on shares when the central bank changes the exchange rate.
For bonds, the return appears to change direction immediately when the first up/down cycle starts.
At the end of the rise cycle, revenues will fall immediately," Deutsche stated.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that raising interest rates makes long-term and short-term bonds approach each other and even out the curve.
"High-income bonds often do better in such an environment, although we are still cautious about profits," said Kathy Jones, an analyst in Schwab's fixed-income securities.
Intriguingly enough, according to Jones, the market has already adapted to the future change of direction of the Central Bank.
"In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and inflation forecasts, there are already several signs of adjustment to the tightening of financial policy," Jones says.
Short-term interest rates are on the rise, the yield curve is direct, the credit spreads have expanded and volatility has increased.
To a large extent, companies mainly active in the US market benefit from falling interest rates and attracting local products.
The outlook for indebted multinational companies is weaker, as the growing dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market and the debt is higher.
"Historia shows that quality shares are more profitable over the next three months," Goldman Sachs analysts tell their customers.
Companies with a strong balance sheet beat the weak balance sheet companies by an average of five percentage points after the 1994, 1999 and 2004 interest rate increases.
Enterprises with high return on capital and low volatility shares also performed better than the lower quality, by an average of 4 and 3 percentage points.
"Bet is a big question.
Companies with a significant share of floating rate debt will lose most," said Goldman.
Outside the stock market, consumers also generally benefit from the appreciation of the dollar.
The savers also benefit from higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly the effects are visible.
Parliamentary Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM
Conservative Andrew Bingham criticized the radio station for overpopularisation.
According to Bingham, it is difficult to distinguish the channel from its commercial competitor today.
Also claims the BBC Music Awards Awards are just a copy of the Brits.
Parliamentary Damien Collins, on the other hand, accuses The Voice of impersonality.
According to a prominent parliamentarian, BBC Radio 3 is gradually becoming a copy of the Classic FM channel.
Conservative Andrew Bingham also told the BBC leadership that the broadcasting channel is becoming too populist and that the channel is no longer very different from its commercial competitor.
"I don't want to talk about popularisation, but Radio 3 seems to be changing in the direction of Classic FM," said Bingham.
The BBC Music Awards Awards held last December will also receive criticism from Bingham:
"The BBC Music Awards held for the first time last year seem like a copy of the Brits Awards.
These two are examples of the fact that instead of new and different, we are simply imitating what is already on the market," says Bingham.
The Director General of the BBC denied the accusations and stated that the provision of BBC Radio 3 has significantly more live music and enlightening content than the commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 taught me something about classical music that I can't learn from other channels.
The channel's commitment to living music and music is in its own class.
I also consider it important that Radio 3 is also committed to finding new music and ordering new works," said the Director-General.
Earlier this year, Alan Davey, director of BBC Radio 3, said that the station needs to work harder to maintain the public's interest, as the British know classical music even better.
However, Radio 3 is not the only channel that received criticism of entering the territory of commercial channels, the BBC channel, at the hearing of the limited Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Tory MEP Damien Collins criticised the search for the Voice talent contest that the BBC bought from the Dutch producer Talpa Media. The price is estimated at £22 million.
"The programme is not much discussed because it is not unique or particularly distinctive."
According to Lord Hall, the program presented by BBC1, as star judges by Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced in a way typical of the BBC.
Collins also required the company to look for a hit program in its own garage when it next launches a new entertainment series.
However, Collins refused to exclude the continuation of the Voice series or the use of taxpayers' money for other entertainment formats.
E-commerce growth is the slowest ever in August - perhaps the reason for Black Friday
In the first months of 2015, e-commerce grew by seven per cent.
Online sales have been recorded since 2000. Last month's growth was the slowest ever.
The online store strengthened three years ago with mobile shopping.
Experts believe that the black Friday of November can contain the desire to buy.
For more than ten years, the conquest of online commerce has devastated many of Britain's shopping streets.
According to experts, there are indications that the online store is stabilising and new sales figures indicate only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
In August, the growth of total sales was slowest throughout the period when e-commerce sales have been recorded, i.e. since 2000. Last year, e-commerce grew by only five per cent.
According to experts, there are indications that the online store is stabilising and new sales figures indicate only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If you compare last year's growth to the 2000 figures, it is clear that the growth will stabilise over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor-in-chief of IMRG, to Guardian.
According to Mulcahy, the online store accelerated three years ago when consumers accepted mobile shopping.
"It enabled more and more people to buy online, and it was possible to buy for many people in different environments, for example from a couch at home.
As mobile shopping is now more moderate, growth can stabilise."
Black Friday from America is a phenomenon considered one of the causes of the slowdown in growth.
According to experts, the last Friday of November may cause consumers to postpone their purchase decision before the black Friday.
Last year, five times as many online buyers as normal caused many traders' websites to crash.
Experts believe that black Friday, which forces consumers to shove after offers, can curb the desire to buy in other times.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, a good pound for every five pounds was spent online.
More than one third of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, are purchased online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of shopping fashion shops.
Mecca buries the victims of crane accidents, the family of Bin Laden.
The Muslims carried the bodies of 29 victims on the streets when the first funeral took place in Mecca.
According to Saudi Arabia, the major construction company Saudi Binlad Group is partly responsible for the accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were also injured after the crane fell.
Bodies were carried high in the air as Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the crane that fell on Mecca's Grand Mosque.
On the streets, crowds of white-dressed people had gathered to say goodbye to the victims on their last trip to the Al-Moissem cemetery.
The grief escort went to a pilgrimage place where the fallen crane had only a day before penetrated through the mosque's roof over the Muslims.
The king of Saudi Arabia demands that Bin Laden's construction family company be held responsible for the accident, which also injured 394 people.
The bodies of the 29 victims who died in the crane accident of Mecca's Grand Mosque were transported on the streets.
When the crane fell, Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, was among the dead, who had traveled to Mecca on his first pilgrimage.
Akram had accompanied his parents in the Great Mosque who were about to begin their annual hajj pilgrimage.
The Saudi authorities have promised that the Hajj pilgrimage will take place when thousands of people are arriving in the city for pilgrimage.
According to King Salman, the Binlad Group should not have left the cranes up when the crane was not used.
According to the Arabic press release, the Binlad Group is partly responsible for the accident.
The news agency's English service did not report this in detail. However, according to the English press release, the management of the group has been prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this week Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall in the yard of the Great Mosque. Thousands of Muslims are heading to the Great Mosque for the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binlad Group has not published a notice on the crane accident and the group representatives have not been reached for the purpose of the opinion.
The king also accused the group of failing to comply with current safety regulations and cooperating with meteorology experts.
Ten cranes surround Mekka's Grand Mosque as part of Binlad's giant construction project.
For decades, Bin Laden's family has had close links with the Saudi Empire family, and the Bin Ladens are responsible for several major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was an apostate son whose family had abandoned in the 1990s.
A crane accident in heavy rain and high wind occurred only a few days before the pilgrimage to Mecca, which every capable Muslim is obliged to do at least once in his life.
According to the authorities, 158 people are still in hospital.
The authorities ordered one million rials (about EUR 250 000) to be paid to the families of the victims and permanently disabled.
The other injured persons receive half of the compensation.
According to B&Q boss, the phenomenon is driven by a cheap Eastern European workforce
The British hire home generals more often, says Veronique Laury.
The popularity has been increased by skilled, professional workers from Eastern Europe.
More than 200 new Screwfix stores for workers will be opened.
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores all over the country.
Text: Rupert Steiner, Chief correspondent, Daily Mail
British people are said to transfer home hammering and painting work to authors from Eastern Europe.
Hammering and painting skills seem to be scarce these days.
The British now increasingly hire home handicrafts to do home work, says the head of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury is the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns a supply chain for home repairs. According to Laury, the phenomenon is driven by skilled workers arriving from Eastern Europe offering services at low prices.
As a result of this phenomenon, Kingfisher intends to open up 200 new Screwfix stores for traders, while closing 60 B&Q stores.
Laury needs more female labour at B&Q stores, as eight out of ten purchasing decisions are made by a woman at the store.
At the moment, most of the staff are men.
According to Laury, demographic trends deserve attention, as more and more women living alone are now renovating their homes.
"The staff of our stores is still mostly men," says Laury.
"We need to balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80% of the decisions to buy products are made by women.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of five women who are at the helm of British companies within the FTSE 100 index. She has also reorganised the company's management team so that men and women leaders are equal.
Kingfisher is almost one of a kind, with exactly 50% of its staff being women, including the Managing Director and the Financial Director.
"This was a conscious decision. Diversity is an important subject for us," Laury said.
"It hasn't been difficult to find good women in the management team."
There is a decrease in Kingfisher's six-month operating profit and sales figures, even though the company was working shoulder-to-shoulder after the shops were closed down.
Kingfisher responds to current trends: the company owns the Screwfix and B&Q chains and intends to open up 200 new stores.
The government of three aces decided to resort to coercive legislation to save the country's economy.
The visible effects were quite rapid.
The sharp head of SAK and other employee centers began to be forced immediately and as a result the country stands on Friday because of the widespread expression of workers.
A lot of people think there's reason to stand there, too.
Let's see if it's worth a strike when things are bad anyway.
Even a resistance movement has been established.
More than 50,000 people have already been online to announce that they are not going to participate in the demonstration but go to work.
In an old time of good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no Internet where to protest, but openly declaring yourself a scab would have been the political suicide of a small person.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of millions of trade unions does not give much thought, but it gives cause for thought.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as self-evident as it was 20 years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement as their own, values have changed
From the point of view of the interest in the operations of the Ay movement, the harsh solutions of the government can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
After years of showing that things are rolling with their own weight, the unions are finally getting to the point of defending, visibly and properly employees' rights.
In this way, the government may want to imprison the role of the Ay movement, as membership in the trade union is perhaps seen to be more necessary than before.
Regardless of what the organizations say, it is nonsense that Friday's expression of mind would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has been falling for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to decline and unemployment is rising.
You'd think these things would force everyone's head.
The University of Lappeenranta has a hard austerity cycle: The aim is to save EUR 8.5 million, reducing staff by 130.
The University of Technology in Lappeenranta will start a savings cycle aimed at reducing costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the University will open negotiations on staff as a whole with a savings target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, this means a reduction of around 130 employees.
In addition, two million are being saved from other activities.
The CST negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which anticipates an actual deficit of 8.5 million.
It is also affected by the cuts made by the government.
During this financial year, the University will produce approximately 2.6 million deficit results.
Expenditure will increase slightly next year, while funding from the Ministry will decrease by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The university's total budget is approximately EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive cuts in education and research and the reduction in corporate funding in our university is very significant," says Rector Anneli Pauli in the University's release.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but the reduction in complementary funding now appears to be in new proportions.
Negotiations with the stewards will start next Tuesday and will last the six weeks laid down by law.
Yle: Onnibus wants to visit Finland's railways
The owner of the Cheap Bus Company Onnibus, Sir Brian Souter in Britain, tells Yle that the company also aims at rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in getting involved in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of Britain's largest railway companies," Souter says.
Rail transport should be gradually opened up to competition.
The first is local traffic in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in 2017-2018.
Following local traffic, long-distance traffic will take place.
Souter says he's already approached the Department of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes Onnibus' plans.
Of other international companies, at least Transdev (former Veolia) has announced its interest in rail transport, which also has bus services in Finland and rail services elsewhere in Europe.
Time for the interest rate ruling at the US central bank
The whole world is following Fed's meeting on Wednesday and Thursday, where a possible increase in interest rates will be decided for the first time in almost a decade.
A good half of the economists, who still thought the Central Bank would raise interest rates last week, are now betting that the Central Bank will maintain interest rates at 0-0.25%, as shown by a survey conducted by 80 economists.
"This is a historical situation, as the central bank has been holding interest rate zero for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a significant central bank can raise interest rates from zero to trigger normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Senior Researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The economic situation in the United States has been relatively good, and the recovery has brought in billions of extra dollars in the balance sheet and only slightly accelerated inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore a global situation that is less rosy.
It has urged the market to prepare for change, but there are also indications of the opposite.
The decision is due to be published on Thursday at 20.00 in Central Europe time.
The shooter at Delta State University left an apology note.
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - before shooting a colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note apologizing for the first murder and hoping to cancel it, the authorities told me on Tuesday.
At Delta State University, Mississippi Gautier, Lamb, who taught geography and social science, called 911 about 10:00 a.m.
On Monday, he told me he shot a man.
Lamb called 911 and asked the police to come home.
"I shot my wife last night," Lamb told me, and she also mentioned that there was a friendly dog in the house that wouldn't hurt anyone but probably scared.
The police asked for the name of the caller, but he wouldn't tell me.
Lamb didn't give us a motive for shooting either.
The police arrived at the scene and found Amy Prentiss, 41, the body and a handwritten note written by Lamb, saying: "I am very sorry and I wish I could cancel what I did.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the message, Lamb drove 500 kilometers to Delta State University, where he killed Professor Ethan Schmidt of History before taking his own life late on Monday when the police reached him.
William LaForge, headmaster of the university, said that he was not aware of the conflicts between Lamb and Schmidt, but he said that there was clearly something wrong with Lambia.
On Monday it was reported that Lamb presumably believed that Prentiss was in a romantic relationship with Schmidt as well. However, the authorities reported on Tuesday that there was no information or evidence of the triangle.
Shawn O'Steen, married to Prentiss for seven years, described his former wife as a good person.
The couple had been divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen told me he and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter who's upset.
According to the husband, the daughter and mother were best friends.
According to Sun Herald, Prentiss' close friend Lindsay Knowles told us that Prentiss worked online from home.
Knowles said that Prentiss had been dating Lamb for about three years, and he also told me about a woman's dog named Lightning.
"He always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
According to the police, Lamb had called his relatives on Monday and told them he wasn't going to prison.
When the police reached Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville that same night, Lamb stopped the car, fled on foot, ran into the woods and took his own life.
According to the CV on the university's website, Lamb received a doctorate in education at Delta State University in spring 2015.
Dimmed Stars
The past few years have been hard on the actor (in the picture on the left with his son Redmond).
In 2001 he fought leukemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner, Farrah Fawcett, died of cancer.
The actor has also struggled with drugs and was arrested in 2008 for drug possession.
Everything that has happened has really taken its toll.
Manchester United Luke Shaw on the sidelines for months due to two fractures
Luke Shaw's right leg broke in the Manchester United Champions League match against PSV Eindhoven.
The defenseman is sorry to stand by for at least six months, but Louis van Gaal is still hopeful and believes that Shaw will return to the fields this season.
The 20-year-old Shaw was injured in the PSV defense area in a poor tackle by Héctor Moreno while the game was running for fifteen minutes.
Shaw received emergency care in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he could be transferred to the hospital.
"Shaw has two fractures on his leg, and he's in hospital," said Van Gaal.
Shaw will be transferred tomorrow or the day after tomorrow for surgery to Manchester.
A young man who joined the Manchester United ranks at the age of 18 has been through a lot and is now offended by great gaming practices.
In the locker room, Shaw was given oxygen.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but when the leg breaks in two places, he'll be on the sidelines for half a month and he won't play in the block stage anymore.
I hope he can still play this season.
Moreno seemed to have gotten off easy when the situation didn't turn out to be a red-card penalty kick.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish the Mexican player.
Van Gaal says the Italian judge made a mistake.
"You may conclude for yourself, but I thought the situation was worth the penalty kick and the red card.
It was a two-legged, reckless tackle."
Shaw tweeted like this: "Thank you all for your messages. I can't tell you how devastated I am. My recovery begins here and I'll return stronger."
More information: Manchester United Luke Shaw paged in the PSV match
The English defender has a particular reason to recover to compete at the European Championship in France in June.
"It's a very bad injury," said PSV's coach.
"In such cases of injury, all parties are always very sorry.
Players never intend to harm their opponents."
Moreno broke his legs while playing the Netherlands piloted by Van Gaal in the Mexican ranks until the 2014 World Cup.
"He's very sorry because he didn't mean to harm his opponent. I'm sorry to hear that the injury is serious," said Cocu.
"I didn't see the situation myself.
All I saw was a ball going the other way, so it looked like he was touching the ball, but I didn't see Luke's tackle."
"I know how it feels. I know how difficult this situation can be," Moreno said to SBS6.
"I feel really bad, I'm really sorry."
The PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
David Cameron should know Lorax better.
Sooner or later, each parent finds that the child learns his favorite book almost by heart.
Except to see David Cameron.
When the Children's Holiday Association asked Cameron to name his favorite children's books, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, a teaching environmental story published in 1971 by Dr. Seuss.
In the text published on the SuperCamp website, Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. "The story is fun, touching and creative, and it has a powerful message. I like to read it to my children because there is always a picture or message that we have never noticed before."
Sounds good, except that the next part where Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book is a summary of the 2012 film version, adding new characters and details to the short initial text.
"In a city where real trees and plants have disappeared and even air is a commodity, there lives a boy named Ted who wants to get into the heart of his dream girl Audrey by fulfilling this greatest dream: see the right tree," says the text. In the 1991 version of Dr. Seuss, or Theodor Seuss Geisel, Ted had no delight.
If this isn't suspicious enough, Cameron's text is partly consistent with the plot summary of the Lorax movie on the Internet Movie Database. It begins as follows: "In a city where everything is artificial and even air is a commodity, there is a boy named Ted who wants to get into the heart of his dream girl Audrey."
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the plot of the book would be so foreign to him. Greedy Kerskanen destroys the trees and makes Tarvi in spite of Lorax's resistance to them. Lorax is a small and thick, mustache creature that protects the forests.
Probably a public relations mission such as this, of minor importance, has been entrusted to an assistant, apparently to someone who has not read Lorax 20 times in a row as a child.
The Prime Minister's representative said that the text probably came from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps didn't comment further, but he confirmed that the text was Cameron's staff handwriting.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being off the English team, but it's still hard.
The meeting with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but after seeing the loss of the last 3-0 series of tests selected by England for the tour, it is not expected to happen again.
I wouldn't rule out the possibility of a foreign win.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the team three years ago, but the batting team has good players and the team's attitude is strong - they have no bad experiences from 2012, only youthful positivity.
As a ball player, Moeen Ali develops as a spiral pitcher, and Adil Rashid, even though she does not have a Test-level experience, represents an attack option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from the English Test Team and replaced Alex Hales
Clearly, the decision to exclude Adam Lyth is difficult for me to understand as his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven Tests have been against two good attacks under challenging circumstances, and the simple and cruel truth is that cricket players are judged according to the results.
For example, Joe Root is not a questionable choice because - as I have said before - players are the best voters.
A few 50-point fights would have kept Lyth on the team, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets another chance when he hits Yorkshire with more runs.
The head coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, also praised his attitude when he didn't do as well as he could, which doesn't surprise me.
The question of how long the test hitter gets the chance to impress is difficult.
Lyth got seven ground games, like his predecessor Sam Robson, while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance at both home and guest games.
The only complaint is perhaps that England first used Jonathan Trot in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in top shape - but this missed opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales is on the team, and he's a hitter that I value high.
He's a cricket player of an unknown author, which we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he scored 236 points against us on the Trent Bridge field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but of course this depends on the composition of the United Arab Emirates team.
The idea has been thrown into the air that Moe will start a batting shift with Cook, so that we can get an extra spiral pitcher in the game while holding four quick pitchers, and I'm not against the idea.
I see no obstacle to a top pitcher being able to hit here, and this left-handed player has already shown himself to be a great cricket player.
Moe may not have accomplished much in his local team in Worcestershire, but he's been team three player, and that's not a big difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Test matches as the first replacement player before he could start in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points, and there was no going back.
Zafar Ansari is on the team as a backup spinster, and based on what I've seen of him, he has proved to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his stats - an average of 31 points as a hitter and 35 as a pitcher - and this may be a long shot, but not a lot of spiral pitchers have shown themselves to be ready, and the voters decided to take a young player.
He'll learn a lot during this fight trip.
Outside the playing team, England seems to have made a couple of smart choices for its coaching staff.
The appointment of the Sri Lankan hitter, Mahela Jayawarden, as Advisor to the Test Games may be a breakthrough.
This is one of the sweetest men of the species who brings with him much experience because he has played under all kinds of circumstances and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes on a game trip to the white ball and brings both energy and ruthlessness.
I think he's always seemed to fit into an international cricket, whether he's a player or a coach, and like Mahela, he's got the brains to use.
Sometimes a new voice in the locker room, even if it says the same thing as before, can be a cheer-up shot.
Colly's teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, has rested in one day's fights, Root had a similar opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and voters do not set the game schedule.
And it must be borne in mind that, like players, their jobs depend on results.
These decisions are never taken without consideration.
Brexit camp can win if the economy is in bad shape in 2017
David Cameron's halfway negotiating strategy for Britain's stay in the EU is becoming deeper and deeper every day, even without a pleasing Jeremy 'yes' or no' to choose Corbyn for Labour leadership or the TUC making a huge mockery of Europe on Tuesday.
Other countries have their own Corbyns and Nigel Faragens.
The European diplomat recently explained how many crises the EU is wrinkling - although not everyone is an act of their own - and some of the Member States are tired of the self-righteous agenda of Britain, which includes dissensionary concessions and damaging changes to the Treaty that they do not really want.
In Brighton, the annual Congress of the TUC decided that they would not like it in the EU if it would undermine social security.
We could call it Dave and George's Selfie Agenda.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor hang out at summits and bilateral negotiations in the capitals of different countries, catch a picture of themselves in front of a famous monument, with or without high-ranking people, return home and tell them that they have acquired allies for reform.
Everything has to do with me.
My European friend, who wants an open-minded Britain inside the EU tent. "Don't leave us alone with France," Berlin says and suggests that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in different capitals have reached the point where we no longer care whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the prudent German Chancellor is an ally, but has been in power for ten years and wants to leave the post before it spoils, as happened to those who stayed too long: Thatcher (11 years old), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande is facing a re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is fading, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, while Spain has a left-wing government.
It is hard to imagine them rushing to help the selfie British who could use their energy better to try to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, nor do they want it because most people have separatist tendencies.
Some of these ministers can plan to deliberately throw useless comments into the Scottish National Party style in the UK's 2017 popular election campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"The newest negotiations were organized, and Britain didn't have anything to do with the re-negotiating negotiations."
Europeans know how the British press is preying and how the EU-skeptical the oligarchist press is, just like the 1975 referendum by Tony Benn, the result of which was 2:1 for accession to the EU in 1973.
Perhaps someone will remember remotely Boris Johnson, a Euro-opportunist who became known as our 'European correspondent for direct bananas' in Brussels in the early 1990s.
At least Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They include tax evasion, phone hacking and seemingly temporary residents who own most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair felt roughly the same about them, but then he realized that when you're in a cage with a rough gorilla, you have to hand out bananas as a distraction so that the gorilla doesn't eat you for lunch and dinner.
Miliband was also more blaritic than Blair in his opposition to the referendum, because Blair agreed to the EU Constitution, which was then rejected, and when France and the Netherlands rejected the agreement in the referendum in 2005, Blair was conveniently off the hook.
The press never forgave him, either.
But the nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly patted me on the back at Westminster on Monday, I told him that he had no more time to waste on me, and there might be a risk that he would introduce Neil Kinnock's media boycott strategy from the '80s.
Time may pass, but Corbyn needs to develop a consistent strategy for dating the media. Not with me, but Andrew Marrin, on whose BBC couch he sat on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what we politely call upbuilding.
He says he wants to keep us in a reformed Europe.
Most people outside Ukipin and Tory can probably say yes to this.
That's what Hilary "Benn but not Bennith" Benn told on the radio and on television this week when his inner boy scout tried not to admit that it was a bad move for Corbyn to call rough John McDonnell shadow finance minister.
It reminded me of the '70s when his old father had trouble being disloyal to his Labour colleagues on television without going too far and losing his place in the House of Commons.
Hilary's troubles were more interesting.
Mr Benn said that he was opposed to staying in the EU under 'all circumstances': McDonnel did not say so either to his colleagues and members of the House of Commons at a private meeting on Monday evening.
Wanted Corby to care no matter how silly the picture was, you have to remember that he even touched me. Message discipline is important in the 24/7 era, especially in the discipline of social media, where paranoia and deception swarm.
Mr Cameron does not need to be given a free pass in relation to the EU, which would allow him to take Labour's support for granted in a referendum, as Mr McDonnell has said.
This is what Simon Jenkins thinks.
McDonnell's and Corbyn's equivalent of membership of the EU fits into the bennite blockade and the anti-capitalist past. Discussions no longer belong only to a limited circle of left-wing dissidents, to whom the idea of similarity being linked is a key doctrine in doctrinal disputes.
There has also been an equivalent of NATO, and Tom Watson is steadfast in that Corby is not campaigning for departure, and foreign diplomats are forced to try to clarify the matter in their countries of origin.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital? They have suspicious voters; why should they give concessions to Britain when everything can be in vain?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the poor British military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even during the surgeries of the Tory government, which I received on Monday during the launch of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize the British authorities' statements on electric cigarettes
According to researchers, the claims made by the state-funded institution that the burning of electric cigarettes is 95% less harmful than traditional smoking were made at a meeting with 12 participants connected to the tobacco industry.
Experts criticised the evidence provided by the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and Lancet Medical Journal in the Public Health England (PHE) report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE described its report published last month as a "translatory and comprehensive review of results."
However, several researchers have questioned the certainty of the information and have highlighted the links of some experts with the tobacco industry.
Last month, in the editorial of the Lancet Medical Journal, the teeth were "a remarkablely flimsy foundation" on which PHE's main conclusion was based.
In addition, two researchers have considered in the BMJ whether the claims were based on "rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic assumption of public health is that policies are based on clear evidence of their effectiveness."
According to McKee and Capewell, the general public assumes that PHE's claim that "at present, according to best estimates, electric cigarettes are approximately 95% less harmful than conventional cigarettes" should be based on detailed analysis and modelling of research results.
The claim stems from a single meeting of 12 people, which was convened to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model, which sought to harmonise participants' views on the adverse effects of nicotine products.
According to McKee and Capewell, the supporters of the meeting included EuroSwiss Health, whose former independent research has been funded by British American Tobacco (BAT), according to sources.
In addition, in the sustainability report, the Executive Director demonstrated its support for the public health activities of BAT.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting provided funding from an electric cigarette manufacturer, but the alleged previous funding from the tobacco company Philip Morris International was not provided by that participant.
The selection criteria for the panel's composition have not been clarified, but there are a number of well-known e-cigarette supporters, some of whom recognise their involvement in the financing of industry.
However, some of the participants are not aware of their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE's tobacco manager.
According to McKee and Capewell, the group's study report shows that there is no conclusive evidence of the harmfulness of the products in relation to a large number of products and the fulfilment of their criteria.
However, links or shortcomings are not mentioned in the PHE report.
According to the PHE report, so far no evidence has been provided that electronic cigarettes can promote smoking by children or non-smokers. McKee and Capewell consider the claim premature.
According to Professor Kevin Fenton, the director responsible for health and well-being of PHE, the claims have been answered earlier.
According to Fenton, electric cigarettes are considerably less harmful than traditional smoking.
Every other person who smokes throughout life dies because of tobacco addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of electric cigarettes are lower than those of traditional tobacco, but the long-term effects need to be further investigated.
PHE is obliged to inform citizens of what evidence shows and what it does not show, especially in a situation where relative risks compared to traditional tobacco are unclear.
There are nearly 80 000 deaths each year in the United Kingdom in relation to smoking, and smoking costs £2 billion a year to public health care.
Responsible action requires that we clearly present the current evidence that electric cigarettes are not a risk-free option, but that they represent a fraction of the harmful effects of traditional tobacco.
The BBC should give up EastEnders," says Channel 4 boss.
Luke Johnson, head of Channel 4, has stated that the BBC should stop broadcasting certain programs, including EastEnders and The Voice. According to Johnson, commercial competitors would give their right hand to hit series such as Albert Square.
According to Mr Johnson, the licence fee should only be used for the production of programmes which are not carried out by other television stations.
He criticised the presentation of programmes likely to be smaller than the BBC, at the same time as the large numbers of competitors, and on the BBC4 channel for example.
After the president of the BBC, Tony Hall, announced that the company wanted to increase cooperation with other organisations, Johnson said that he had been trying for six years to get Channel 4 to cooperate with the BBC, without success.
"I do not agree with the idea that the BBC is buying formats and sending programmes that are clearly part of the software of a competing channel," Johnson told the House of Lords' Committee on Communications, which was looking into the future of the BBC.
If the BBC wants to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think is necessarily a good idea in the medium or long term, it should reduce its offer to programmes that are not produced and bought by others.
The BBC will send The Voice at the best viewing time because it wants the widest possible support in the future.
If no other channel takes the show, it's obviously ridiculous nonsense.
"I do not understand why a regressive tax should finance programmes that could be financed without subsidies," said Johnson.
The Voice is one of these, EastEnders another, although it is its own production.
A lot of channels would give you their right hand for it.
I do not understand how this serves the service provided by the broadcaster.
I don't think this would be a loss for the BBC."
Johnson is a serial entrepreneur who was in charge of Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010. In his opinion, the BBC collects good ratings because the company employs ambitious people and they believe that it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson's comments on the BBC's most popular series are similar to those of the former Sky boss Tony Ballin, who suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in 2003 that the BBC sell off series such as EastEnders.
According to Johnson, the programmes for the BBC's Niche audience are shown on the BBC4 channel, where the ratings cannot be measured, but the programmes fulfil their purpose. "BBC can say in defending its hypocritical missions that £4 billion of broadcasting fees have been made by special programs that no one was looking at'.
"BBC presents them at times when no one ever sees them."
Johnson said: "I challenge you to find another system that is just as old-fashioned in the sense that who gets the best benefit.
Of course, everyone thinks that £150 a year is cheap, but the people for whom it is a lot of money, especially if you don't look very much at the BBC."
David Elstein, former director of Sky and Channel 5 channels, who also expressed his views in committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should exchange its ancient missions for new "information, teaching and entertainment."
According to Elstein, BBC's current supply is unlikely to have educational programs - 1% on television and 0.1% on radio - and he adds that the BBC should learn from Australia and Canada's public broadcasters and recite its mission to a new belief: "information, enlighten and entertain."
On the question of cooperation, Elstein suggests that the BBC could increase transmissions, for example, from events such as the Proms Festival, where only a fraction of the concerts were broadcast last year. "BBC should also join the Alliance with commercial channels so that the entire supply is also available online," he continues.
Brain cells can be controlled by sound waves using sonogenics
The video shows how the shuttleworm changes direction when they are subjected to ultrasound.
Scientists have grown worms whose nervous system has been genetically altered, so that worms can be controlled by ultrasound.
Small shuttleworms change direction when they are subjected to an ultrasound with a frequency above the hearing range of the human ear.
Sound waves activate motion nerve cells that have been genetically modified with a transport membrane that reacts to ultrasound.
Further information: Researchers monitor brain activity through light
According to researchers, worms were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new Sonogenics method, using ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells with an external stimulus.
Salk Instute's researcher Sreekanth Chalasani, in La Jolla, California, told Guardian that the method can one day replace deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS treatment is an invasive method used to treat Parkinson's disease symptoms by stimulating the brain with electrical impulses.
Shuttleworms do not normally respond to ultrasound. Chalasani noticed that the worms are beginning to react when they are placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
According to Chalasan, the bubbles amplify the ultrasound waves that move into the worms.
The amplified ultrasound waves affect the TRP4 ion channels, which are found in parts of the cell membranes of worms.
According to an article published in Nature Communications, sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells to which they are attached.
In order to control the shuttleworms with an ultrasound, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that I could see the TRP4 ion channels from the nerves that controlled their movement.
When ultrasound was directed to modified worms, microbubbles strengthened sound waves and moved to worms, triggering a signal in the nerve cell.
The method is somewhat similar to optogenics, a revolutionary tool that allows researchers to activate nerve cells through light.
However, according to Chalasan, sonogenetics have certain advantages over optogenetics.
Light is directed to the brain under study by means of optical fibres. Low-frequency ultrasounds, however, penetrate the cell easily, so that ultrasound can be directed to the brain through the skull.
"We believe that gene therapy and antiviral therapy can temporarily expose human nerve cells to ultrasound signals in a clinical environment in certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
According to the researcher, the method could also be used in muscle cells and insulin - producing cells.
Illegal torture equipment - at your doorstep!
Advertising is a disgrace to Britain's arms trade.
Watch Amnesty International's anti-armed mass video.
Terrible killer missiles!
Ankle-breaking legcuffs!
Crayfish!
Telepaths that cause unbearable pain but leave no trace!
The video is produced by Amnesty International and is intended to highlight the British Government's desire to sell arms to repressive governments at the Security and Defence DSEI (Defence Security and Equipment International) fair, which is held at the ExCel exhibition centre in London's Docklands.
More information: DSEI positions: authoritarian regimes arrive in London
Posters pop into bus stops and subway cars that require another look.
"An important announcement: do you take the subway 15-18 September?" The report resembles the announcements of the London subway, which is a picture of a tanker at the end of the metro line.
"In September, a group of arms dealers will arrive in Docklands. Customers will be asked for help so that the weapons fair can be terminated."
Three hundred posters have been made by artists whose work was featured at the Banksy Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped to distribute posters around London with a six-pound "advertise hack package" with six-cool keys that claim to have access to about one third of the advertising posters of the world's bus stops.
Transport for London isn't laughing at poster vandalism.
One of the prank ads for the Special Patrol Group.
According to the curator of Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, Gavin Grindon, the artists have begun to question things and want to bring their political works to the public's attention outside the galleries.
Artists have found that social influence through art requires that art be brought into the real world, and many move on to work with activists from protest movements.
One of the posters against the arms trade greets public transport users on the subway.
Amnesty's video has been viewed over 100,000 times during the day via Facebook. It has been designed without compensation by the advertising agency VCCP, and both graphic designer and teller have also done their work without compensation.
The artistic director of VCCP, Matt Lever, was surprised by the absence of fair advertising and the blank spot in the ExCeL event calendar. He thought, "Let's give them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They tried to make a more realistic, shady corporate video, but bright colors and animation attract better attention."
"They've done a great job and helped us to bring up the fair where illegal torture equipment trade is carried out," says Amnesty's Tom Davies.
"Now the government must take action to ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded at our very doorstep."
Perhaps the most creative feature of the gun fair is, however, shown in ExCeL itself, where exhibitors make use of staggering euphemisms about their merchandise.
In its press release, Saab announced an order from the U.S. Army concerning "the portable AT4CS RS."
The product includes "a specially shaped warhead that effectively penetrates directly into the target."
That doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight golden rules for students living in student housing
I moved to a student dorm 11 years ago. I was an innocent 19-year-old and still believed in bars and moral relativism. Only now do I remember the obsessive smiles I provoked and countless long complaints from others.
The most important lessons I can summarise are eight simple rules.
Moving to a dorm is the least stressful experience and, at worst, shocking.
In this situation, you start to talk easily: tell everyone where you are, whether you liked the year and why, what you like about Corbyn and why you don't "really hate or love Marmite, because that's just yeast extract, hahaha, I'm in my room."
Take a breath sometimes.
And help others to breathe: show interest and ask others questions.
Asking questions will guide the conversation and help you find people you like and people you wouldn't even talk to when your lashes were in flames and these people would share fire extinguishers.
Give the others some space.
My own rooms often serve as drinking counters, cinemas and public living rooms, but also as a place to dress, starting with lingerie.
More on the subject: Don't even think about combining dating and university studies
For the Introverts, the university is a tough place.
However, many dorms form a social culture that wanders from room to room and creates lifelong friendships.
Such a culture can be a nightmare for a person who needs a place to return.
It is not possible to say in this environment: "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to leave so that I can recharge the energy I used by dating you."
Try to see if one of your fellow students is exhausted from social interaction. Perhaps you should not knock on the door and send a text instead.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
There was a guy in my own student dorm who thought the unlocked door meant he was welcome in.
He saw a lot of things.
Make friends by baking.
You start your studies properly when baking is in, so if you bake brownies and knock on someone's door, you don't seem like a 50's, a little weird thing: "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something small. Smile when I'm curious about personalities."
Homemade delicacies are a great way to make new friends.
Your fellow students have to talk to you, and thanks to a pleasant surprise, they can have a positive picture of you.
Of course, this requires reasonable bakership skills.
If you serve unhappy lumps of flour, sugar, and fat, others will probably pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Stealing food is also a common violation in student housing.
Taking another chicken is, of course, stealing, but is it okay to pour a splash out of someone else's milk can?
Always check with the owner of the milk can.
Probably get your permission, even if the milk was quoted by the owner of the can.
I understand very well that it is annoying if someone steals something from you. However, try to deal with the situation as adult as possible - unlike my own fellow student who blew the detergent in his milk to punish the milk thieves.
She's in prison now.
Do not make noise when others try to sleep or study.
Not only is it polite, but it is also worth remembering that anyone who digs a hole for another...
In my own dorm, a girl asked the neighboring roommate to adjust the music to a lower level, since it was three o'clock in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The neighbor just increased the volume.
When she finally shut up in the next room, the girl let the neighbor sleep for two hours and left for three hours for the exam, left the music in her room and locked the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dorm?
And wouldn't it be weird if you thought first that your student friend was your future mate, that you would start dating, resign, and have to see him every day and lose the right to meet your mutual friends with him?
If the student is definitely not the only one, try to control your desire.
If you notice at a hilarious moment that someone has forgotten their keys to a room with a door unlocked, the limit of pranking and bullying is more volatile than one might think.
A good joke is funny, but one you'll recover from in a moment.
Hiding an object may be a valuable and fun lesson, but no one's room should be messed with toothpaste and shampoo.
You can lock the door in the other room and drop the keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer, but don't attach anyone's things to the ceiling with a blue sticker a couple of times more.
Racist attack on the guesthouse of foreign students with crystal - House planned for reception center was shattered in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist blow was made to the guesthouse of foreign students in North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police told us earlier, this is not the accommodation for minors' asylum seekers, but the sleeping quarters of foreign students who have been in Finland for longer," says Heidi Luukkainen, teacher at the Evangelical People's College of Kite.
The windows and walls of the folk high school accommodation were shattered with racist signs such as swastikas, and a metal object had been thrown through a window in one of the accommodation spaces," says the Eastern Finland police.
According to Luukkainen, the responsible teacher for youth guarantee education at the folk high school, there were an estimated ten people in the vandalism building at the time of the attack.
"It was the weekend and adult people were free to move, so some could have been elsewhere," Luukkainen says.
There are people from 12 different nationalities staying at the folk high school.
They have already been students in Finland for some time and have recently arrived underage asylum seekers.
Everyone in the messed-up building has a status.
Some study in adult primary school, some study in vocational studies and others study Finnish," Luukkainen says.
A status is a so-called continuous residence permit, which can be issued for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
The Eastern Finland police investigates the attack as an act of damage and a violation of domestic peace.
According to Luukkainen, a briefing was held to students on Monday, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for over ten years, and this is the first time anything like this has happened," Luukkainen says.
Luukkainen says the mess has already been cleaned off the walls.
At least three men were suspected of being involved and had been on the move in a light passenger car.
I think this is the whim of a youth weekend night, since this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious than that," Luke says.
In Salo, too, a hospital has been smeared and a reception centre has been planned.
The case happened last week.
It was announced on MTV's website on Tuesday night.
A swastika was drawn on the wall of the hospital and written in English "You are not welcome."
There's been a police report.
Revision 15.9. at 16.02 Corrected police incorrect information about the age and status of the people living in the building.
The government is shutting down the Y train to Karjaa... with the passengers starving... "Oh, that's so idiotic."
The Y train from Helsinki to Raasepori Karja stops running in March.
The news upset the passengers who started the train at Helsinki Central Station.
In particular, the crash strikes the Siuntians," said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It is quite idiotic because the population is growing and those who work need a quick and smooth connection with Helsinki.
This cannot depend on anything other than political will - or lack of it.
Bengtström says on HSTV's interview video, he's gonna take a tractor to the capital.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H and R trains on the main line are combined into a new R line.
Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula will be disabled.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR released information on which routes the Ministry purchases train traffic during the next contractual period.
The term of the contract will change at the turn of the year and the routes to be closed will be available throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement to be finalised in the autumn will be adopted by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Bengtström, a Siuntioist, believes that the government's train cutter is short-sighted.
Make the same mistakes that have been made in the past and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then comes remorse.
The Y train is also used by non-Raseporians and Siuntians because it is fast and passes several stations.
Annina Pöyry from Espoo was troubled by the fate of those travelling farther from the city area by train.
"That's exactly what sucks for those who have to redesign their journey," he said in pain on the Y train.
There's gonna be a little relief.
There will probably be a new train connection to the beach track that replaces the Y train in Helsinki's region of traffic (HSL), i.e. takes you all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This brings additional costs to HSL, in practice the municipalities of the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now beginning to explore different options and their impact on service level and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to assess the costs accurately.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about a million dollars a year for the Y train, although the Ministry is much more than this.
The R line on the main track misses two stations.
On the other hand, the number of train shifts in Ainola and Saunakallio doubles.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease from the whole country.
The Ministry no longer buys train traffic on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki- Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route will be shortened to Pieksämäki- Varaus.
Train shifts will decrease on routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka harbour and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million trips a year are made on excruciating shifts, while the total number of trips purchased by the Ministry is about nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring savings to the State of 12,3 million a year.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the Capital Timeliness book: "Marx is worth exploring"
The crises in the world economy have brought Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main theme Capital, published between 1867-1894, to the surface, writes George Hakanen, former Chairman of the SVP, in the book The topicality of Marx's Capital, published today.
"He will be taken more seriously now than in a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx's assessment of the development, internationalisation and penetration of the capitalist economy has proved surprisingly far-sighted in all areas of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of capital and fictitious capital.
The list of authors of the book based on the Capital Seminars organised by Hakanen also includes Aalto University Professor, respected financial advisor Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes Marx is current "now and forever."
But the former CEO of the Business Research Institute and the Business Delegation isn't Marxist, is it?
No, no, no, no.
On the phone, Korkman tells us that he does not consider Marx to be a timely economic thinker but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and scholar of literature.
"The usual idea is that the history of ideas tells of the wrong opinions of dead men," says Korkman.
True, Marx's predictions went badly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far from the initial course of capitalism, Korkman ponders.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"The most relaxing thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
We are discussing the interests of Marx again, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may be able to give inspiration to someone who wants to understand a big picture, a world changing as a result of a technical revolution," Korkman analyzes.
But what the government should decide tomorrow won't help Marx.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should just be stopped.
Still, Mr. Korkman thinks it's worth exploring Marx.
"In the '70s, Marx couldn't be read," says Korkman.
"The Maoists and the Trotskys and other sects hated capitalism, but even more each other."
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political burden of the past years.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's mindset - like other classics," says Korkman.
The UN demands war criminals to be convicted in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for a special court to be set up to investigate war crimes committed in Sri Lanka's civil war, reports AFP.
The UN report on the civil war in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long postponement.
The report blames war crimes both the Sri Lankan Armed Forces and the rebels known as Tamil Tigers.
At least 100,000 people are estimated to have died in the Sri Lanka Civil War.
We don't know exactly how many victims we're dealing with.
In particular, the major military attack in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, as called for in the UN report.
The Sri Lankan Armed Forces report blames torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, the victims of which were as likely as men and women.
According to the report, the rebels have been guilty of forcing bystanders and children into combatants.
According to the report, both sides have committed murders.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intended to organise the investigation itself, but did not intend to allow the establishment of the UN Court of Justice, as foreign judges.
The English yo test allowed you to weigh social media.
Autumn matriculational writings featured a long foreign language on Wednesday, most of which was English.
More than 16,000 trainees tested their English skills.
You could write a paper on social media if you wanted to.
Based on our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the essay of 150 - 250 words in English could be addressed to the e-journal counsellor.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt corresponds to Leelia's resting chair in Finland.
He was to ask for advice on how to get parents to look at things for young people too.
In total, there were four subjects, one of which had to be selected.
"It was the hardest of them," assessed the third topic Mia Lybeck, English lecturer at the Swedish secondary school in Porvoo.
On the third topic, there was only a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
But Lybeck said the fourth topic was pretty cool.
It had to write a fire talk about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least our school has practiced writing speeches," says Lybeck, and estimates the whole experiment as "pretty normal."
In Finnish - or Swedish - the English test was able to answer questions about texts that called for, for example, the adaptation of summer sole to climate change and the processing of large data masses.
Also on Wednesday some long Russians (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were written.
The autumn articles will continue on Friday, when the second Finnish or Swedish or Finnish test will take place.
In upper secondary schools, the test is arranged normally, which means that the employee statement does not affect it.
The matriculation examination board invites students to search for suitable transport connections in time so that they can make it to the test event.
You can also have more time if you can show that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
In Oulu, a shop was robbed at gunpoint.
In Oulu, a shop was robbed on Wednesday morning in the district of the clock.
According to the police, the robber was dressed in dark clothes and a ski mask covering his face.
He's a normal body. He's about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money.
They're investigating it as a felony robbery.
Police are preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of protesters in Helsinki - support teams from other parts of Finland
The government's protest against cutting decisions will block the city center of Helsinki on Friday, predicts the police.
According to preliminary data, up to tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, Akava and STK's unions meet at the Railway Square at 11:00.
Police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
In turn, the task of police officers at work is not only to carry out emergency tasks and other police activities, but also to ensure the success of a giant demonstration.
Roads leading to the railway market will be closed to motor vehicles for a period of approximately 9.30-14 hours.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed into the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi traffic will be cut off at Kaisaniemi's roundabout, from the west to Mannerheiminti.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
At least for the time being, it looks like it's enough.
I'm not gonna take a stand on a cop's work-fighting case.
According to Kujala, support teams from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki.
The police don't give us exact patrol numbers.
"Something is coming, but as a rule, we can manage on our own," says Kujala.
The police advises to avoid private car traffic in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic fog extends from Hakaniemi level to its core centre.
Standing traffic is expected until the beginning of the morning.
With protestors from other parts of Finland there are also a lot of charter buses coming to Helsinki.
They won't be allowed to the Railway Market.
In principle, buses are quite remote.
The rest of the journey must then be walked to the protest site," says Kujala.
The statement also stops Helsinki's public transport.
From the police point of view, there's a positive side to this.
The issue of the flow of public transport, which is normally at hand at these big gatherings, will now be dealt with on its own.
The organisers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government's economic policy may come to Helsinki.
The police expect the expression to go peacefully.
People are ordinary working people or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
After all, Finnish people are reasonable and peaceful," says Kujala.
Local protests will also be held in different parts of Finland on Friday.
Friday's statement is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
In many ways, the big expression organized by trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional.
For example, there is no such good comparison in Finnish political history," says Professor Emeritus Martti Siisiinen of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It's no wonder the Ay movement is protesting.
If it didn't, it would raise hands in front of the government," Siisiinen says.
The very right-wing government has hit the core points of the Finnish corporate tradition - and also those that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard grip is missing in contract law.
There are a lot of features here that the Ay movement is really being tried to get on its knees.
The same ay movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
For example, a mirror is needed because the ay movement does not have the support of all employees for Friday's statements.
What is new now is the sharp division that the expression of mind will bring about in the group that the Ay Movement would want to participate in the demonstration.
The unemployed from different parts of Finland showed their minds at the Parliament House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a reference point for Friday's expression, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed," says Siisiainen, organized in 1993.
In the middle of the deepest recession, the Murder Thursday gathered 20,000 unemployed.
The Esko Ahon (central) government stumbled from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relationship between the Finnish Government and employees' organisations had never been as bad before as during the Aho bourgeois government.
Now the relationship between the government and the Ay movement may be even worse than it was in the days of Murder Thursdays.
Besides, Finland's largest bourgeois government is now in power," Siisiinen says.
The current government coalition is still so interesting that it is so tight on the right, despite what the basic Finns have said.
There were certain elements of the old labor movement at the time.
Several thousand protesters are expected on Friday.
The expression also stops public transport and possibly closes up day care centres and schools.
Although the expression does not receive undivided support from employees, it can become the largest for years.
In recent years some 300 demonstrations have taken place annually in Helsinki.
They're from side to side.
Traditionally, Finnish AY protests have been quite peaceful - although practices have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is law-abiding.
The protesters strive to avoid damaging or destroying property," Siisiinen says.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of protest changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous about throwing eggs and the police were prepared to get pig shit on their heads.
The firefighter strike lasted for three months in 1998.
There were also spectacular strikes among pilots and air traffic controllers.
Remember these strikes and protests?
Metal and electrical strikes of the 1970s
The most significant strikes in the 1970s were metal strike in 1971 and power strike in 1977.
Seventy thousand metal men participated in the strike of the metal men.
The strike was suspended by a motion from the Conciliation Committee after seven weeks of the strike.
The metal men got a 16 percent raise.
In the spring of 1977, the power strike lasted 49 days and caused blackouts across the country.
Murder Thursday, 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20 000 people, many of whom were made unemployed by the recession, met outside the Parliament House to express their views on the job.
Firefighters strike for three months in 1998
The firefighter strike was one of the longest in the 1990s if not the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were caught in an egg rain while farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
"Siberia teaches, the EU quits" was one of the slogans.
For Espa, farmers skipped tons of snow.
The 1999 Helsinki EU Summit also prompted farmers to protest and burn hay bales in front of the meeting place.
Nurses strike 1983 and 1995
Nurses struck for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been on strike in 1983.
The strike in 1995 was colored by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened with strike and mass redundancies of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass redundancies finally accelerated the negotiations.
Doctors on strike 2001
"Doctors on strike - forced" was the slogan of strikers in 2001.
The strike of municipal health center doctors and hospital doctors lasted for about five months and produced a lively debate on how strikes can endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised the salaries of doctors.
Students on the move in 2013
Around 5,000 students marched for student support from Senate Square in Helsinki to Parliament House in 2013.
Central Crime Police investigates the background of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police
The Austrian police have requested assistance from the Central Criminal Police to identify the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped a truck in Asterheim near the German border with 42 refugees.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
Everyone in the cold truck was in good shape.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility are at the scene in Austria," says Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the Central Crimes Police.
At the end of August, other refugees on board a lorry in Austria became more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board apparently died by suffocation.
According to U.S.R., who first reported cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited company.
Among other things, the company engages in restaurant activities and its CEO is a man of foreign background, approximately 40 years old.
In Austria, two Iraqis have been arrested for smuggling human beings.
A refugee-beating captain, a former drug courier and a wealthy businessman - a story of five smugglers
A wealthy king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a stylish missionary and a taxi driver who thinks he's a good guy.
For example, these people are engaged in the smuggling of human beings into the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola at the University of Trento and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "clients," and the book Death Travel Agency is published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present tentacles in human smuggling, make suggestions for solutions, and present smugglers on different steps of business.
HS presents five of them.
I'm gonna beat the shit out of them right now.
Kerkenna islands on the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head there for summer.
The islands are also ideal for smuggling, as there is only 120 kilometres to the island of Lampedusa, Italy.
For comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a burning captain in the chain and the father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimps, but it is more productive for fishermen to carry people.
That's what Emir has done with his blue, ten-foot wooden boat hundreds of times.
If the boat is full, it can accommodate 40 people.
After one trip, Emir earns about 8,000 euros.
Emir has five assistants looking for clients all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis flared up again.
Customers arrive from the mainland to Kerkenna islands in small groups.
Emir will put them in empty houses for as long as it takes.
Food is given in such a way that customers barely survive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer runs out of money, that is their problem.
We're going out to the water at midnight with a shut-off lantern.
The first night is driven off the islands, then stopped, waited for the day and driven the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes seafaring is hard, and passengers cry and vomit when they reach 20 meters [20 m] high.
At the destination, the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir is on his way back.
Emir wants people to be afraid of him.
That's why he beats his clients and at least claims to beat the shit out of them.
He says in the book that when the police caught him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed clients one by one from the neck and threw them overboard," says Emir in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of the Sahara.
I hear he's gotta beat up his countrymen for this.
I'm gonna beat the shit out of them right now.
We need to show them who's in charge here immediately.
Just a regular cabbie.
Goran is a regular taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.
His cab isn't very good - the starter engine is pulling its last and it's seen its best days anyway.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi moves at all and moves towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where families are mostly admitted.
In the forests surrounding the city center, men traveling without their families are staying in tents, lavas and abandoned cars, which now everyone has managed to find or build.
Families living in the forest who have not submitted an asylum application to Serbia for one reason or another.
Some also stay in private dwellings, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans the route requires a large number of border crossings and weeks of walking in difficult terrain, often mountain areas and in the dark.
Eventually, when entering the Bogovaða area, the great node of human smuggling, people are tired of death.
Goran's riders are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their business once and that's enough," Goran says.
He says the Africans are trying to bargain.
That's what Goran doesn't like.
He's a jerk all the way.
For example, the price is set at EUR 300 first, then they count it to 200 and finally offer 150.
Goran points out that he's a nice man with a good heart.
I don't care about money.
I just do my job and help people," he says in the book.
Goran tells us that he works at a lower cost than others and that he only charges EUR 50 per person for a ride to the Hungarian border.
It's about 200 miles away, most of it nicely on the highway.
I hear that colleagues are asking for three or four times the price.
Goran earns about 50,000 euros a year.
It is not a large sum for smugglers, but in Serbia a very nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not be transported 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his rides a mile from the border.
Then he shows his clients the right direction and he flies away.
In the Work of Mercy
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called the Missionary, and it's not just a nickname.
He really does have a Protestant church in Kampala, Uganda's capital, visited by many of the refugees from Congo, as well as a small center for helping Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business in which people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He sees himself doing the work of loving - kindness.
It's important to the missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and makes sure that the rubber band of white underwear peeks elegantly underneath the low waist of the jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his terrain car and his three motorcycles.
When the missionary does not preach, he arranges people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
The customer initially calls one of the five telephone numbers of the missionary.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money carefully, and stumble into the shopkeepers crossing the border.
In order to get an asylum seeker or refugee status to the Ugandan authorities, we must tell them that they come from, for example, the war zones of Northern Kivu and that they have been forced to flee violence from their homes.
Often it is true, but if not, the missionary will arrange a new identity for the customer.
The old ID will be destroyed and the replacement will be replaced.
The missionary's contacts in the Ugandan police will help with that.
After that, the customer will be directed to the same place where the real asylum seekers go: asylum application, to NGOs, eventually to the UNHCR.
The missionary knows bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He charges separately for each step: submitting an application to the Ugandan police costs about EUR 100, managing documents for humanitarian organisations approximately EUR 150 and moving to a country in Europe for example EUR 4 500-7 000.
Folio and ice cubes
Tom is a beginner smuggler, a former drug courier.
A 40-year-old Irishman on duty off the coast of France in Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks on their way to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan, a French taxi driver living in London, and dozens of truck drivers who do not even know they are in the human smuggling business.
At night Tom and the taxi driver picked up their customers, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near the centre of Calais.
They're driving on the A26 and trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would go straight to prison for organizing illegal immigration.
Tom doesn't want that. He's been sitting on drugs for seven years.
Taxi stops, Tom and his customers run across the highway to a resting place where drivers sleep before continuing across the Channel to the British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck - we need to make sure it's on its way to England instead of Holland - and cut off the safety cable on the cover.
We have to do it quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver's in on it, but then it's more expensive.
Once the route is clear, Tom will wrap his customers in aluminum foil, the same kind that is wrapped around a roast or baked potato in the kitchen.
It should prevent a police thermal scanner from picking up the hidden device.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his customers in the truck and leaves the place hoping that the driver will not sneak in before Britain.
King of smugglers
Mummer Küçük is one of the world's most famous human smugglers.
The immensely rich Turk has been called the champion of marketing and the undeniable king of illegal invasions in the Mediterranean, which controls maritime routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and has continuously developed new methods of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he requires the money only when he arrives.
One of the new methods is the luxury craft scam: from Turkish ports they rent yachts to take American or European families to comfortable tourist cruises for a few days.
In reality, ships are being loaded to a crowd of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are being transported for a fee of between EUR 5 000 and 7 000 first from Istanbul to a port and then by sea to Europe.
Customers are kept in human stores, such as old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
They put people in minibuses and drive somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among the vegetation and wait for the sign.
When it is given, you must board quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden all the way under the deck.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, for there are no other signs of the crowd.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
Küçük will receive approximately EUR 53 000 for one luxury ferry trip after cost.
He doesn't handle practical matters himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, shelters and other smaller people to do the work for him.
During the summer season at least hundreds of transports are organised and Küçük makes millions.
He is thought to have bought undercover companies throughout the country, a pharmaceutical company and over a hundred apartments he rents.
Mummer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a member of the Turkish Democratic Party and an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical sector.
Since then, apparently, he's disappeared.

The American Olympic Runner tells about his illness and becoming a prostitute in his book
The new book by Suzy Favor Hamilton, a 1,500 - meter runner, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton in his book Fast Girl tells about ending his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published fragments of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the races in top shape and ran at the qualifying for the second best time.
But in the final, he panicked.
At the outset, he rushed to the top and defended his position of leadership with a maniac run.
150 meters before the goal, however, his strength was exhausted.
He collapsed to the surface of the track, and the other competitors passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot and thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself over the finish line," says Favor Hamilton in his book.
Later it was discovered that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt tremendous pressure for success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when he became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but she was fascinated by the idea of getting money for having sex with strange men.
She also convinced her husband to accept his actions.
Favor Hamilton's rate was 450 euros an hour.
He tells me he spent the money on a luxury life.
Another explanation of Favor Hamilton's becoming a prostitute was that he longed for the same adrenaline spikes as he had in competing in athletics.
Later, Favor Hamilton discovered that he was suffering from bipolar disorder.
The double life of a former stellar runner came to light at the end of 2012 when Smoking Gun magazine published an article on him.
Favor-Hamilton attended the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was one of the world's 1,500 metres in the time of 3.57,40, but he was last in the Olympic final in Sydney.
The world champion rejoiced when the union brought the Norwegian ski rooster under control: "Right back"
Norwegian ski king Petter Northug has exceeded the limits of propriety to at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Association have twisted the whole summer and autumn as in last year's athlete agreement.
Even though the union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been good enough to multiply the world champion and Olympic champion.
The Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northug from the World Cup for the coming season.
The decision was commended by the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was happy that the union put the ski rooster under control.
"Thank you for pointing your spine," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the union sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Northug seems to want to be part of the season's national team so he can advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent an alliance that would also take care of future generations and would not allow one athlete to solo.
At the same time, he recalled that Northug had been granted financial and other privileges by the Federation for many years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has a completely different set of rules than just because he's the best.
On Tuesday, Northug issued his own release, in which he declared that he wanted to play in Norwegian colours next season at World Cup as well as after World Cup and Olympic Games.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six World Championships, two gold medals.
Last winter, he was on the team that won the message gold in Falun.
Steak Translators' Shield Day is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On Shield Day, September 25th, there will be raptures in various restaurants and shops, which have been awarded the Roast Translators' Shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high-quality food expertise and lower the threshold for going to the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the plate as part of high quality.
At the same time, we want to remind you that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, but that the top restaurants audited and rated by an impartial operator are found all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of plate restaurants and organisations.
In Ostrobothnia, the day will be held in Vaasa Restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola, the Old Town Restaurant takes part in the shield day.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It has been decided to make the event one of the most significant international events in the organization, which will take place during the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland will continue to be the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki-lehti: A complaint to the Chancellor of Justice concerning the establishment of a Kauava reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to set up a refugee reception centre in the premises of the Kauhava ex-ship owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the critical infrastructure of the crisis period, which is used by the military and its partner, Finland's Separate Networks Ltd, is still located in the region on a permanent basis.
The Kauhajoki magazine says that, according to a private individual, investing a reception centre in the same building structure would constitute a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the armed forces may have interests related to the territory of the former Air War School and the airport, which have also not been explained in the preparation of the reception centre, the paper writes.
The case states that negotiations have been held over the last two years on the organisation of flight training and the outcome of any foreign operator to the airport.
The matter has been discussed with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistön (Ps.) and Secretary of State of the Ministry of Defence Arto Rädy.
A private person tells the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not about opposing the reception centre in principle but about the wrong place planned in the former garrison area.
The Kauhava City Board discussed the reception center issue last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Management means that immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö comments to journalists in the evening after meeting the chairmen of all parliamentary parties in his official residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, concern about the management of the refugee situation brought together all participants.
He considers it valuable that in Finland government and opposition parties are able to discuss the fundamental issues confidentially.
Especially in these times when we face major challenges
According to the Niinistö, the situation in Syria and the actions of Russia and the United States in the region can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, the Baltic Sea region.
Niinistö is optimistic about the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia will be able to do so, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the tension in the Baltic Sea.
According to the Niinistö, the NATO issue was also discussed.
The President did not take a position on the labour market situation.

The Finnish Agency for Early Childhood Education promises to inform you more about changes in operations tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, communication needs a variety of channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio talks are one channel among others.
Such a direct talk channel will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time," Sipilä said to journalists in Parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches become a recurring habit.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be delivered on Yle's channels.
If other channels sign up as a channel, we'll see.
This channel is being used tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires TV and radio speech for citizens.
This subject, which we are talking about here, is quite complex and requires a longer explanation.
That's why we ended up on this channel. Sipilä figured it out.
The speech will be broadcast from 21.05 to 21.20 on both TV1 and Radio in Finland.
You can also watch it in Yle Arena.
Sipilä's taking a big risk.
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä's television talk will not tell us about the more general internalisation of the government.
Is it the intention to take the right to define public debate more firmly into your own hands and refuse to discuss questions in the public debate? asks Professor Anu Koivunen of Stockholm University.
Reminds me of Mr Soin's recent comment that he does not follow the media agenda and lets it define himself.
In the interests of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these issues are not related.
Koivunen understands that commercial media is indignant about Sipilä's announcement.
It would be weird if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not announcements in democracy.
The role of media representatives is, by definition, to try not to take the political agendas as given.
According to Koivus, TV talk is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations of the speech.
Is there any more that we have heard today?
Or is he able to speak in a different tone, in a different way, or in different words, or to say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only going to be more of the same old, one must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
In this sense, too, the superiors take a risk if it is not a special situation but a routine speech among others.
There is a risk that Yle will be branded as a communicator of politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in line with Yle's interests or general policy.
Clever bet by the Sipila
In Sipilä's forthcoming speech, what the Prime Minister does not say is also important, the media researcher emphasizes.
In the evening we should look closely at what Sipilä is missing and not at," says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at Jyväskylä University.
According to the moon, the TV talk is a clever bet from Sipilä, because this allows him to bring out his own view without the sound of gravel.
This will bring the message to the public without a journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
Sipilä passes the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a risk that the media will misinterpret something from the speech, because no specific questions can be asked.
According to the moon, it's very important how Sipilä plays on TV - whether the sweat leaks, whether the hands tremble.
He compares Sipila to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can make a good presentation, it can work.
The situation is different from that of the government's being informed about something, because here, as it were, a person is speaking directly to another person.
This is what Obama and its partners do regularly (President Barack of the United States).
Very extraordinary.
Political researcher Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to the public to be truly exceptional.
According to him, it has not happened in decades for the Prime Minister to speak directly to the people.
An exceptional time requires exceptional means," says Railo.
The researcher thinks that this is the way the Prime Minister wants to get the Finns to sympathize with the blackmails ahead.
On Friday, wage earners' organisations will organise a demonstration and strike against government action.
Paavo Arhinmäki, President of the Left Alliance, says on Twitter that Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a announcement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed.
Antti Rinne (sd.) President of the Social Democratic Party announces that he will challenge Sipilä to dialogue.
This is no time for monologues.
Soon, six months after the election.
You can't hide for the end. Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on the run has been found in Tampere.
The boy was okay when we found him.
The kid's found it, and the kid's dad updated his Facebook pages.
The Police Department of Inland Finland also confirms the case to the Evening Magazine.
The boy went out to play around 4:00 in the afternoon.
Later in the evening, he was no longer contacted.
My father thanks all the people who helped me find him.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short period of time.
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed in the violent fad of young people: You create hatred
The Kurdish free fighter Makwan Amirkhani released the video on Facebook, which particularly appeals to young people from immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani made a speech against youth street fighting.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and who arrived in Finland at the age of five with his family, has so far won both professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking for a look at an Instagram account.
Videos have been downloaded into the account where young people fight with extreme violence.
Amirkhani tells me he's disappointed in the youth's fad.
26-year-old Amirkhan has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
Guys kicks people on the ground, sits on top of each other and beats without thinking about the consequences of this when you do such videos, Amirkhani updates.
It's hard to justify it anymore.
Some of the young people in the videos are of immigrant background.
According to Helsinki police lieutenant Jarmo Heinonen, fighting videos have been downloaded into social media by both immigrants and youths from Finland.
It's about you fighting on the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, Turku Amirkhani reminds us.
Amirkhani recalls that there are sites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
There have been quite a lot of these isolated cases.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be guests here for quite a long time.
That's a different way to thank you for being here, Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever become the target of racism, you will blame yourself.
Come on, guys, think about it a couple of times before you guys get in on something like that.
Amirkhani says that violent activity is a source of money for racism.
You guys make me hate things I don't like.
You guys are pretty bad anyway, and you're not gonna make it any better, Amirkhani decides.
SAK puts its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
Lauri Lyly, Chairman of the SAK, says on Twitter that the employees' organisation will consider its position on the alternative savings list presented by STK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on STK's proposal on Twitter.
Earlier on Wednesday, the staff centre organisation STKK announced that it would submit its own proposal to the government to achieve the 5% productivity leap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Kesk).
Mr Sture Fjäder, President of Akava, believes that the government will approve the proposal if SAK, STK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest SAK should soften its previous position.
Lauri Lyly, President of the SAK, said little on Twitter.
Mr Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock" and that agreements concluded by active parties are needed instead of compulsory laws.
Lyly points out that Prime Minister Sipilä's government's proposal for a social contract was not acceptable to SAK.
In the past, Sipilä stopped negotiations on a social contract when SAK refused to commit itself to the target of a 5% productivity leap.
Comment: There's a threat of a major protest... that it feels a little funny to shake a fist.
It does seem a little funny to put a fist in your pocket if you already have a reconciliation paper, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The moods vary from one side to the other in an employee camp.
Is it the intention to call down the government or to settle with it?
On Monday, the SAK's federal leaders expressed sacred hatred for the Government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened with arrest.
The hawk spread to the Aquavans.
The teachers' trade union OAJ threatened to close schools and kindergarten.
On Tuesday OAJ withdrew: no school or day-care centre will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd) was the president of STK.
He explained that he had kept in touch with the government and that he was preparing an alternative proposal for a 5% productivity boom, as demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Kesk).
Akava's president, Sture Fjäder (kok), immediately hurried to announce that his compromise paper is already ready.
There wasn't a peep from SAK's office at first.
It is difficult for President Lauri Lylyn (sd) to agree when the federal leaders just said on Monday to put the country on a stand on Friday.
Finally, however, Mr Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK would look for solutions to "open the labour market lock."
In order to create a joint proposal by employees, the SAK should be inclined to accept a 5% productivity leap as an objective.
It is no wonder that Palola's STK has relations with Sipilä's government.
The right hand of Palola, Jukka Ihanus, head of social influence at STK, previously served as special assistant to the Central Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
In fact, Palola described that the government's ay-know-how has constantly improved.
Coincidence or not, but the output of Palola took a little breath away from the Finnish solsticers, whose front image is marked by the ACP Marko Piirainen (sd).
It's kind of funny to put a fist in your pocket if you already have a compromise paper.
Edit at 6:00 p.m.: Added commentary for Lyly.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
Sergei Naryshkin, President of the Russian Duma, criticised the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
Sergei Naryshkin, President of the Russian Duma, considers Mongolia to be a better OSCE host than Finland.
In the capital of Mongolia, Ulan Bator, a autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun, in which Naryshkin made extensive comments on the Helsinki Celebration Conference in July.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians who had been forced into the European Union, such as Naryshkin, to attend a meeting - an issue on which the President was able to remind journalists.
We believe that this was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and to the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, according to Naryshkin's news agency Interfax.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU but also at the United States, where his access had also been blocked.
Sanctions are political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation got to Mongolia without any complications, so Naryshkin continued to pick up Finland by complimenting and thanking Mongolia for its "excellent organisation."
I am sure that the parliamentary assembly will go constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting that took place in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue should not have obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (Cok) who, according to the Russian media, has already discussed with the Russian delegation at Ulan Bator.
The lock meets the true playoff troll: "Males tight"
Tappara and the Clave continue in the Hawk Forest today as both are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that there will be no actual goal festivals in the Hawk Forest today.
Tappara went to Kuopio last night to dig a 3-to-2 profit from KalPa.
The rise was masculine, since last season's silver group was at its worst at the loss of two goals.
Tuesday of the lock was more minor.
The Raumans' catch of the smashed Blues was the guest of round zero points, and the loss figures were also 2-3.
Hard game, tight goals, if any play the same game as last year, Lukko-attacker Janne Lahti anticipates the setting on the club's website.
The killer has become quite a playoff nightmare for the Rauma.
For in the last two seasons Tappara has just dropped in the semifinals from the final series of the Clave.
On both occasions, a decisive seventh game has been called for.
Last season the Clave took the series to rehab already in the fourth game, but Tappara rose in the next three breasts and passed.
There are no major changes in the compositions of the groups except for the goalie.
The cashiers who rejected both of them yesterday get a flute shift today.
With Kappara's goal, Mika Noronen will make room for Tomi Bear, and between the Clave posts Rasmus Rinne will replace Ryan Zapolsk.
View angle: The ass is running a lousy play
The sports director Toivola wrote an inappropriate sequel to head coach Iron Rock, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote a Rocky movie in which he himself played the leading role.
The underdog put up a sensational struggle with the heavyweight world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a lot of sympathy, even though he finally lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's premiere, Mika Toivola wrote a restless Cinderella story to Pori.
An anonymous and wooden cauldron went to everyone's surprise at the Finnish Championship Finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but persistent underdogs like Rocky.
There were white Indians, Pori's Matt and Pele from Pele Pelto.
In the drop-off games, players colored their heads red and cut off the Iroquois.
Hope became a blonde.
Excellent TV reporter JP Jalo called Coach Neumann.
The aces took the silver that was won.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
Script writer Toivola believes that this season's renaissance works in the same way as it did ten years ago.
The man who works as sports director of the aces has built a pot roast on the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been hitting guys in the trough like Rocky pig carcasses at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Copper's earnings are in some other way than hockey.
Toivola has forgotten that in Rocky VI, the lead character is Pekka Iron Rockio.
Karri Stone has crossed Iron Rock with Sean Connery.
In Toivola's scripted Rocky, Iron Rocky is as clumsy as Connery would have been in the original of 1976.
There's no Rocky in the Iron Rock except a nickname.
Iron Rock's game philosophy doesn't include rushing and squirting.
He appreciates the hard game, but it's one thing to play hard like a pig.
Last season, Garret Stafford of the Aussies tackled Kappara with Jere Karelia.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Iron Rock put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
The only people that play for us are the ones who deserve it.
I don't accept that kind of game and it doesn't belong to the ace hockey, and after the game, Iron Rock, who was hot, got pissed off at the people of Satakunta.
The aces of this season's team is weirdly built.
We got kids, we got veterans, we got cops, we got hounds.
There are virtually no key men of best game age.
No wonder the head coach has been complaining about skill shortages.
How much have you been able to influence player procurement, Pekka Iron Rock?
Last season's events affected procurement and, unfortunately, the situation on the market was quite limited, Iron Kallio replied diplomatically.
It's smokin' underneath the surface.
The 1953 Iron Rock is reportedly interested in moving to Toivola as sports boss.
Men's contracts end in the spring.
The balance of the aces in the three league games of the season is equal to the loss of the goal difference 1-6.
Toivola shouldn't have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santa Santa Claus' mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuuka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under her husband's direction.
Yeah, I'm playing my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, the actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
She has been married to Apunna's ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temonen since 2008.
The couple have worked hard together before, but now Olga plays under Tuuka's guidance for the first time.
Olga's role in Apulanna's early years You made us beautiful is drummer Sipe Santapuk's mother Cricket.
Cricket crickets and supports his son, although his father Risto (who is represented by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I have become acquainted with my real role model, Cricket, the easier it seems to be to play the role.
He's a great guy and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me with the part.
Olga had already met Sirka before the film project, but since then, the two of them have come closer.
They've met, spoken on the phone, and they've been communicating.
Cricket's been really helpful.
We've been through a lot from different angles in their history.
Fortunately, the cricket also realizes that drama is drama and the truth may need to be colored a little.
Olga stresses that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apunna would become the largest band in Finland.
In the '90s, it was a recession and it was really lame.
There was a pretty low probability that someone really could, but Sirka had some intuition, and she was right.
Olga tells us that she had heard a lot from Tuuka about her youth even before the film plans.
However, the stories of parents have sometimes been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were up to.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from Tuuka, who was known as Heinola's notorious skateboarder.
Olga was an everyday and good girl who had nothing to do with Tuukka.
At most, he could have been secretly attracted.
According to Olga, he's worked so hard with Tuuka over the last ten years that a big project together doesn't scare him.
Everything's always been super good.
Now the whole production group is going to Heinola for a month.
True, a couple living in it often plan to drive home overnight because the distance is not too long because of their young children.
We're taking over Heinola for a month.
They have received us very warmly, only asked which streets and when will be emptied.
Iron Sky 2 became Finland's most expensive play movie
Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, has a budget of 17 million euros.
The shoot starts in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola begins filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
Scifi film Iron Sky's sequel, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, becomes Finland's most expensive play movie with a budget of 17 million euros.
Previously, Finland's most expensive film title has been Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation in progress will also rise after completion of Iron Sky 2, as the film has a budget of over 100 million euros.
The films directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa begin in October at Antwerp's AED Studios and last eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium next week.
A giant budget doesn't scare you.
I've been so relaxed!
I feel so relaxed about the script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone in the task force seems to realize that we're doing something that we've never done before.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Just because time's tight doesn't mean there's any fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience," he tells The Evening Magazine.
Originally, the budget for the film was set at 8-10 million, but as the manuscript developed, the budget also increased.
There's a big budget, but there's a big story.
However, 100 million could be added to the film because every angle and effect is so expensive.
Now everything's so tight, it's not loose at all.
Today, the film production company Iron Sky Universe launched a crowdfunding campaign and a bond with an annual interest rate of 4 to 8%.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
At the latest two years later, the company will repay the loan.
Udo Kieri, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov are among the actors in the action film.
Coward or cool?
Big logos go back to shirts
The fronts of the trendsetters have recently been adorned by big logos.
Not long ago, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
Advertising a hoodie or a T-shirt sign was seen as a bit of a hillbilly.
But times change.
Sportism has become a real megatrend of fashion, and so have the old, familiar sports molds such as Adidas and Nike.
And, like so often before, the line between funny and trendy is fluctuating: if something is right, it begins to turn into ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. the mold where trendsetters surprised by favoring the most boring basic clothes as a way to separate themselves from the mass.
Instead of a basic gray college, we're already putting on the sweater that's buried at the bottom of the cupboard, with the manufacturer's logo in front of it.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, Adidas' identifiable track co-drivers, favorite team jerseys and New York Yankees hats have made their way back into street fashion.
The Calvin Klein logos of the underwear that start to squeal on the edge of the jeans are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sportstimers to luxury brands as well.
For example, the front of Versace's scavengers makes clear what brand of clothing it is.
Would you be willing to introduce logos in your dress?
The Russian politician released evidence that I didn't get stuck for hours in the tank!
According to the claims, a special incident would have taken place in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015 was held for Russian military products.
In recent days there have been colourful claims in Russian media that the Russian Ministry of Emergency had to remove large Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything in his power to deny the information.
He even published a picture on his own public Facebook site where he seems to peek at the armored vehicle's hatch in quite good moods and at least those pictures are not about getting stuck or angry.
That's nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't enter the battle tank, but it was the assault tank BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier myself, Colonel, I've served at Ural.
I went inside, looked around and came out in peace," Zotov said to Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I didn't get stuck and I certainly didn't spend five hours in that position," he said.
On the Russian military television channel, Zotov explained that he admired the new Russian technology at the exhibition because he was a former professional soldier himself.
That's why I was interested in what was inside the carriages, and I admired our technique.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And even in the next exhibition I will definitely visit all tanks and all assault tanks," Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the reporter who wrote about it a fool.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside and came out.
I'm tall and ratty, but nothing like me getting stuck in a tank somewhere did happen," he said to Russkaya sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photograph of alleged sticking has been published, even though a total of 50,000 people attended the gun show in a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck was originally triggered by a case on Bloknot.ru, where Zotovin was told that he had broken out of the tank hatch while trying and threatened to shoot everyone around him if he didn't get out of his grip.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up article in which the exhibition organizers gave their views on what happened.
All they're used to is soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles quickly.
But Congressman Zotov, due to his large size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he certainly did not sit there for five hours," said Alexander Pisarevski to Bloknot, the coordinator of the exhibition.

A leak has occurred at the Kittilän mine of Agnico Eagle Finland, a Canadian-owned mining company.
The refined process water from the gold mine has leaked from the so-called tailings pond to the ditch.
According to the company, measures have been taken to correct the leak.
The pool contains neutralized tailings and purified process water from the foaming process.
In general, water is pumped either for reuse as process water or as authorised through the surface draining field into the environment.
The bleeding was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was observed.
According to the company, the quality of the leak water meets the current permit conditions.
No other matter spilled into the environment.
The leak was detected during the inspection round on Monday morning.
No structural damage to the reservoir's dam structures has been observed.
The company states that it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and remedy the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent employees.
Dansken Kuopopamäki: IMF warns against overcutting
The country report published today by the IMF is broadly in line with the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation pushed Finland into comprehensive structural reforms to cope with economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime allowances and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire contractual system and unemployment insurance.
According to Pasi Kuoppanmäki, the main economist at Danske Bank, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
The IMF estimates a lot of positive messages for government action, but on the other hand there are also warning words about what should not be cut too much.
These include investments in infrastructure, for example," says Kuoppanmäki to Talousanomi.
In the IMF's view, growth projects should also be implemented within the shortest possible timeframe to support weak economic growth.
The IMF anticipates an economic growth rate of 0.4 per cent for Finland next year, which will accelerate to 0.9 per cent.
Today, Danske's new forecast for the economic cycle predicts that growth will be zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have provided the basis for the latest findings.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported a small increase in total output in summer," says Kuopjamäki.
It has been possible to pay less attention to the weakened confidence of industry or other so-called softer indicators.
However, these differences are limited to a few percentage decimals.
Nintendo, recovering from death, appointed a new leader
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata who died of cancer in July, began her work on Wednesday, Nintendo told me on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and she was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for launching the successful Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimisha is no big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata's footsteps, assessed by Ace Research's analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
Kimishima's task is to bring Nintendo into mobile games, but not to eat the company's bread on the traditional game consoles side.
More and more minor asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service acknowledged that hundreds of children who have come into the country disappear every year.
SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter have reported this on their website, according to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of minor applicants disappear each year.
Chief Inspector Juha Kannelmaa of the Finnish Immigration Service tells us what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is there a similar situation in Finland?
How much of the applicants disappear under "land" per year?- In 2013, a total of 156 applications were made for asylum of minors who have been singled out in Finland.
We lost nine of them.
In 2014, the corresponding applications were 196 and 11 of them disappeared," says Kannelmaa.
The reasons for the disappearance may be that it is clear from the case that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and has possibly been found to be of age there.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue processing the case in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for examining the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, 134 of whom were subject to a decision to lapse because the applicant had likely moved out of Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared over the last 123 years," he says.
Is the number growing?
By September of this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum for minors who have come alone.
The overall statistics on missing minors are not yet available this year, but the number of minors is therefore known and clearly increased, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons, he stresses.
What about the proselytes?
Do they also disappear, for example, into the 'dark labour market'?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for the implementation of conversion decisions," Kannelmaa stresses.
Minister of the Interior Petteri Orphano (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered applicants.
He's taken action.
At the EU Home Affairs Council, Orphano, who discussed refugee issues, announced on Monday practical measures to manage the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see the photos of the equipment
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkonen for TV and radio productions is now on sale by a pioneer who has lost his job in the media sector.
Mikkonen's spouse, Nina Mikkonen, sells equipment on Huuto.net, which were once one of the most advanced professionals in the field.
The Internet ad was the first online magazine to be reported to my Evening Makas.
Today, much of the equipment has been left at the expense of technological development.
In the digital media world, television programs for Betacam tapes are no longer being filmed.
However, Nina Mikkonen is confident that interested parties will be found.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date, but these too will be needed as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitised.
On the other hand, there are also many hobbies - collectors and developers of their own studio," Nina Mikkonen ponders to IS.
The reason for the sale is that the Mikkonen are trying to move away from their current Storm Village home.
There's no way we can take all the stuff with us.
I'm slowly starting to inventory and see what things are being disposed of.
This is where I started," says Nina Mikkonen.
There is no longer any use for TV and radio equipment.
It is clear from recent strokes that a man who has worked a long career will no longer return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen's actual life's work was already archived in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up films and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic threatens to porch worse than expected: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
The drivers of the subway and trams will decide today whether or not they will expand their efforts in connection with Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to stop subway and tram traffic only during the demonstration on Friday.
In the afternoon, it will be decided whether traffic will stop all day.
Chief Trustor Pekka Hirvonen says that the poof is large in the field.
The night and shift operations are killing the drivers, so the government's plans to cut the extras are a source of opposition.
Hirvonen wonders, however, that stopping traffic all day is a kind of dilemma.
If the subway and trams stop by Friday, public transport in the capital region is virtually completely stopped.
According to VR's records, trains don't run between 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on Friday.
There will be no commuter or long-distance traffic on Friday.
Trains leaving before 6:00 a.m. will be driven to the station of destination.
According to HSL's records, most of the buses will be in the pit.
ACP members will be absent from work on Friday from 3 a.m. to 3 a.m. on Saturday morning.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, they are driven by superior forces, HSL's publicist Pirkko Repo thinks.
Repo says that HSL can't tell exactly which bus runs on Friday.
The wage earners' organisations organise a major demonstration at Helsinki Railway Square on Friday from 11:00 to 1:00.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place at the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, reports the news agency AP.
According to Sky News, refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water cannons against people.
A Muslim boy was arrested at a school in Texas... and the teacher thought a self-made watch was a bomb.
In the United States, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested since the teacher regarded the self-made watch he brought to school as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he just wanted to show off the output of his electronic hobby.
However, one of the teachers viewed the watch as a bomb.
The police were called, and the situation finally ended with the boy being taken in handcuffs to a juvenile detention cell.
Mohamed has never been found to have claimed anything other than that he had made a watch.
Still, it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a fake behavior.
According to Mohamed, the police had found that the watch looked like a movie bomb.
The clock is in police custody, but it was reportedly made up of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident occurred last Monday and Mohamed was punished for three days on forced leave from school.
His father is furious about the incident and the American-Islamic Council of the country is wondering whether this case is yet another indication of Islamphobia in the United States.
♪ Great Britain ♪ ♪ Labor leader refused to sing the national anthem ♪
In the song, God is asked to protect the Queen, but Corby is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism of the right-wing press has also been shared by members of Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has offended the people, believed Labour MP Kate Green at the BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corby should have joined the song.
Yesterday's Memorial honored the Battle of British Air Force pilots against German Lufthansa in 1940.
In its official statement, the Labour Party defends Corbyn and stresses that he paid tribute to the pilots by participating in the event.
We are all deeply indebted to the heroics of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national anthem, the statement emphasized.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided the ranks of the Labour.
In particular, there are those who fear that he will expel moderate voters with his radical views.
Corby's in favour of unilateral disarmament, ending austerity measures and increasing public spending.
For the first time today, Mr Corbyn is to appear as party leader in Parliament at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Mr Corby has asked the public for proposals on what should be asked by Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron hung on Twitter for the election of Corbyn as party leader.
The Labour Party is threatening our national security, our economic security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister tweeted with his own account.
The cause of the Minnesota family murder is still unclear - the father of the family was facing a lawsuit
South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating a family murder in Greenwood, Minnesota for a week.
A family of five was found dead in their home on September 10, and a couple of days later the police confirmed that the shooter was Brian Scott Short, the father of the family, 45.
After shooting a shotgun first, his wife and three children, Brian Short, killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days
The family was found after concern at school about the absence of children.
On the basis of this announcement, the police went to the house for a visit and found the short family dead all over the huge house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A Million House and a Successful Company
South Lake Minnetonka police chief Michael Sitar's case is still under investigation.
The motive for blood feuds is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and had created his assets on the social media site AllNurses.com.
In 2014, in an interview with StarTribune, Short told us that there are four million different visitors per week on the site.
I've been offered 50 offers for the company over the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to put into practice.
Perhaps at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
Among other things, the success was shown by the fact that in 2011 the Short family bought a crazy house in Greenwood for $2 million.
The house is advertised as a real estate site in Zillowi as a car collector's dream: there are not only 12 rooms but also a garage for eight cars.
Case pending
But according to StarTribune, the father of the family was awaiting a lawsuit.
Acchieve Test Prep, offering various prep courses, had sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, no pre-punching comments had been removed from Short's site and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a significant impact on Short's business.
Vesku Loiri offered me a cup of cake.
In addition, the owner trio was awarded with the Finnish Hippos horse owner's prize for the month.
This is great. Loiri commented in a good mood on her honorboard.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100,000 euros.
Artist legend Loiri was still confused by Fabrice Duo's success in the big race.
I still don't think it happened.
According to Lori, the coach of the successful horse, Korpi, will find full peace while working with the horse.
Pekka orders and decides where to take the horse to compete.
And I'll keep my mouth shut, Loiri bumped.
An amazing gesture from the NHL star, "The greatest donation ever made by an athlete"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P.K. Subban has donated $10 million (about €6.7 million) to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the hospital report, this is the largest single donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital with other fundraisers for the next seven years.
Subban made a deal with the Canadiens a year ago worth eight years and 72 million dollars.
So Subban's donation is significantly higher than his $9 million annual earnings.
Subban receives a lobby in the hospital for her donation.
Canadiens players have helped local hospitals significantly before.
A year ago, long-term captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same children's hospital and Saku Koivu collected a huge amount of money for another major hospital in the city to provide the hospital with the necessary PET scanner for cancer research.
You can order a wife from a Japanese café for the evening... serving food with nothing but bikinis and aprons on.
Theme cafes are tough in Japan.
There is already a goat café, a rabbit café, a vampire café, a hug café and now a wife café.
It hits the lonely, the needy, the hungry.
The news is from Metro.
From the Tokyo Ore no Yome café you can order a wife or husband for the evening.
It's a waitress pretending to be the client's wife.
The "half" is selected from the list before coming to the café and he prepares and serves food.
She's just up against an apron and a bikini with her husband in tight bike shorts.
The website provides you with all the information about the length and weight of your wife's candidates, always with the kind of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network: Attacks against car security started to be equipped
In addition, the Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) supports technological development and innovation in the sector," says Intel's release.
The Board consists of top security experts from all over the world.
Asrb researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections to standardise best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of best practices in cybersecurity.
The company will update the report on the basis of ASDB's research results.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consulting company, estimates that by 2020, around 150 million vehicles in traffic will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share web-based data.
We can and must improve the cybersecurity of cars," says Chris Young, Director of Intel Security.
With ASDB, Intel can establish best safety practices and support the view that cyber security is an important component in the design of every car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASDB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in data processing.
Ford Focus RS in Finland costs about 52 000 euros!
The Ford Focus RS model has been waiting for years like the moon rising.
Finally, the car is also starting to appear in Finland.
Ford released RS's information now that the car world is looking at Frankfurt's car show.
Ford's new four-wheeled RS accelerates with its 2.3-litre, 350-horse-powered engine from zero to 100 per second and has a peak speed of 266 kilometres per hour.
In Finnish terms, the price is also interesting; it is provisionally reported to be EUR 52 000.
The car is already available for order, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford does not report in his release.
Kia's favorite brand presented two new features at the Frankfurt Car Exhibition - a new Sportage and Optima
In Finnish terms, the new fourth generation Sportage is certainly more important than the two new ones, with which Kia intends to take a larger slice of the ever-growing SUV market.
The Sportage created under the leadership of Gregory Guillaume, the new European Design Director, is more round than before.
There's a centimeter between the axles and the outside dimensions, and the car's cutting the air even more efficiently.
The engine range is broadly unchanged, but a 1.6 litre turbo with 177 horsepower has been added.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption will be reported closer to the sale.
We'll have to wait a little longer for that, because we'll have a new Sportage in spring 2016.
Even before the turn of the year, the new Kia Optimat came to our country.
Suddenly, the novelty does not seem to have changed, but it is a brand new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of the upper middle class buyers with better driving capabilities, lower noise levels and higher quality equipment.
Optimos with 1.7-litre turbodiesel and 2.0-litre petrol engine are initially available.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate when Optima GT comes alongside them with a 2.0-litre turbo engine.
At the same time, it starts selling Optima Farmer.
Chisu returned to the stage... blew in a bold jumpsuit.
The singer Chisu is at the Life for the Child concert with other Finnish stars.
There's an impressive, open neckline in an electric pants suit.
The costume presents beautifully the singer star's graceful waist.
The whole is crowned with a golden metal belt and a red lipstick.
During a three - year break, a mother - made singer has lost her pregnancy pounds with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to turn one year old.
The singer released her first single on a new album in August.
I'm not really nervous about getting back on stage and standing in front of the public after a long break.
I've missed everything about music," the singer says.
In a couple of weeks, Chisu will release his new and at the same time his fourth album called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired the making of new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu will think.
Kim Kardashian's maternity style is astounding again - now you can see your chest
True TV beautiful Kim Kardashian gives the subject one after another.
She presents her pregnancy belly and breast gear freely in sexy clothes, last night at one o'clock in America when she and her sister Kourtney Kardashian left the gig of husband Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent for the breasts.
It reveals the color of the bra underneath the flickering flashlights.
The last time Kardashian wore an Amazonic maternity dress was when he visited a friend at a dinner party in New York just a few days ago.
The costume was emphasized by black overcrowded boots.
The third special maternity outfit is as fresh as last week's Friday, when the introduction was a pregnancy stomach.
The hard laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, the competition is terrible
The top model Manon Leloup wanted to correct the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary, Speaking Dolls, where Leloup and his colleagues talk about modeling.
Harpeer's Bazaar magazine compiled six hard truths from behind the scenes.
Every season starts with nothing.
Even if you had posing in top designers' costumes in the previous season, the new season will start again with castings.
And every season, there are new, fresh faces in the industry that compete with the bad guys.
Models rarely have places they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and can go for a year so that the accommodation is a hotel room or an apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearably difficult.
New York and Paris are wanted jobs, but they are the most stressful.
There's not just one kind of thinness.
Agent in New York may ask you to drop the pounds, but then they say in Paris that you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
In fashion groups, models and designers are always together and act as a support network at the same time.
When the Fashion Week ends, it's gonna be a bad breakup.
Models want this sector because of the opportunities it offers, but they are consumed by the fact that everyone thinks that work is just a showdown of clothes.
Models like to be their own people too.
The work makes the models feel like they're actors with a role to play.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
Models for the Tory Burch show last night.
Fashion Weeks are currently being held in New York City, where the designers will reveal their collection for next year.
Scrooge Salminen, who changed his style, plays the most unknown musician in the film, Apulanta.
Scrooge Salminen presents Antti Lautala, the founding member of the band, in a film based on the early years of the Apulanta band.
Lautala founded Apunna in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but resigned from the band in 1994.
After all, this is quite a challenge for me because I'm a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitar player, Salminen laughs.
I haven't wanted to meet the real Antti before the shoots because I want to make my own interpretation of him.
Antti is clearly the most unknown person in the group, so I think it's okay that I only learn her play style from the video.
I don't want to do a human impression.
The man who pilots the Scrooge Salminen and the Dogs band doesn't go into character.
Punk-manners come naturally with a man.
In the punk episode of the Stars and Stars program, I'm sure many people saw a foretaste, too, if they've ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been anything petty, but always going to the fullest.
During the years 1993-2004, the main actors of the "Tuukka Temonen" film, which played bass in Pupulanta, were announced today.
A core group familiar to the band's audience is still presented to the general public by quite unknown young actors.
The drummer Sipe Santa Claus is played by Teppo Manner, singer Toni from Wirta Tattu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka from Temo Iiro Panula.
Scrooge Salminen gave a tip about his future job last night when he told Snapchat mysteriously that he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Roope has already published a picture of his new look on Instagram yesterday, which he has had to make for the film.
Roope, previously seen in the mustache and jaw beard, has shaved his face to shave, and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
In recent days many parents have wondered how to tell the child about the situation of refugees seeking Europe.
Or is there any point in telling me about it?
We don't have to force this into question, a member of the SPR crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
Smaller children should be protected, for example, not allowed to watch the news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can remain in the mind and distress, he says.
However, if a child has come across television news pictures of refugees or heard from elsewhere, it is worth mentioning.
It is good to have a conversation about the child's starting point and listen carefully to what he asks.
A child's fears may be surprising.
They may not be the ones the parent imagines he is afraid of.
You don't want to scare a child in vain, even if you're distressed and scared.
A smaller child follows closely the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child too feels safe.
Bigger children are likely to come across a discussion about refugees at school, with friends or online.
Parents do well to bring it up with them if the child is concerned.
The fact is, not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents, together with children, can reflect on how we view this in our family.
In the end, though, do we feel that the world is safe or unsafe?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand: If the family also talks about difficult things, the child will have a model of how to deal with life's difficulties.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your children to help the weaker"
My powers at the end?
You can still be a good parent to your child
It's hard to control the Pallosalamaa that hits Vermo
Perttu Pohjola was able to grind Apila's Pallosalama into a blow in midsummer.
It was only making profits and second place until the end of July, the races in Tampere had collapsed.
Since the stallion was completely frozen, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered a period of time for his protégé from the vet.
The explanation for shutting down was found in the lookout.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not of the mildest end, but it took two courses of medicine to overcome it.
Since Apila's Pallosalama had to exercise lightly, Pohjola says that she is positively surprised by the horse's last run.
It was another SE mare after Taruntuuli in Turku in record time.
Apila's Pallosalama was under great pressure from the break, having been able to drive it normally for just a few weeks.
Taking those things into account, a slight bending at the end was understandable," says Pohjola.
The coach assumes that a good competition was a good thing for the Ori.
The horse's spirit certainly moved on, and I hope it would have evened out.
Apila's Ballslama has been a so-called humor horse.
When it hasn't been amused, it could have thrown fat without getting sick.
On a good day, however, the Ori has lost the kind of lightning girdle that opposers have been amazed.
At short speed, rivals can't compete with the Ballosalama, which can even deliver warm-blooded rides.
In Vermo there is a peer run in the hopes of the Nordic Region.
But the difference is how Apila's Ballsalama agrees to it.
It's pretty hard at the time of departure, and it could be under the boom of the departure car or something like that.
Hopefully the stallion will be calmer by now than Turku's leaving.
Apila's Ballsalama can also come out of the bow when it's okay, and we're gonna take it for a win, coach promise.
This is why you can't get rid of unnecessary iPhone programs.
Tim Cook, CEO of Apple.
At least some of the programs that come with Apple's iPhone phones may sometimes be removed in the future - but not all of them.
Apple will possibly delete some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future," says Tim Cook Buzzfeed, CEO of the company.
Apple's iPhone has a number of programs that are relatively few to use: FaceTime calls, Journal Kiosk, Health, Exchange, Podcasts and Tips, for example.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which entered the iPhone phones as an emergency update, although it is only necessary for Apple smart watch owners.
Cook says that removing Apple's software is more complicated than it looks.
Some apps are linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple iPhone apps work closely with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is looking into this because the company doesn't want to waste memory space on users' iPhone phones.
Inflation in the euro area dropped to 0.1 per cent in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only marginally in August, i.e. by 0.1% from one year ago, the EU statistical authority Eurostat reported today.
The rise in prices was pushed down by lower energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised its estimate of 0.2% slightly downwards from a couple of weeks ago.
In July, inflation was 0.2 per cent.
In August, so-called bottom inflation fell to 0.9% from 1.0% in July.
Eurostat's forecast for base inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Last month, energy in the euro area was 7.2 per cent cheaper than one year ago.
In the EU-28, average inflation was zero in August.
In July the rise was 0.1 per cent.
In the euro area, consumer prices rose most, or 1.4 per cent, in Malta in August.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest as prices fell by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent minus sign according to the EU Harmonised Price Index.
Inflation in the euro area remains persistently far from the European Central Bank's (ECB) target of 2% price increases in the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
Next year the increase will pick up to 1.1%, the Central Bank anticipates its new inflation forecasts released at the beginning of September.
Fed of the United States is now trying to tighten monetary policy.
The next recession in the United States will begin at its fastest in less than a year's time, but more certainly within three years after Fed's long-term interest rate rise.
And on the financial markets, the decline begins before the next recession.
Fed has hinted that he may start raising interest by this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession can hit its peak by the autumn of next year and as a financial market jam before then.
Or at least this will happen if the world's largest economy and financial markets function as they have used to - and if they react to Fed's extortion of money as they have done in the past.
Such conclusions have been drawn by the German bank Deutsche Bank's London market research strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive long-term market and economic cycle research.
The Bank distributed a Long-Term Asset Return Study report over 60 pages to its international major customers last week.
The strategists who produced the study and the report do not think they know exactly when Fed will start raising interest rates or what will happen in the economy and markets thereafter.
Instead, they use the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics to show how the economy and markets have behaved in the past during and after Fed's interest collections.
In addition to historical observations, they will look at the key variables of the economy and financial markets which are now on the same or another model as those of previous interest rates - and which may result from this.
It becomes clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a more shaky condition to withstand interest rates rising than ever before since the 1950s.
Maybe not even a year before the recession started.
The leaders who decide on Fed's monetary policy and its current stance have hinted throughout the summer and early autumn that the time is beginning to be ripe for raising interest rates.
The first increase in interest rates in over nine years can come as early as this week.
This will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed Board meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
The last time Fed raised its so-called Fed funds steering interest rate in June 2006.
That was the end of a series of relatively regular but small interest rates of 0.25 percentage points that lasted exactly two years, increasing Fed's interest rate from 1.25 to 5.25%.
The symptoms of the financial markets started in 2007 from the difficulties of the most risky housing financing in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis torn into a global doomsday nightmare.
A major recession occurred in 2009.
Last time, serious financial and real economic hardships began at a slower pace than has typically occurred since previous Fed interest collections.
Similarly, the trials were harder and harsher than ever since the recession of the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategies have been screening the rise and fall of the world's largest economies and the turn of financial markets since 1950 and in some places since the beginning of the 19th century.
Fed's interest rate increases and their economic and financial impact will be reported from the 1950s onwards.
The rate of recession has reached its fastest point in less than a year, mostly less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The rate rise on the financial markets has ended within two years of the start of Fed's interest rate withdrawals.
In turn, Fed has increased its steering interest rate by a dozen cycles of different lengths since the early 1950s.
Each time has deviated from others in some respects, and the number of times in the review is relatively limited, so they can hardly conclude anything certain about the effects of subsequent interest collections.
The strategies therefore remind us that many things are different this time.
And not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
The decisive causes of the financial crisis, let alone the culprits, may not be conclusively identified even by decades of research.
But three things about the causes which led to the crisis and which have increased its destructive power are probably somewhat indisputable:
1) In the 21st century, Fed, the euro area ECB and the rest of the world's largest central banks considered their key interest rates to be too low for too long.
They patched up the traces of the techno bubble, and then they grew the next one.
2) Over the decades, the debt accumulated and already too high in the various parts of the financial and real economy grew even more as a result of the excessive monetary policy of central banks.
The biggest debt bubble in economic history to date was created.
3) In particular, the crazy cheap debt financing, which has been packed almost without restraint in the financial economy, expanded most sectors of the financial markets' main policy bubbles from shares in real estate, bonds and commodities to date.
It is also unlikely that there will be a very strong dispute over the fact that the financial markets, which had risen to high levels, were particularly dangerous and unstable when Fed and the other central banks last pushed interest rates up.
Financial structures rigged with debt levers, let alone valuation bubbles, did not last much longer than after interest rate withdrawals had begun and debt financing costs had turned up.
The risks were realised as a result of the financial crisis, followed by a major recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
Deutsche's strategists are not guessing what will happen next, but give cause for thought by mentioning, for example:
1) Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy stance even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower for even longer.
2) Indebtedness has not been crazy cheap for a long time, as it was ten years ago, but now at its lowest price is literally cheaper than free.
As a result, the debt burden on the financial and real economy has not been reduced but now, in various parts of the economy, it is a much heavier burden than it was before or to the financial crisis.
3) The liquidity provided by the central banks, which was more concentrated and cheaper than before, has largely remained in the financial markets and has reduced key types of securities and property to the most expensive, whether at the pre-crisis peak or never.
And not only are the strategists lattice with the warning signs of the financial markets, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and decades of the worst recession to the model that has occurred in the past.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is unusually weak, but the pressures and risks of financial markets are vastly higher than before the financial crisis, when Fed next starts to tighten up its money taps.
Perhaps the picture of the future of Societe Generale's strategy, Albert Edwards, is not as strange as it may seem.
For a long time now, he has trained the Bank's international investors for the following full translations of Fed:
First Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst, and soon it's time for Fed to hurry out the financial fires with even larger QE money syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) which manufactures computers and printers will reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are directed at HP's business services, says the company.
In November, HP will be divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., which focuses on consumer pcs and printers.
HP's number of employees was highest in 2011, when it had 350,000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302,000.
The company records one-off expenses of USD 2.7 billion (about EUR 2.4 billion).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will reduce 25,000 to 30,000 employees.
The consumer-side reductions will remain at 3300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its activities to low cost countries with 60% of its employees in low cost countries in 2018.
The company says that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers will account for more than 10% of its operating results.
In the previous year, its three most significant customers brought 65 per cent of the operating result.

Yle: Minister Berner has worked on the board of the Tax Paradise Company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner has been a member of the Board of Directors of the Tax Paradise Company.
According to Yle, the company's activities involve so-called tax planning.
It is a Luxembourg company called Saltri II LuxCo, whose board member Berner was appointed in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Business Register, Berner is still an official member of the government.
Berner himself says that he submitted a resignation notice in May of this year.
I checked it out, and that's enough for me to file a notice of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration chains take place on an agreed schedule," Berner says in Yle's interview.
Membership after merger
The ownership of the Swedish company Kährs is managed through the Luxembourg company.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer who merged with Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner was a member of Karelia-Upofloor's Board of Directors in 2010-2013 and, after the merger, a member of Kährs' Board and a Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, Kährs' holdings run through a multi-tier ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted membership in the Luxembourg company at the request of Kährs' second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been on the board of Karelia-Upofloor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was asked for a partner who was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a venture investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt it was my job to take care of the benefits of the Finnish family company's capital.
It is important that we ensure that our Finnish companies' capital profits are taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context," Berner says.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's holdings in the company do not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up in the tax havens is due to the fact that Kährs' largest owner had a capital fund for ownership already in place by Triton, a Luxembourg holding company.
Espoo opens a reception centre maintained by the company
The first reception centre for adult asylum seekers is opened in Otaniemi, Espoo.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants today starting from 6 p.m.
The number of seats may increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 persons.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre in the property of the former Rescue College.
The operations are maintained by Luona Oy, whose field of activity is in particular the production of health care and medical services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy jointly agreed on security arrangements for the Centre.
STK is preparing an alternative labour blackmail package
STK will start preparing an alternative package for the government's work-related blackmails.
The organisation also wishes to include other employee centre organisations.
According to President Palola, attention is currently being paid to Friday's statement.
Alternative ways of reducing the cost of work will then be returned.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday," Palola pointed out to journalists during the meeting of the organization's administration.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) is not prepared for discussions.
STK economists have calculated that the change security of the government's competitiveness package is estimated to cost the employer EUR 30 million, compared with EUR 2 700 million on the other side of the package.
I don't know if there's a lot of enthusiasm on the part of the party to have a conversation if there's a one-to-a-hundred relationship on the side.
Palola: A constructive connection to the negotiations
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (in June) has requested alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is to submit a communication to Parliament on its own package and start preparing reforms.
Palola did not take a position on whether the timetable is realistic.
According to Palola, there is a contact with the government and it has been constructive to him all along.
According to Palola, surgery on Sundays is a painful place for the staff centre organisation STK.
The organisation requires the government to withdraw from the coercive legislation that would allow it to carry out some of the blackmails.
According to Palola, the STK does not warm up to the fact that the alternative package is being prepared with the SDP, which has been the subject of the case.
The employees meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the labour blackmail package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, the salary of the first days of illness is cut, overtime is halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
It is stressed that the central organisations have invited employees to the demonstration and that the intention has not been to organise the strike.
Akavan Fjäder says thank you
Mr Sture Fjäder, President of Akava, commends the MTK's announcement of the preparation of the alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STK now goes along with Akava, as Akava has been developing an alternative model for government performances for longer.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without SAK the package will not be comprehensive enough.
Mr Sture Fjäder, President of Akava, would like Lauri Lyly to join the SAK in preparing the proposal as an alternative to the cuts.
Earlier on Wednesday, Antti Palola's STK reported that she was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, Mr Akava announced that he had been preparing his own proposal for a long time and that he was ready to negotiate a 5% competitive jump from the country's government as an alternative to surgery.
The Akava has been ready to negotiate all along, and we have been writing an alternative model for government proposals for a long time.
We are prepared to look at the conditions of employment as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks," says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also join Akava, as STK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model for the government and employers of the country," says Fjäder.
The Akava Bureau will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
"Same boat, common coal, coyotes" - plays bingo while Sipilä speaks at night
Green Left of the University of Tampere
Viva bingo coupon for the Green Left of the University of Tampere for the evening.
In the past, Prime Ministers have made exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of Finland's economy at Yle channels on Wednesday night at 9.05 p.m.
When applying for a similar Prime Minister's previous speech, it must be 1932 when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the Prime Minister when he gave the famous radio talk that marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
The president and ministers then gave several radio talks during the winter and the follow-up war.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen used a television speech to end the strike by train operators.
A monologue, a monarchist act.
Sipilä's speech has aroused criticism and speculation all day about what is to come.
Paavo Arhinmäki, President of the Left Alliance, stated on Twitter that "Sipilä could consider his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a announcement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed."
According to the Greens Ville Niinistö, "a single phone call has already been made.
Leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
On Facebook, the SDP's Erkki Tuomioja condemned "monarchist action: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for them."
Antti Rinne, president of the SDP, challenged Sipilä to dialogue: "Soon six months after the elections.
Not a single appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
We've tried.
What are you afraid of?
Public service
According to the Prime Minister's Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it was commented live by Lauri Lyly, President of SAK and Jyri Häkämies, CEO of EK.
High has been criticized for making Sipilä's speech.
We considered the matter and stated that it is part of the public service mission to promote public access throughout Finland, a policy of Yle's Director of Publications Ismo Silvo Yle on the news.
♪ Like us in the Tammelo era ♪
The speech has also been aroused by ridicule.
When evening comes, dinner will be enjoyed well in time, the children will be combed and dressed best.
My mom puts on a prettier cripple and my dad puts on a tie around his neck.
At 9:00 a.m., we turn off the TV like we used to in the Times of the Tammelos," writes the blogger Saku Timonen.
"Will Prime Minister Sipilä also tell us in his speech why the Finnish government is sitting in tax havens with millionaires hiding their capital in order to draft amnesty laws for other tax evaders while at the same time claiming to the people that it is necessary to cut off the government when the money is gone?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
Of what Sipilä says, one guess is presented by the Green Left Viva of the University of Tampere.
On Facebook, it has published the bingo included.
Do we hear about the same boat, the same coal, living in debt and team spirit tonight?
Ready the coupons and pens, at 9.05 p.m. it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Arena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: The Western countries rejected Russia's proposal to overthrow al-Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected Russia's offer to dissuade Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power, says President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian UN ambassador proposed a plan that, after some time, al-Assad would have left power elegantly.
However, the Western countries did not take up the proposal because they believed that al-Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
In 2012, Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed three plans in a bilateral debate: no arms to the opposition, immediate contact between the opposition and al-Assad, and the abolition of al-Assad's power had to be carried out with restraint.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on all things, but we are able to have an open debate.
I told him what I was doing there and he said sit down, Martti, and I'll tell him what we have to do, Ahtisaari will remember in the Guardian interview.
The diplomats are not commenting.
Ahtisaari tells us that he sent a message from Tshurkin to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion, but according to Ahtisaari, there are no two words about it.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said that al-Assad's troops had already committed several massacres at that time, and the main opposition groups refused any agreements that would have left him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former director of the Middle East Department of the British Foreign Ministry, is hesitant about what Ahtisaari said because, according to his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest part of Ahtisaari's claim is that Tshurkin spoke under Moscow authority.
If he had told me about what Mr Tshurkin said, I would have said that I wanted to hear the same thing from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, even in that case, he would have suspected that it was Putin's trick to keep power with some supporter of Al-Assad.
The flow of refugees is what we've done.
During the negotiations of the Ahtisaari, some 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
According to UN estimates, the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have had to flee their homes because of war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own doing.
I see no alternative but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we ourselves caused," Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
Centre for the organisation of asylum seekers in Tornio
The government's plan for the organisation of asylum seekers in Northern Finland is likely to be set up in Tornio.
The center would be set up in an empty building in the city center of Tornio.
The Ministry of the Interior has sought a suitable place to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
The Helsingin Sanomat reports on Tuesday that the council had already decided to present the school building as a space solution for the Ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppinen (left), Vice-President of the City Council of Tornio, this is not true.
When the whole council was not assembled and some of the group wanted a formal decision, we decided to invite the council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he will specify to the STT.
There were 36 delegates from 43 at the conference.
Thirteen delegates were opposed to the Arrangement Centre.
Based on this, one could expect a positive decision," says Professor Hyöppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday and responded quickly.
There are an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is 200 meters from the border, so it would work in that sense too," says Nousiainen.
Sipilä still wants an alternative to blackmail from the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä, half of the holiday money in public would only cover part of the government's efforts to reduce the price of work.
However, the government will be happy to take the alternative package with him if the social partners manage to agree on it.
In Parliament Sipilä told journalists that he had not been in contact with the social partners.
He also did not know how seriously organisations were looking for compensatory measures for the blackmail of working life announced by the government.
If such an agreement arises, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä's view, halving holiday money would be a viable means, since it would target almost all employees, unlike, for example, the government's plan to cut Sunday supplements.
Labour market organisations could agree among themselves on a cut in holiday money because it is enshrined in collective agreements rather than in the law.
On Wednesday next week, the government will tell the Parliament about the tensions in working life in the form of a Government statement.
According to Sipilä, the proposals made by the organisations should be known before then.
This is not the final deadline either.
Legislative work will then start, i.e. the train will be on the move and it will become increasingly difficult.
Now's a good time.
It won't take long for things like this to happen if there's a will, Sipilä formulated.
The list published by the government last week includes, among other things, the conversion of the Epiphany and Helatorsta into unpaid holidays without shortening the annual working hours.
In addition, the salary of the first days of illness is cut, overtime is halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
Reforms are being implemented as mandatory legislation past trade unions, which has been strongly criticised.
In addition to organising a major demonstration on Friday, wage earners' associations have announced political strikes by several trade unions.
Tohmajärvi Board of Governors approved the expansion of the sap hall warehouse
The Board of Directors of Tohmajärvi unanimously approved the expansion of the warehouse of the administration of Nordic Koivu Oy, a little murmuring.
The criticism was caused by the fact that the project was bigger and more expensive than originally discussed.
Also, a busy schedule is heartbroken.
It was wondering, too, that the need for space was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this stage, stock expansion of 400-450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but the money will be decided later in the interim report.
There was still talk of an investment between EUR 150 000 and EUR 200 000 on the agenda, but at the meeting the technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it brings work and tax revenue to the local community.
The municipality has no risk since the company pays for the investment as a rental," Vesa Väistö (ps.) explained.
There is also room for Karelian language in Joensuu
The city government relaxed its earlier sharp stance on bringing street name signs in Karelian into the city center of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct in view of the maintenance of the Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of the Karelian language because there are no historical grounds for it and the Karelian language is not an inherent part of the region's identity.
The language spoken in the area of Joensuu has been more a part of the eastern savorian dialects.
After a new decision there will be no street name signs in the city center in Karelian.
However, on a case-by-case basis, the City of Joensuu is also ready to use Karelian language in information boards and tourism marketing, for example.
The same approach is recommended by the city to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, it is also worth taking a wide-ranging view of the use of Karelian language now that multiculturalism lives and changes strongly in North Karelia.
Karelian language is still a special feature of the province, as well as the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of Finland.
Both of them can well be used in the various marketing activities of the province.
Shutting down rail links reduces the vitality of the province
Train lines cuts strike the vitality of the province with a hard hand.
Transport links have a direct impact on the region's business and competitiveness.
And that affects the fact that we can live and work here at all, Joensuu Mayor Kari Karjalainen wonders.
He also raises the issue of air transport, which has also been followed up on several occasions.
It is important for the whole region that our chances are not reduced by government measures, as is happening now.
We should look at the impact of these closures on employment, for example," Karjalainen stresses.
The deterioration of transport connections poses an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better services here, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees," says Jukka Mönkkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor access also affects the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot because of research.
Recruiting Manager Marko Junkkarinen says that marketing the university towards Western Finland is already difficult because the connections are weak in the transverse direction.
About half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland currently come from outside Eastern Finland.
On the other hand, about 10-20 per cent of them are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by direct train connections.
Joensuu's one gravel sound came to your court
The view of the City Council of Joensuu on the provincial Siun sote project is seemingly unanimous, but one of the gravel sounds is.
At the board meeting on Monday, Pentti Keskisalo, a member of the City Council (sd., picture), presented a proposal to abandon the entire project, but his presentation was unsuccessful.
The Board approved a draft decision by Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be revised at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will give a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train shift from Kouvola to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger train traffic from Kotka to Kouvola will continue in the future, although less than one train crew.
There will be changes in passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One train crew misses, but still five times a day gets from Kouvola to Kouvola and vice versa.
The contractions are the result of government austerity measures.
The purchase of train transport by the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four years will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely stopped.
VR will draw up new timetables by the end of the year.
They will enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed up on the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys snuck out.
The rescue department let a 12-year-old climbing up the roof, who couldn't get off the roof on his own.
The situation arose in Tornionmäki on Ketotie at half past six on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house where there is no ladder to the roof.
It did not prevent a group of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the radio amateur mast next to it.

FedEx's net sales volatility, weaker outlook for the financial year 2016
FedEx published its weak performance in the last quarter. The transport industry left its annual performance forecast weakened due to lower demand for freight services and increased land transport costs.
The company plans to hire 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that he would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
The company's share fell by about 2.5 per cent 45 minutes before the actual trade opened on Wednesday.
FedEx's forecast is $10.40 to $10.90 for the financial year ending in May, with a decrease of 20 cents compared to the previous forecast.
According to FactSet's research, analysts predicted $ 10.84.
The forecast has deteriorated despite an average price increase of 4.9 per cent. The increases will take effect on 4 January. Additional fees for the land transport of heavy or large consignments will take effect in November.
The company still expects profit growth from the previous year due to cost cuts, higher turnover and growth in online trade.
The president and CEO, Fred Smith, stated that the company has performed well in a less favourable economic situation than expected, particularly in terms of production and global trade.
Days after the announcement by the competitor UPS of its plans to employ approximately the same number of seasonal workers as last year, i.e. between 90 000 and 95 000 people, were reported on the recruitment plans for seasonal workers.
In the quarter ending 31 August, FedEx's operating profit amounted to $692 million, representing an increase of 6%.
The result per share was $2.42 and the 12 analysts at Zacks Investment Research were left behind for the $2.44 forecast.
Net sales rose by five per cent to USD 12.3 billion.
According to six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, the turnover was expected to be 12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been hit by a decrease in international first-class transmissions, which has caused the company's Express unit to be stagnated.
The strong growth of the online store has strengthened FedEx Ground's performance.
In the last quarter, the net sales of land transport increased by 29 per cent, but the operating profit showed increased costs of large-scale transmissions and insurances.
The Express unit produced better thanks to higher basic charges, while the freight business' return decreased due to higher labour costs.
About an hour before the actual trade opened, the FedEx stock price had fallen to $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $15.15.
On Tuesday, the share ended up falling by 11 per cent from the average of the year and 17 per cent below the highest quotation recorded on 11 June.
This week the Fed decision-makers of the Federal Reserve will meet for the most anticipated meeting in years, and the crowd will sit down at a wooden table of eight metres in diameter in Hondurans to decide whether it is time to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
On the wall of the central bank's decorative two - story meeting room is a wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the financial interests of the State must be placed above all other interests by the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen and his colleagues.
The Central Bank has a double order from Congress: maximize employment in the United States and keep prices stable here.
However, since the Great Depression, the central bank's management has taken note of the third unwritten mandate: economic stability.
On Thursday, the Central Bank is to announce whether the U.S. economy is ready to start rehab from the unpredictable stimulus offered by short-term interest rates that have remained close to zero in the end of 2008.
While most data show a steady economic growth, recent turmoil in financial markets can make officials of a prudent central bank startle the increase in volatility by raising the reference rate for federal taxes - even by one percentage point per quarter.
"The labour market and inflation are, of course, the first and most important in their practical monitoring," says Lindsey M. Piegza, Chief Economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I believe that if the Central Bank is looking for an excuse not to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty in the global market is giving enough reason to wait yet," Piegza continues.
Those who think about it do not agree with what the Central Bank is doing, which in itself is causing nervousness.
About half of economists in the Bloomberg study were anxious to raise interest rates this week.
However, in the financial markets, the central bank is expected to wait and the main indicator suggests that there is only a 30% possibility of withdrawal.
If the central bank raises its key interest rate, stock prices may fall unless decision-makers soften the impact by promising a second withdrawal.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average defected 228.89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16 599.85.
"The fall was due to the expectation that the central bank would keep the interest rate stable this week," said John Lonski, chief economist of the Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the central bank raised interest rates at this stage," he said.
"If this were to happen, the Central Bank would have to consider carefully how to keep financial market participants without shaking their hands."
Secondly, the experts stated that raising interest rates could calm the financial markets and eliminate uncertainty as to when the central bank will operate.
Only a month ago, the Central Bank seemed to have increased interest rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, which would be the first small step towards tightening the financial conditions and thereby strengthening the recovery of the United States.
Yellen has said that throughout the spring and early summer she has been waiting for higher interest rates this year - despite the fact that the Liberals say that economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, which is now at its lowest level in seven years and close to the level which the Central Bank will reduce to full employment.
Looks like your paycheck is picking up.
Although inflation continued to fall below the central bank's annual target of 2%, the central bank decision-makers noted that the main reason for this was the temporary impact of oil prices.
"The economy can cope with higher interest rates and needs them as long as they take account of the tight labour market situation," said Pantheon Macroeconomics' chief economist Ian Shepherdson.
However , the financial markets throughout the world were not startled last month when China devaluations its currency.
Dow Jones industrial average dropped by up to 16 percentage points from the record height of May and investors feared that the decline in the Chinese economy would also affect global growth.
The market has picked up this month, and Dow Jones has already fallen by almost 10% from the peak of May.
The turmoil in the market means that the central bank's decision-makers are becoming even more complicated to reflect on the increase in the interest rate.
"The work of the Central Bank is becoming more complicated despite what happened on the financial markets and the news of the deterioration of the Chinese economy in recent weeks," said UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, Senior Researcher and former Central Bank official Stephen D. Oliver.
Now he thinks the Central Bank will wait at least a month to deal with the effects.
"There is a great deal of uncertainty about what will have an impact on the US economy. There is little reliable information on the situation since recent developments in the Chinese economy," said Oliver.
Restoring the world economy is not the central bank's main concern, so in principle it should not affect the decision-making of the central bank.
In practice, however, the Central Bank is the most influential currency in the world.
The impact of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years.
In 2013, a mere hint from then President Ben S. Bernanken that the central bank could narrow down the scale of its operations caused upheavals around the world.
In today's world, markets and economies are closely interlocked. In addition to monitoring global developments, the central bank is also required to communicate with other central banks and experts to provide a good overview of the global economy.
"The decision-making process of the Central Bank is more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, Director of the Global Strategy of Envestnet Inc.
President Jeffrey Lacker of Richmond's regional central bank said this month that the Central Bank has previously overreacted to financial market movements that do not seem to be linked to basic economic pillars.
Mr Laker, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, has called for an increase in the steering interest rate, as an example of the decisions taken in 1998 and 1999.
"The Asian economic crisis led to the Central Bank's decision at three meetings to reduce the key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points, even though only limitedly identifiable sanctions were available for economic growth in the United States," said Laker.
One year later, the Central Bank annulled the decision.
"The Central Bank should give priority to monetary stability only in a major crisis, such as the collapse of the 2008 economy," said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England Interest Committee.
The latest turmoil doesn't even draw close to the situation at the time," he said.
"There is absolutely no reason to be afraid of raising the heels because of the upset in the market," added Peterson Institute for International Economics Posen.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate, and it does not mention monetary stability; until this change comes, I do not think we should take precedence."

Brazil's Rio Grande Children's Association promotes a proper diet for lactating people
Brazil's Rio Grande Children's Association, SPRS, has developed a blinding way to teach breast-feeding women the meaning of a proper diet. They are presented with pictures of babies sucked from breasts painted with pictures of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk is made up of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, so that the baby gets all the food it needs and can develop a strong immune system.
Because of extra energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 kilo calories.
According to a new study, additional changes to diet should be made in addition to increasing calorie levels.
A recent study by Professor Robert Waterland of Baylor College of Medicine in Texas revealed that a healthy diet of pregnant women can affect the baby's genes and protect the baby from tumour development.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise has the biggest audience, even though Nine is trying to get the lead on his Today Show.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson went to Canberra to do a morning show on the aftermath of the Liberal Party elections, but this did little to improve Today's ratings.
The morning program for the Nine Channel was broadcast from the capital after Malcolm Turnbull had taken Tony Abbott out of town.
David Koch and Samantha Armytage piloted the morning program of a rival channel from London. Special broadcasts of a week's duration are also broadcast from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
Apparently, the distance did not matter to Australian television viewers, since Sunrisea was looking at an average of 397 000 viewers in five state capitals, while Today's programme was available to 339 000 viewers.
Today's ratings rose slightly compared to last Monday (317,000) and Tuesday (283000), but remained reading last Thursday (343,000).
Today's been catching up with Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, Today had an average of 318 000 viewers, Sunrisen 330 000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
In September, Sunrise has reached an average of 349 000 admissions and Today 314 000 admissions.
This is the most interesting event all morning.
Changes in winds will have more impact on Parliament this morning.

Seven had 800 Words news series with the former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama tells of a recently widowed father who decides to move to New Zealand with his two children. The new series reached a staggering 1,219,000 admissions.
The critics have been questioning whether Thomson would be enough to be the star of a hit show alone, without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
According to last night's ratings, the answer is clearly positive.
Seven's The X Factor maintained its strong position with 1 136 000 spectators, and the series was a bright defeat for The Block (838 000) and TBL's Families series (726 000).
Seven's The Chase Australia has captured audiences in varying degrees.
Andrew O'Keefe's first half of the new game series (17.00-17.30) followed an average of 446 000 admissions.
During the second half hour (17.30-18.00), the audience rose to 623 000, which was more than Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613 000).
On Monday evening, the Chase Australia's first half had an average of 520 000 admissions, and the second half gathered a huge 720 000 admissions.
Hot Seat's number was 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second night ratings showed the Nine channel that Hot Seat will pass by another 5:30.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minite, who was unable to challenge McGuire's series.

The final three thinks Sam Wood really is the Bachelor of Dreams, but who does he choose?
Did the secret come out?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly exposed the choice of Bachelor of Dreams.
The final choice of Bachelor Sam Wood has been a carefully preserved secret.
Three remaining women won't say a word about who's got the last rose from the bachelor.
We asked about the moods of Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows before they dropped one of the trio, and the women could inadvertently insinuate who would be the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are tightly sealed until Thursday's finals.
All three women were glowing that Wood was the perfect man. Women praised his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity and considered him to be a match for themselves.
When the women were asked who would be the most suitable companion for Wood if the last rose did not hit their own spot, their answers could give an indication of who would take the bachelor's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay after themselves as the most suitable partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been going very well since the beginning.
"The moment I came into the house, I noticed that Sarah and Sam fit well together. This feeling has survived throughout the program," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah has legs on the ground, and she's very funny company," Markoski added.
"I've seen them together, and I have to admit there's chemistry between them.
They seem like a natural couple.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood are a good couple.
Mackay told me he realized on last week's hometown date that Wood could be the one.
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this isn't just a race. I'm gonna bet on our relationship," Mackay said.
When Mackay was asked who Wood should choose if he didn't choose him, she answered with mystery:
"I can't say," he said.
"I like other girls just as much. Snezana and Lana are even."

Jarryd Hayne has several options for starting a NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hayne after she moved to the United States. Several other clubs also became interested in him after the impressive open day of practice last year.
Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsula, and the choice seems to have hit the button.
Some coaches would have kept Hayne on the bench, as the man was in the ranks of the Australian rugby team. Hayne fucked up after the kickback team scored 20-3 on Tuesday from Minnesota.
Tomsula, however, showed that she trusted Hayne and gave him another chance to return the flight kick. Coach kept Hayne in the game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula also continued in the locker room after the game.
He didn't crawl in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also defended Hayne publicly at the post-game press conference.
49ers specialist Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget the failed capture and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne is screwing up the first quarter of the game against Minnesota Vikings.
Hayne and her Australian fans had expected something else from the man's NFL debut.
Hayne left the airport after failure raining and later told Hamish and Andy about the 2DayFM 104.1 channel that he could not have imagined a worse start for his NFL career.
"These things happen and we have to move on," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the error to her debut in the State of Origin series in 2007, when her pass in her own area opened up a place in Queensland.
Overall, the experience was still incredible for a 27-year-old boy.
On Instagram, Hayne published a picture of her posing together with fans and Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussing gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at gunpoint at an airport in Siberia.

Four dead policemen shot with rubber bullets protestors in Nepal
Four people died in South Nepal, a source of authority told me on Wednesday, and the police fired rubber bullets at a mob in a protest against the country's alleged new constitution, including a four-year-old son.
The violence occurred on Tuesday evening in the Rupandeh region, less than 300 kilometers from the capital of Kathmandu.
According to district chief Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, more than 1,000 protesters had been gathered outside the police station, some of them tossing stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal told me that the police used tear gas and fired into the air before the rubber bullets were shot.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded.
It is not quite clear why rubber bullets, which can kill but are generally considered a less destructive alternative, were suddenly so deadly.
This was the latest confrontation in weeks of protests in the southern plains of Nepal, where, according to the Madhesi tribe, the new provinces based on the new constitution would weaken their political influence.
Protests have also been seen in West Nepal, where the Tharus tribe demands its own state.
At least 40 people, 11 of whom are police officers, have died in violent conflicts since 10 August,
when the four major political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into provinces, an important step towards a new constitution, but the subject is very sensitive in Nepal, where the regime has been centralised for centuries.
The new Constitution has been working since 2008, but the legislative process accelerated the process after thousands of people died in the shocking earthquake in April.
The legislators have voted on the constitutional clauses in Katmandu this week, and according to the authorities, the new charter could be adopted by Sunday.
NHC Hurricane Centre: 60% probability for cyclon south of Cape Verde
Within a wide area of low pressure, about 560 km from the southernmost parts of the Cape Verde Islands, a tropical cyclon can develop in the next 48 hours, reported the National Hurricane Center of the United States on Tuesday.
According to the Miami Meteorological Institute, there is also a clear low pressure center in the middle of Cape Verde and the Small Antilles, and it can also develop into a tropical cyclon in the next two days.
Google plans to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced the launch of a campaign to raise USD 11 million for humanitarian aid organisations helping thousands of people fleeing war and poverty across Europe.
Google announced a donation campaign on his blog in a particularly personal way.
Instead of leadership, the campaign was launched by Google's employee Rita Masoud, who was only seven years old when she fled Kabul with her family.
"We traveled in the dark by train and bus and experienced hunger, thirst, cold and fear," Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
Following the escalation of the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe, many families in a similar situation desperately need help.
Donations are addressed to non-profit organisations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children's Association and the UN Refugee Organisation.
When donations have been collected at Google.com/refugeelief via $5.5 million, Google promises to donate an equivalent amount, thus reaching the total amount of $11 million.
The European refugee crisis is at its worst since the Second World War, which is particularly exacerbated by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has caused more than four million people to flee their homes this year.
The war will also have to flee Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Mildly overweight diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery
According to a new study, mildly overweight type 2 diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether mildly overweight type 2 diabetics live longer after obesity surgery than those receiving non-operative treatment.
"It takes time to get the death data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on obesity surgery, who discussed a new study in JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery reduces the stomach by different methods.
Surgical methods reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food in the body.
During the years, Baratric surgery has been shown to be effective in type 2 diabetes. However, the majority of the studies have been conducted with morbidly overweight persons with a body mass index (BMI) of at least 35.
Body mass index indicates the weight/length ratio of normal value between 18,5 and 24,9.
When the body mass index is above 25, the person is overweight and the body mass index above 30 indicates significant obesity.
You can calculate your own body mass index at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In a new study, researchers at the hospital in Min-Sheng, Taiwan, used data collected since 2007 in a study comparing two obesity surgery methods, gastric bypass surgery and sleeve surgery, to medicines for type 2 diabetes in mildly obese individuals.
After obesity surgery, the average body mass index decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of study.
The body mass index of those who received non-operative treatment remained close to 29.
In surgery patients, diabetes was fully improved by 36% and partly by 28%.
In the drug-treated group, the overall improvement in diabetes was only 1% and in part only about 2%.
The study also showed that blood pressure, triglycerides and severe LDL cholesterol were better in the surgical arm.
Researchers also monitored patients' haemoglobin levels of A1c, which reflects the development of blood sugar levels.
According to researchers, the recommended haemoglobin level of A1c is less than 7%.
After surgery, the mean reduction in haemoglobin-A1c was from 9% to 6%.
In the drug treatment group, the value remained unchanged at around 8%.
However, a study group led by Dr Chih-Cheng Hsu concluded that this did not reduce mortality over five years.
The study group also compared the consequences of two different methods of surgery.
During the fifth year, weight loss was greater in the gastric bypass group compared to the sleeve surgery group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), the body mass index drop was higher (74 and 5.1), as well as the haemoglobin levels of A1c (3.1% and 2.1%), while in the bypass surgery group, diabetes was fully improved by a higher proportion (46.9%) and 16.7%.
The new study failed to show lower mortality after five years. However, according to a Swedish study by the University of Phoenix of Arizona College of Medicine in Blackstone, surgery brings life years to fat people.
In a Swedish study, the incidence of mortality in obese individuals undergoing gastric bypass surgery was reduced by 29% over a period of 15 years compared to the traditional treatment group.
Although no lower mortality was observed in the new study, Blackstone argued that it was confirmed that persons with a BMI below 35 could benefit from the measure.
"This is the most important discovery of the study, as it states that surgery is safe in a lower body mass index group and does not increase the risk of death or kidney disease," Blackstone wrote.
According to Blackstone, people and doctors should take weight seriously when the body mass index is 27-30.
"We wait too long for people to take the situation seriously," said the researcher.
"When genetic changes have accumulated in the human body that predispose you to obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation."
"Not everyone can come to Europe" Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is not in a position to receive all refugees, the Dalai Lama has said: the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has called for an end to violence in the refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the refugee crisis during his visit to the United Kingdom. The Dalai Lama addressed the Dalai Lama at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, focusing on ethical research.
According to the Dalai Lama, in the current situation, humanity must take precedence over individual countries or continents.
He also stressed that although the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is not enough in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," said the Dalai Lama in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama commended the efforts made by Germany and Austria in the event of a crisis, he stressed that the solution was only temporary.
"Wording for thousands of refugees is a wonderful act, but at the same time long-term solutions need to be considered and how we can achieve genuine peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education," stressed the Dalai Lama.
"In the end, we need to consider how we can reduce the number of killings in these countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
Powers have never solved problems," he added.
Speaking of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions in connection with the terrorist attacks of 11 September and claimed that the United States, in responding to the terrorist attack, brought about an uncontrolled chain of events.
"After the attacks of 11 September, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution would come through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he resorted to force with unpredictable consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Swallowing cases quadrupled in children in four years
According to Georgia's poison center, poisoning centers across the United States report nearly quadruple cases of ingestion with high levels of alcohol in children under 12 years of age since 2010.
According to Gaylord Lopez, head of the Georgia poison center, the cases of hand-in-hand ingestion reported to poison centers in children under 12 years of age increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"These products are increasingly accessible to children, and unfortunately some of the children have to go to emergency care," Lopez told CNN.
According to Lopez, children drink handicrafts on purpose, some to impress their friends and some incited by social media.
YouTube videos show teenagers drinking disinfectant because of cheap hops.
Teenagers are reported to mix alcohol - rich mouthwash with disinfectant to make the drink stronger.
Smaller children can be attracted by the scent of handdrops.
"The kid doesn't think it's bad," Lopez said.
"Most of your attractive handicraft products are just scented.
Strawberry, grape and orange-flavored handicrafts are available that appeal to children'.
The alcohol content of the disinfectants is between 45% and 95%.
A small number of small children can cause alcohol poisoning.
"The alcoholic strength of Käsides is very high," Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Kansas University Hospital Poison Center, told Fox 4 channel in Kansas City.
"No one would leave a whiskey shot within the reach of children, but if hand disinfectants are often left within the reach of children, they will quickly obtain a high amount of alcohol."
Six - year - old Nhaijah Russell recently enjoyed four rhymes of strawberry-scented handicrafts at school, and the girl was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
"The girl's blood alcohol level was 179, which is twice the adult's hops limit," says Dr. Chris Ritchey of the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Nhaijah was unable to walk when he was brought to the emergency room.
The doctors followed the girl's condition overnight in a separate children's hospital for brain damage, as she had fallen and hit her head after drinking alcohol," Ritchey said.
"The situation was really scary," Nhaijah's mother Ortoria Scott said to CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products and alcohol wipes in addition to the need to remove your hands from children's reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two ontarian women died from ingestion of handicraft containing a toxic substance that had not been reported.
The health authorities thought that the product contained deadly methanol instead of ethyl alcohol, although the latter has been reported as active substance in the product leaflet.
According to the police report, three fourth - grade students in the northern part of New York State planned in January to kill a "evil" teacher by placing antibacterial products all over the classroom.
The teacher is very allergic to handicrafts and forbidden it to be brought into the classroom.
The police considered that the plan that went down was meaningless and called for disciplinary action in school.
Rumor mill: no discord in the Celtic ranks
Griffith minimizes the discord of the Celtic team, while Deila admits that the team isn't doing well, but she thinks she can fix it.
Hearts buttons against SFA for Neilson's punishment, and Warburton will watch out for January player transfers so that team unity will not suffer.
Aberdeen's neck for Celtic five points.
The punishment of ADAM Rooney's first half brought Aberdeen a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium. The victory raised Aberdeen's five-point escape from Celtic.
Griffiths minimizes discord.
Griffiths has ignored the rumours of disunity in the Celtic ranks. According to his own words, Griffiths and his team are not being watched as they prepare to meet the Dutch serial leader.
"I don't think we're under any pressure. I think the players are waiting to meet.
The Dutch miss the old Scottish couple - de Boer
Former Rangers middle field player and Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer have concluded that Dutch football fans have stopped interested in Celtic because they are no longer allowed to follow Celtic and Rangers' duels.
De Boer, a member of the team of Ajax's team, said: "There are no more Celtic highlights in Holland. Why?
Because the Rangers are no longer involved."
"We don't just talk about Rangers coming back here.
They're talking about the Old Firm.
The Dutch need a team-to-team duel.
Old Firm's games have a huge amount of tension and are also of interest beyond Scotland's borders."
I'm gonna turn the situation around, Deila's gonna convince me.
RONNY Deila admits that Celtic is having a difficult time, but the Norwegian pilot assures us that there will be a change in the situation.
The company that lost to Malmö fell from the Champions League and lost ten players to Aberdeen, who now has a five-point lead at the top of the table.
"Celtic has had difficult episodes before, and we will rise again," Deila said.
"We want to improve our situation as quickly as possible.
The situation is so frustrating and arouses hatred or grief in many people.
So do we, but we have to move on.
We urgently need the support of the Celtic supporters, which will strengthen the players considerably.
Together life is really important now."
Warburton cautious in January player transfers
Although only a few weeks ago, the Rangers boss, Mark Warburton, hinted at the January player transfer targets, he is cautious about the transfer rollins and says that he wants to jeopardize the team's unity.
"The January player transfers differ significantly from summer transfers," Brentford's ex-coach said.
"Players joining the team in the summer can be used to getting used to the team before the start of the season, which this season has been successful in our composition.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes unnecessary player purchases can cause the team more harm than good."
Michu, who is looking for Celtic's objective retirement.
Swansea's attacker Michu has been linked to Celtic in player transfer talks. Michu, on the other hand, has implied retirement after the end of the Swans agreement.
Twenty-nine-year-old Michu has been plagued by an angry ankle for years, and he failed to get a transfer from Wales in the summer.
Hearts ready for SFA on Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field. The team finally lost 3-2. The defender's red card was later revoked. This is already the third Collum red card within eight months, which will be revoked.
But Neilson stays behind what he said. "I didn't question honesty. I didn't comment on performance.
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle.
Griffiths was rebuked for admitting that he had been slandering songs from a former Hearts player named Rudi Skaceli.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Edinburgh Roseburn area before the Edinburgh local match in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"There was a local match coming, and the atmosphere was intense," the attacker said. "I can guarantee I won't go back to Tynecastle except in the Celtic ranks."
Tannadice's management team believes in Dundee United's coaching leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly assures us that Dundee United's leadership team can make things better and that extradition on the ground is no longer permitted.
"Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready for the fight," Donnelly said.
McInnes is satisfied with Hamilton victory with a dirty game
Derek McInnes admits that Aberdeen had to endure desperately against Hamilton in the face of his seventh consecutive league victory, winning Aberdeen's five-point neck at the top of the Celtic serial table, thanks to Adam Rooney's punishment in the first half.
"There is no cup or league winning team that would not have won such games," McInnes said.
Unemployment unchanged in Scotland, growing in the British Isles
The number of unemployed remained unchanged in Scotland between May and July. There are 164 000 unemployed. In the United Kingdom as a whole, the number of unemployed increased by 10 000 at the same time.
According to the United Kingdom Statistics Office for National Statistics, the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9%, compared with 5.5% in the United Kingdom as a whole.
There are 12 000 fewer people working in Scotland than three months earlier; the number of people working now is 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0% in the quarter, with the United Kingdom as a whole having an average employment rate of 73.5%.
Scottish Minister David Mundel commented on recent figures: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for a strong economy."
Almost exactly a year ago, Scotland made an historic decision to survive as part of the United Kingdom.
The labour market situation in Scotland has improved over the past year: unemployment has fallen.
Why am I following an execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, if there is no legal basis for withdrawal, I will follow the execution.
If the execution is carried out, which I do not wish, I will sit in the execution room of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary while Richard Glossip is executed with a poison injection.
Glossip has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses.
In January, I received an invitation through a man's best friend and despite my shock, I answered yes.
As the day approaches, I'm terrified.
Then why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought that this is how I could tell the true story of the death sentence.
The angle would be unique.
Journalists will be able to follow executions in the United States and, since there are more applications than places, the participants will be selected with a macabre prize.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of journalists from 12 to 5.
The chosen follow the execution with moderation.
I can't do it.
I'm sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends and I've created a personal relationship with him because we've been on the phone several times over the months, and one of my visits took two and a half hours.
I like this man.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
Prison staff say I can't be present as both a witness and a reporter, so I'm not allowed to bring a notebook and a pen to make notes.
All I have to do is try to memorize the details.
A reporter from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of endangering neutrality.
"The basic idea is this:
When you tell a condemned story in a way that pleases him, you get close to him."
I gave the reporter my disagreement.
The reporter woman admitted that she could have worded her words more carefully, but still felt that my actions were wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he tried to tell me what to do, I wouldn't do what he says.
I've told him that he can remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to write about what happened.
If Glossip dies, he'll believe that publicity will promote a movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware from the Huffington Post will be sitting next to me.
If you want more information on the subject, you can listen to my podcast.
I am not going to repeat the details in this context.
I can't tell you Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of aid after the crime.
I believe, however, that it is very likely that the man Glossip has not committed murder.
I firmly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I believe his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I will follow his execution.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
An unbiased description can be read in other reporters' cases.
I'll tell you what it's like to watch a man die in vain.
The man was lured from the Canning River after a watery police chase.
Canning Vale area officer remained dry while luring a man up the Canning River.
The Perthian man's escape attempt shoved him into a shallow muddy water, and a policeman a few yards away got the man grounded back on dry land.
Canning Vale PD got a call on Tuesday about an unauthorized stay in Beckenham.
Upon arriving, the police found a suspect who tried to lose the police by heading for the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"The man standing in the water said he wouldn't come out of the water and tell the police to get him in the water," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec wasn't tempted to water his uniform, so he chose a safer tactic - a negotiation.
"Sometimes an attempt to escape makes a person resort to amusing means," said Sergeant Castledine.
The case of football champion Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid the police blowing and tried to swim across the Swan River.
The man's attempt was doomed, but the rapture inspired the locals to design Ben Cousins Biathlon.
According to Peter Moody, the officials tried to spy on him, and he threatened to stop competing.
Peter Moody blames Racing Victoria's operatives for trying to spy on him last year, and he threatened to stop competing immediately.
Moody claims that the officials and Racing Victoria's integrity department have attacked him personally, and the rejection of Lady Tatai for treatment recently given on the day of the race was the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he'd always tried to work for racing, and Moody's gotten into a difficult situation when they found cobalt in Lidar's sample, and he couldn't explain the discovery.
Moody has kept his tongue in check for a year and a half on espionage charges, and he didn't want them to seem like the actions of a bitter man.
"I wasn't going to raise the issue, but I thought about it for a long time, but sometimes frustration breaks out at once," Moody said.
"They know what really happened."
"Sometimes I have to react and accept the consequences. I now have to accept the condition after I opened my mouth.
I'm gonna go home and sleep well tonight.
I want to go upright, and I want the owners of the horses to think I'm doing the best I can.
If the owners don't believe it, I don't think I should continue as a horse coach anymore.
I'd have to think about my future as a licensed coach."
Moody dropped the bomb earlier in an interview with Racing.com, where he told me about the espionage efforts in the integrity department at his stable.
"Fifteen years ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered a man a job in my stable to spy on me. I'll tell him his name on request," Moody said to Racing.com.
"They clearly believe I'm a fraud.
If so, they should present the evidence, for I have not been apprehended from anything unauthorized.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, current Chairman of the RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of the action then and now.
Should I view the situation as a personal pursuit?
Should the RVL take real action and place responsibility for the situation in the sector on non-coachers?
Do you think I'm bad for the business?
Am I really bad for the business?
Maybe that's what a lot of people think.
Maybe I'll still have a training license and push me away from my assignments... and I'll make a lot of people feel that way when I talk to them.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore.
It's really sad.
I'm putting pressure on them to make a decision.
My family supports me, and I can withdraw."
The long - lasting examination of Lidar's cobalt values and the recent rejection situation finally frustrated the coach so that he threatened to give up his license.
Moody is best known as the coach of the unbeatable champion Black Caviar, who described the day-to-day rule as ridiculous after the horse's feet had been wrapped with clay in violation of the rules.
"The treatment is against the rules.
I take full responsibility for it," Moody said.
"A person from my staff misplaced clay on a horse's leg.
We could've done the marijuana last night.
It could have been done yesterday afternoon, and that's what happened.
But it happened on the day of the race."
Moody can expect a three-month non-compete ban on non-compliant clay treatment, which has been investigated by organizers.
"This is a joke.
The rules have been drawn up by someone who doesn't know horses at all.
Everyone understands that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Arrested on the scene of a Cobram crash.
The police have arrested a cyclist who ran away from the crash site this weekend.
The biker was taken by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital, where he suffered severe injuries after the car hit him on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
According to the police, the man driving the car fled the scene and didn't stay behind to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported to the Shepparton police.
A man is likely to be facing charges of failure to comply with the obligations of stopping and assisting in a traffic accident and other traffic offences.
A 40-year-old cyclist from Cobram is still in hospital and is stable.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy refers to opponents' wrestling speeches.
Craig Bellamy, Melbourne Storm's coach, sees the criticism of his team's tackle game as a purpose-oriented action for the two league favorites of the NRL.
According to coach Trent Robinson of Sydney Roosters, the judges let Storm wrestle to the detriment of the Melbourne hosts in a qualifying match in Sydney on Friday night.
Coach Wayne Bennett of Brisbane Broncos barely covered up the reference to Storm after Broncos won the qualifying final on Saturday night at Queensland Cowboys. He called the game a model match and said that there was no special interest in wrestling in Queensland.
Bellamy defended his own team's hit-and-run game and said they just focused on contact when they tackled it.
Bellamy added that his confidence in his own team was increased by the fact that two top team coaches criticized his team. Bellamy considers this to be an indication that the coaches are concerned about losing to Storm.
"This thing always comes up. As I recall, Trent Robinson didn't say anything about wrestling when his team beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I guarantee you that we haven't changed anything in our defense system or techniques all year long, and for the past six weeks, we've just been investing in contact games and tackles, which has turned us up.
Trent's been on his mission for three years, and it could have been a shock to him because he's got a great team that's not used to losing.
It is amusing that the same thing always comes up at the same time of the year.
Bellamy didn't agree with Bennett about what was interesting football and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010 by playing boring football.
"Wayne talks about interesting football.
He compared his team to our game on Saturday and found their game interesting," Bellamy said.
"In 2010, St George received a lot of criticism about his boring game. Wayne said that the review didn't give him a hint.
Now he has a team that is able to play so-called football, especially his young, fast centers.
That's the kind of football you wanna play when the gamer arsenal is like this.
He emphasized this in 2010. Now he wants everyone to play in his style. Not all teams have centers like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
This gives me more confidence when other coaches are so worried about meeting my team that they're gonna resort to this.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think they'd meet us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that in Storm and Roosters, more goals were scored than in Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game. I haven't seen it, but what was the result? 16-12?
The end result of our game was 20-18. There were more situations in our game, but is it interesting football?
Or is it an interesting soccer game?
I think the goals make it interesting.
If they mention us, we'll probably face them."
Storm has a free weekend because the team will be invited to visit either North Queensland Cowboys' Cronu at AAMI Park on the next Saturday at Sharks. Tickets will be available on Tuesday morning.
A Serbian man released on $200,000 bail in a drug case.
A man waiting for a life sentence for an attempt at possession of 40 kg of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on bail of $200,000.
Marko Maximovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after the police found a 100 kg shipment of cocaine on the Solay ship, which had come through Vanuatu from South America and arrived at Coomera Port in August.
The police watched the meeting of Maximovic and his accomplice at the marina for the morning and later surprised the two at the Coomera Roadhouse café. A 40-pound shipment of drugs was found in the Toyota Echo car in the parking lot.
Although Maximovic may be facing life imprisonment for possession of a drug for commercial purposes, according to his lawyer, there is no evidence that his client tried to take possession of the whole batch but could have been in a café for an innocent purpose.
According to Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan, there is a risk that Maximovic will try to escape the country.
"Maksimovic has clear links with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," the judge said in court on Wednesday.
"He lied to the police about where he lived."
Maximovic's mother and stepfather together paid 200 000 bail against which a man was released.
"After reading the sworn certificates of both persons, it is clear that $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," stated Judge Flanagan.
"But that alone is not enough to stop a man from fleeing," the judge warned.
Maximovic was released on condition that he surrenders both Australia and Serbia's passport, reports to the police daily and stays home from 6 a.m. to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used her phone to get the pedophiles to send pictures.
The pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to take over pictures of children being abused.
Stevan Hogg took the phone while the girl was sleeping and logged in to an online message service where he got another user to send himself inappropriate pictures of the children.
Later, when she woke up, she noticed that her phone was missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
Exploring the contents of her phone, she found shocking messages and immediately told her mother.
These five photos were reported to the police. After examining the computers found at the address, the police found disturbing Internet searches using search words to search for inappropriate child images.
Hogg claimed to the police that he was trying to mislead paedophiles on the Internet and that he was pretending to be a cop with the aim of scaring paedophiles.
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson said in the local courthouse at Dundee Sheriff Court: "The man claimed to be dependent on intimidation of people.
He admitted that he had done the searches on the computer, but claimed to have done so to impersonate the police and thus to intimidate the paedophiles.
Hogg was asked about conversations with an unknown person who had sent the photos to him and from whom Hogg had asked for more pictures.
Hogg claimed that his purpose was to mislead the paedophiles.
He said he had some disturbing thoughts while drinking and wanted to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added: "When she found the messages on the phone, she cried out to her mother, shaking and crying."
She saw the inappropriate photos on the phone, and then Hogg got interrogated.
The girl told me that the accused used a computer and a Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than themselves.
The 23-year-old Hogg Dundeen from Ward Road confessed to the charges of possession of improper child images on 14 June last year. Hogg broke bail on 25 January this year and failed to appear in court on 24 March this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be placed in the register of sex offenders because it could be considered that the crime did not contain any significant sexual features.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence until October due to background social work reports.
Hogg was granted an exemption on bail in this case but was held in custody on other grounds.
Hogg was added to the sex offenders' register even before the day of the verdict.
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe gives the wrong speech in Parliament
The oldest head of state in Africa, Mugabe, fell on the stairs leading to the podium earlier this year.
Mugabe was not injured, but the video of what happened spread rapidly on social media.
Parliament's opening ceremony was also overshadowed by allegations made by opposition party legislators that they received anonymous death threats warning them not to boo Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, MPs booed and interrupted a speech in Parliament on the situation of the President's state, and the President gave the same speech on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, the Bishop of the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change), noted that seven opposition politicians received text messages inviting them not to interfere with Mugabe's speeches.
"The message has been sent from an unknown number, but the title of the message is "death," Gonese told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
The message warns recipients that outside Parliament representatives are no longer subject to immunity.
According to the party whisperer, the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is concerned about threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard intends to reduce 25 000 to 30 000 jobs as part of the restructuring and austerity measures of the business service business.
HP is divided into two listed companies later this year and separates the computer and printer business from the faster growing business hardware and service activities.
According to HP's bulletin, the company will record one-off expenses of $2.7 billion starting from the fourth quarter.
"The new arrangements will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, CEO of HP, who will run the company after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more focused company than the current HP, and we have extensive and deep portfolio business operations that will help companies move into a new business style." Whitman said.
"As a company, our position is better than ever and we are better able to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual turnover is over USD 50 billion and, according to its mission, the company focuses on delivering unique integrated technology solutions to companies.
The company founded in the 1930s by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, raised by Stanford University, is now divided in two. The two established an electronics company in a garage in Palo Alto, which is now considered the birthplace of Silicon Valley.
Massive reorganisations have been carried out in HP when the transition from traditional desktop computers to mobile devices is underway.
Changes in the world's second largest computer manufacturer and HP, one of the largest technology companies in the United States, are the latest moves in a sector where it is believed that concentration will bring success.
Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta: The team must support injured Jack Wilshere before meeting Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is only September. If everything goes well with the rehabilitation plan, there is no reason why he should not return to the field by December.
The best scenario is that Wilshere will certainly have to miss at least the next four England national team games. Knowing his history, his participation in the European Championship is clearly unclear.
The most recent problem is that Wilshere decided strongly after the ankle injury of last season and seemed to have returned to its former blade under the new season.
"This kind of injury doesn't threaten a career," Wenger said.
"The bone didn't heal properly.
It's not a serious injury.
This was just an accident.
It had nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries."
Medically, this may be the case, but as Wenger also pointed out, further injuries can occur when a player tries to return to the field during the season.
Here, too, there is an unpleasant rule of conduct.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different troubles since Wilshere debuted six years ago.
He also played in the Arsenal ranks in only 65 of 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The larger picture of Arsenal is that since the 2007-2008 season, six of the eight seasons, the team has been the second of the teams that lost the most money due to injuries.
Wenger accepts a potential vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that last season's improved injury statistics continue to improve.
"Sometimes the return after injury may involve a vulnerable period in which the body needs to be strengthened and competitive advantages sought," said Wenger.
"Jack's young, so he'll get through this.
I hope he can balance his body, and I believe in it, and with it his career will continue as he deserves."
Arsenal will start the Champions League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb. After that, the team will meet Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur on the next Wednesday. Wenger will prepare minor changes to the lineup.
Since Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, Mathieu Debury and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroudin with Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to balance the team and give rest to those who need it," Wenger mentioned.
Although Arsenal is a clear favorite to continue the F Group, Maximir Zagreb has one of Europe's most frightening stadiums.
Dinamo has also been invincible to the 41-game-time team.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night as the ground trembled at 3.2 on the Richter scale.
The quake was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned his lesson from last season after having to submit to Monaco. He is still motivated by the distant hope of piloting the team towards European championship.
"We have a huge energy charge," Wenger said.
"This title has not yet been hit by the Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006. On the other hand, I am also a realist with experience.
We are ambitious but not dreamers."
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us the truths about man-to-man friendship
A similar description shines by its absence in other series, which is noteworthy, especially in view of the fact that the need to open up is greater than ever and that the suicide statistics for young men are at their highest in 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the most significant cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain. Suicide is three times more common among men than among women.
Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) tackles the problem by declaring 2015 male year. The campaign aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking the help they need.
Friendship is the ultimate idea of the challenge.
A recent study interviewed 2 000 high school students, and the study showed that patients with depression symptoms are better off if they are surrounded by enough healthy people.
The probability of disease among non-symptomatic persons was also halved if there were persons close to them who did not have mental health problems.
Everything, however, is based on friendships.
Modern communication is dominated by social media, and communication style is often more important than content. Fast response is often considered more important than meaningful contact.
With the digitalisation of life, the need to appear strong, fun and successful doubled, although isolation is a reality.
External values, money, image and social status associated with superficial success are all distracted by internal values and our natural desire for personal growth and friendship. Internal values have a deeper impact on our mental health.
A millionaire in the video game industry recently stated that money cannot really buy happiness.
The greatness of the Friends was that the show turned the focus on its head.
None of the characters in the series were defined, not by profession, but by personality, which was reflected in friendships.
Joey and Chandler hugged or watched football with their TV chairs. We also saw Ross often miss Rachel. It was clear that men were able to relate to this even though they didn't hold back fully.
One volunteer explained this to me: "When I listen to depressed and suicidal people, it has become clear to me how much even the smallest reactions of friends can mean.
Men who contact us often cannot talk to their friends.
The traditional idea that men should be able to cope is strong. A man is easily regarded as weak if he talks about his problems."
"Frendit is one of the series of long-term survival mechanisms.
In the series, the small moments of man-to-man friendship were highlighted.
Through the phone I can offer help from outside at a time of despair, but long-term support comes from friends and family close friends."
In honor of Comedy Central's FriendsFest, the set has been resurrected, so if you're taking part in the event this weekend, you should take your friends for coffee at Central Perk.
Or do something even better. Smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks.
You never know how important it can be to a friendship.
Comedy Central broadcasts the whole Friends series - all 236 episodes - in honor of #FriendsFest
Di Maria's hit helped PSG defeat Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan after scored against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored in his Champions League debut and helped the PSG beat the Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Read the game report and rating.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were under attack when Paris Saint-Germain started working in the Champions League by hitting Malmö Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored after less than four minutes of debuting. She strengthened the position of the French champions at the moment. However, the PSG screwed up several goals before they could finally increase their lead: Cavani painted after 60 minutes of playing the game.
The A block also includes Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so the PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish champion. The PSG not only aims for a follow-up position in the playoffs but also wants to improve its positions for the quarter-finals in three remaining matches.
Even though the SPG caught the score, the match was not the perfect show for the team piloted by Laurent Blanc. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the goal stand and the man had to change when he was faced with his former home club, where the man began his spectacular career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win in the Champions League at home or in guests, so 2-0 wins and good gripes give us a good foundation, even though we still have something to do for the season," Blanc said.
"This is good.
We were thirsty for victory and we were able to do it, but I'm sorry we couldn't do one or two more goals."
Ibrahimovic returned to the team after the injury. The team had to settle for a 2-game league against Bordeaux in the league 1 series. However, Di Maria left Ibrahimovic in the shadows of four minutes.
Last month, an Argentine quay transferred from Manchester United to the PSG ranks was named the PSG's solver, who will raise the team to a new level in Europe. He proved himself worthy of the nomination when he rushed the ball from Marco Verratt past Malmö's defense and then fired an exact shot at the back corner of the goal Johan Wiland.
However, those who waited for the PSG to be crushed were disappointed.
Malmö defeated Celtic in the playoffs, marched nine international players from the start. The team playing with five men's defense and two attackers' tactics was difficult to win.
Nikola Djurdjic's shot passed the back pole of Kevin Trapp's goal at the 34th minute of the game. The team did not attack very actively.
Instead, the PSG succumbed to unnecessary feeding and weak finishing, not least Ibrahimovic, who lost five goals in the first half alone. At the beginning of the second half, Ibrahimovic's kick pitched the goal to the backs of Cavani.
But Ibrahimovic showed his fingernails in the pitching game. Di Maria shot a round kick past Wiland in 52 minutes.
The second goal was created at the time of the Count Cavan. The sixth Uruguay player playing the game shot a full shot when Ibrahimovic fed him a left winger from Maxwell's kick.
Malmö's kiri ended in another goal, and only Wiland's top-of-the-line defense against David Luiz's gunfire kept his readings in check, and Ezequiel Lavezz's paint was rejected at the end of the day.
Malmö's pilot Åge Hareide later admitted that the PSG was in its own category. "We played the game of the previous Champions League in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, where the level is not the same.
There's not enough qualifying.
A hat lift for the Parisians.
This was a top game for them."
Glencore raises $2.5 billion with a share issue.
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, tested by the price of raw materials, raised USD 2.5 billion in Wednesday's share issue as part of his debt reduction strategy.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, stated in his statement that he had sold new shares worth some GBP 1.6 billion in order to reduce debts.
The company's market value fell by 57% this year, wrestling with a drop in raw material prices, as the Chinese economic downturn hampers demand and burdens the market.
As a result of the issue, Glencore's share price hit the top of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday for the start of the morning.
The stock rose by 2.77% to 131.60% in the FTSE 100 index, which opened up to 0.69%.
Last week, Glencore announced its intention to raise $2.5 billion by share issue as part of a strategy to reduce its $30 billion debt by a third.
The company sold new shareholders at a price of 125 pence, which is 2.4 per cent down on Tuesday's closing price.
The company issued 1.3 billion shares with a total value of up to 9.99 per cent of the whole Group.
The concern about the continued economic downturn in China has caused the price of iron ore to collapse by half, while the fall in coal, copper and other commodities has been between 20% and 40%.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington.
The White House's communication of Tuesday confirms that China's President Xi Jinping will travel to the United States for a state visit at the end of the month.
Xi Jinping arrives for his first official visit to Washington on 25 September, a counter visit from President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November.
Following bilateral discussions between the Heads of State and Government, the President of the United States and the President's wife, Michelle Obama, will arrange dinners for Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liyuan, in honor of the state visit.
"The visit by President Xi Jinping will enable us to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a wide range of global, regional and bilateral issues of mutual interest, while President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping will have the opportunity to engage in constructive discussions on issues on which there is disagreement," states the White House communication.
Xi Jinping's visit was announced for the first time in February and is expected to visit Seattle to meet several US technical leaders. From Seattle, the President's trip would continue first to Washington and then to New York at the UN General Assembly on 28 September.
Obama and Xin are expected to raise a number of controversial issues, such as Washington's concern about alleged cyber espionage in China and the increased efforts of the country in controversial waters in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon Underplays Diversity in Filmmaking
Matt Damon had a heated conversation with Effie Brown, an African-American, and found that diversity was not needed behind the camera.
On Sunday night, an experienced actor in the HBO Project Greenlight series interrupted Brown, explaining how important it is to take different views into account in the selected script for the dark-skinned main character.
"The diversity is taken into account in the role of film, not in the role of the program," Damon claimed.
Brown was shocked and offended by the claim. "Wow, that's it," she said after Damon's comment that starring Mars alone.
Damon and Brown were gathered with the other producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the finalists of the contest.
"Whoever is the director, I would like to encourage you to consider how Harmony's character is presented," Brown said at first.
"The only black character is a prostitute who has sex with her white pimp."
The producer of the Dear White People film supported Leo Angelo and Kristen Brancaccio as film directors. Damon harshly replied that the choice of the two could lead to an undesirable outcome.
When the conversation was broadcast on television, social media exploded from Damon's disapproving comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the scene in direct words: "The fact that Matt Damon speaks to the only black person to explain what diversity is is so white that it hurts."
The tweet was distributed over 5,000 times and liked 4,000 times.
Damon's comments coincide with the time when equal representation of human races in the media is the number one topic.
Following the death of a teenage Michael Brown from a white police bullet in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement was supported across the country. The movement seeks to end the discriminatory treatment of lawmakers and authorities against black people.
In February, the singer Prince referred to the movement when he presented the year's album candidates at the Grammy gala.
"Albums still matter," he said.
"Just like books and the lives of black people, albums still matter."
Recently, the Black Lives Matter company published an opinion in response to the question from Elisabeth Hasselbeck of Fowl News as to whether this group should be described as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a group based on love," said the management.
Damon is one of the entertainment artists, producers and media moguls invited to the pope to discuss the Catholic Church's image in the West.
It is not known whether Damon has responded positively.
American Ninja Warrior series first winner
The professional climber and vessel collector Isaac Caldiero took the first American Ninja Warrior title on Monday and signed for a million dollars.
During the seventh period that has just ended the TV series, all the tasks assigned were cleared for the first time.
In the last episode of the season, Caldiero and photographer Geoff Britten made it to the final round.

The responsible producer, Kent Weed, talked to The Hollywood Reporter about the finals and why Britten is not rewarded even though he was the first competitor to clear up all the tasks.
"According to the rules, the fastest wins the prize money.
If more competitors find out all the tasks, the fastest win," Weed explained.
"Of course, the money prize is great and revolutionizes life, but Britten also gets satisfaction from her performance.
I don't think he's gonna stay here and think about it anymore.
He's just happy with his performance.
He has received much praise from the fans.
Britten's a great guy with a big family.
His kids and his wife think he's a hero.
Geoff told me that because he didn't win himself, he preferred Isaac to win.
He also believes that Isaac would have thought the same about him if the situation had been different."
America Ninja Warrior returned to the eighth season, which will begin in spring 2016.

But the team was successful on Tuesday by hitting Minnesota Twins at Target Field.
Twins lost his chance to get up to Houston Astros and fight for the second wild card spot in the playoffs.
Detroit returned, though only for one night, to the taste of victory, which has been behind the stone in the second half of the season.
"Every victory is nice, no matter how it is achieved," said Tiger pilot Brad Austus.
Alfredo Simon, the pitcher of the Tigers, stood his ground when Detroit succeeded three times in the first two innings, once in the sixth and once again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 turns of a good game and let three runs go.
He's only got three good startes in nine shifts.
"I just want to end the season strongly this year," said Simon.
"It's hard for a change player to throw every game, and that's why I want to pitch until the sixth shift."
Victor Martinez, the replacement pitcher of the Tigers, got three hits and hit two runs, which were his first hits since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first night of three hits after four hits against Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He hit well," said Ausmus.
"He looks good at batting practice and kept the tune in the game."
The second inning of the seventh inning, Twins had the best chance of getting back into the game.
Midwayer Byron Buxton started the shift by hitting two nests close to the left side line.
The real cockpit Aaron Hicks beat the sacrifice punch, and Simon took the second Brian Dozier, who took three straight assists before he was replaced by the left-handed Blaine Hardy.

However, the right - handed pitcher threw three straight pitches and was able to keep his team in position.
Detroit took advantage of the fact that Phil Hughes was a little rusty.
Tigers got three runs in the first two innings against a right-handed conk who had just gotten off the injured list back into the fields, and he was on the sidelines for a month because of the back infection.
"Of course, the start wasn't what I would have hoped for. However, as the game progressed, I felt more comfortable, and I was able to perform well and a few good pitches in the third inning," Hughes said.
After he got in charge, Hughes gave one nest hit to Ian Kinsler, number two, in the first inning.
The real J.D. Martinez Free bale brought Victor Martinez the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez's 0/21 streak broke when the team had players in their nests.
Nick Castellanos of the three was next hit by one nest, one run, but Victor Martinez was burned trying to get to three.
Tigers added his lead in the second inning, and the kidnapper James McCann survived a hit on second base and Anthony Gose on first base, where the score was 3-0.
"A hell of a hit," commented Twins Coach Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit very well, but he hit the right spot."
The pitch was for Hughes, who fed the scoreless third inning, after which he was replaced by his right-handed surrogate A.J. Achter.
Hughes's balance was three runs, six hits, a bale and four straight passes.
Remarkable: Tiger's right-handed hitter Anibal Sanchez wasn't part of the lineup due to a slump.
Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007, is investigating his shoulder.
Sanchez has been on the list of injured persons due to a shoulder rupture since mid-August and was scheduled to join him on Wednesday.
When Sanchez doesn't play, the left-handed hitter Daniel Norris leaves the list of injured and joins the starting lineup against Twins.
Norris has been awarded 1-1 in four games since he was replaced with his left-handed batter David Price on July 30.
He's been out of the lineup since August 20th because of a slanted abs rupture.
Tigers and Twins finish their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, running average: 4.43) is met by Ervin Santana (5-4, running average: 4.73).
