Camille Auer wanted to fix her sex, diagnosed as mentally ill, and now she's making art on the subject - "Man should have the right to his own body"
There are dozens of patient reports hanging from the roof of the Project Room gallery at the Academy of Fine Arts.
Every one of them says Camille Auer's name.
Papers tell a long story about how outsiders have written down their interpretation of Auer and his identity.
Decides for him who he is.
"I wanted to tell you my personal treatment history to make the process more violent," says Auer.
Through the process, he refers to the sex correction process.
It is often a period of years of research involving meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process starts with a referral to the diagnosis studies on "gender identity disorder" carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
As far as Auer is concerned, the process started four years ago.
Even before this, he had used the estrogen he had ordered via the Internet and was already very advanced in his own repair process.
He felt that he was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person has to go through the correction process so that sex can also be legally corrected.
The Translaki, i.e. the law on strengthening the transsecual sex (563/2002), obliges transgender people to be forced to sterilise so that the right sex can be brought into, for example, a population register centre and a passport.
At present, psychiatric diagnosis and evidence of reproductive failure are required for all persons who correct their genders.
A person has the right to decide his own body.
"This situation is intolerable and violates human rights," says Auer.
The reform of the Translator Act has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has made eight observations on the law and the European Court of Human Rights is a preliminary ruling which obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to exercise their sovereignty.
The previous Finnish government prepared a law amendment under the direction of then Minister of Social Affairs and Health Susanne Huovinen.
There was an election, and the Finns of Peru joined the government.
Now the legal amendment is stuck again.
It is a matter of internal political disputes which do not even have anything to do with this law.
"The government doesn't want to put it on the table because there are differences within the government about amending the law," says Frank Johansson, Executive Director of Amnesty's Finnish Department.
The front of the exhibition area is dominated by two large installations.
One of them consists of the packaging and instructions for use of the medicines used by Auer.
In the Patient Report installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of Auer by a psychologist at Tampere University Hospital.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and then wrote a report that would determine the right of Auer to care and receive help.
The sense of the reality of the study is exposed to wavering.
The researcher's perception of self appears in a fragmented way at the border level and the unstable personality features are highlighted.
Auer didn't recognize himself from these photo shoots.
"It was shocking to hear that I was diagnosed as mentally ill," says Auer.
An even greater shock was when Auer was not given sex correction treatment.
According to the medical staff, his resources were not sufficient to initiate the process.
He was denied his own identity.
On February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the television out of the waiting lobby.
Later, a work of art called Monument for the Exclusive was created on that television, where Auer reflected his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that anyone named at birth as a woman can magnify their breasts, but you need a diagnosis to remove your breasts," says Auer.
Your body is not yours if you feel that you are anything other than the number of your gender defined at birth.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not unique.
The gender correction process is harder for many for mental reasons than it is for purely medical operations.
Those who go through it meet dozens of people who need to be justified in their own existence and in their own sexual experience.
"It's crazy that people who are in need of support and help are denied treatment on the grounds that their resources aren't enough," says Auer.
Many people who have applied to the process have psychiatric symptoms: depression, anxiety, possible bullying experiences.
Based on these considerations, care professionals may prescribe that treatment cannot be initiated.
"Prohibiting treatment and help can put a person in an even worse situation than it was before the process began," says Auer.
Auer's personal exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition publication, Auer writes: "I have had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life and that is what people usually find difficult to digest."
Depression has been treated with drugs and when Auer started using hormones, it made me feel better.
He had finally been able to spell out feelings that had existed in childhood and in teenagers.
Why the wide jaw did not seem suitable for your body and why the breast muscles were to be round instead of a flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer has been that there are people around him who can see him.
To be seen is a basic need.
"You have to justify yourself so much by speaking, dressing, using sound and moving," he says.
Today, Auer already feels he's being seen. He exists as a woman.
In the early stages of the process, however, the random comments of loved ones could hurt a lot.
It hurts the most when loved ones are wronged.
"They should know and they know who I am, but they won't agree or be able to internalize it," he continues.
However, not all transhumans need physical changes.
They do not suffer from bodily dysphoria, or body conflict, in which the body or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and a long research process, there can be no formal confirmation of one's own gender.
"There is no medical basis for these studies," says Auer.
And it's true.
In Denmark, for example, Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of legal sex in June 2014.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination in relation to the legal sex.
The full-age applicant lodges a written application for a new identity number stating that he or she feels that he or she is of the other sex.
After a six-month period of reflection, the applicant shall confirm its application in writing and the Ministry shall assign the applicant a new personal identity code.
This right of self-determination is also required in Finland, and Auer's exhibition is also crystallised in this requirement.
It has not been an artist's therapeutic experience, but an exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.
I want to believe that art still has weight and that it can bring about political change at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.

The Civil Rights Organisation issued a travel warning to Missouri
The national NAACP, which promotes African-American civil rights, has issued a travel warning for Missouri, due to discriminatory practices in the state and racist attacks there.
"The NAACP travel notice for Missouri will enter into force on 28 August 2017 and will call on African-American tourists, visitors and locals to pay particular attention and to exercise extreme caution when travelling in a state where there have recently been a number of questionable racial events," notes the information report.
The law recently introduced in Missouri makes it difficult to export cases of discrimination to justice, and the implementation of state laws is disproportionate to minorities, according to the NAACP, which led to the issuing of a travel warning.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They are stopped by skin color and beaten or killed," Rod Chapel, Chairman of NAACP Missouri, said to Kansas City Star.
"We've never heard of so many cases in such a short time before."
The travel notice for Missouri is the first warning for the United States State.
For example, the organisation mentioned racist comments against African-American students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year, and he was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel, and he was arrested by the Missouri police, even though he was not charged with a crime.
The travel note also referred to the Missouri Minister of Justice's report that the police are 75% more likely to stop a black driver than a white driver.
"The purpose of the travel bulletin is to encourage people to be on guard and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri," says Chapel.
"People must prepare themselves, for example, by including money to pay bail or by telling relatives that they are going to travel through the state."
According to the FBI, one hundred hate crimes were recorded in Missouri in 2015, which is the 16th highest number of U.S. states.
The travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult to challenge companies for discrimination in housing and employment relations.
The ACLU, which defends civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they had adopted immigration laws which oblige the police to arrest people for immigration offences, which, according to the organisation, increases racial profiling.
In general, travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and concern other countries, but recently they have been published by NGOs in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair for an account of the CEO's supplementary pension
Mika Lintilä, Minister of Economic Affairs responsible for State Ownership, has asked Finnair for a report on the supplementary pension payment received by the airline CEO Pekka Vauramo, Yle explains.
According to the Minister, this is contrary to the state's will.
The supplementary pension of EUR 130 000 was raised this week when Helsingin Sanomat reported on the remuneration development of directors of listed companies.
Suomen Kuvalehti reports on Vauramo's supplementary pension in February.
Finnair announced that he would give up supplementary pensions in 2013.
The government has pointed out that supplementary pensions are not used for remuneration.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year's policy decision on ownership management.
The sanctions immediately made the speeches louder
Not long ago, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia were on the way from cold to warm.
At the G20 meeting in Hamburg, US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin seemed to be getting along just fine.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
Russia reacted bitterly to the new economic sanctions adopted last week by the US Congress and signed by Trump on Wednesday.
The most stunning response has so far been heard from Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who says that the sanctions law signed by Trump means a 'full-scale trade war'.
Even if the Russian reactions were only offset by political rhetorical exaggerations and excesses, it is a fact that the relationship between the United States and Russia became tighter after the short honeymoon after Trump's election.
In the United States, the pass of the sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea was not simple.
Although the law was adopted by Congress with considerable unanimity, it was reported to the President that the adoption of the law was much more difficult.
In fact, Trump criticised the law he had recently signed as "significantly inadequate."
President Trump's grumpiness must have been caused in particular by Russia, although the adoption of the law restricting his own prerogatives must also have been repugnant.
As is well known, there is an investigation in the United States into the possible involvement of Russia in the presidential elections and the links between the Trump campaign and Russia.
The tightening of the relationship between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon.
When the staff of the White House has changed rapidly and the various scandals have almost been updated, it seems increasingly that foreign policy is not being conducted in the United States under the leadership of the President, but in spite of the President.
Such a situation is certainly not desirable.
If the relationship with Russia is chimurant in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the core region of the Union in the Baltic Sea is intensifying relations.
The EU has been prominent in its relations with Russia on the situation in Ukraine and has called for the implementation of the Minsk agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained united at least on the surface in its Russian policy, the interests of the Member States are very different.
For a Member State which trades much with Russia, such as Finland, economic sanctions have been a real nuisance.
The effects of the recent US sanctions are still unclear.
There is a fear in the EU that sanctions will make it difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, for example, the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly Fennovoima's nuclear power plant project may be affected.
Acidity in Europe has been caused by the exclusion from sanctions, for example, of liquid natural gas ing that is important to the US economy.
Trade sanctions are a means of world politics to show disapproval.
However, economic sanctions must be well thought out and precise.
Otherwise, they will easily be more harmful than beneficial.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trump's White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty.
To interfere with the statues is the surest sign of a change of power.
The Americans know this as well as anyone else: the Iraqis, together with American soldiers, poured Saddam Hussein's statue in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideologies of the Trump administration, knew well what he was doing in a heated debate with CNN channel Jim Acosta. The Statue of Liberty was attacked by Miller in a vocabulary about the President's proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller didn't really criticize the statue himself.
If he had done so, he would have been attacked by huge herds of cruise organizers and figures imitating the Statue of Liberty.
The object of his attack was the meaning of the statue, and especially the fact that in 1903 Emma Lazarus' poem was added to the statue's pedestal - 17 years after the statue was completed.
This is how Miller beat Acosta: "I don't want to go into its history now, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the whole world.
The poem was added later, and it is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller was not wrong in himself, but it is not just a question of history, as he himself said.
The key words of Lazarus are the touching words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the state not only invites immigrants but the "poorest poorest": "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to break free, / The wretchetd refuse of your teaming shore."
The poem is now more topical than ever.
Miller did not practice literary criticism; he made it clear that "the poorest of the poor" are not welcome in the Trump United States.
The dispute over the importance of the Statue of Liberty is part of a wider political and cultural dispute over the importance of the United States.
After Lazarus' death, his friends campaigned for the poetry to be attached to the statue's pedestal.
The purpose of the statue was to express the links between French and American republicanism by classical symbolism, the feminine incarnation of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem the female figure is no longer abstract but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the banished.
Connecting the poem to the image was a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American idea of nationality.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to turn it back into the original.
Rush Limbaugh - a kisser who can now be regarded as some kind of sign of Trump - claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not present an invitation to anyone, but is an early forerunner of neo-Conservatives who takes the U.S. torch to a world covered by darkness: "Lady Liberty comes forward.
He takes the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch does not lead the way to the United States."
Rarely, Limbaugh was partly right.
The meaning of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on the perspective.
Lazarus saw it like poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the ship's deck after a long and trying journey.
He saw it from the perspective of people looking for shelter and a better life.
His Statue of Liberty is comforted by giving hope and welcoming.
And that's what Miller and Trump absolutely don't want.
Their torch does not lead the way, but stirs up the flames of hatred, their only source of power.
Athletics World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the British national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots got on the British national team.
Neil Black, executive director of the British Athletics Association, says that the 16 Scottish members of the World Championship team are "significant confirmation."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Athletic Championships starting in London on Friday.
According to Black, in Scotland "something special is happening," which Britain's athletics must learn from.
"This is welcome and we will continue to study it so long that we understand what is at stake," Black says.
"I was talking to representatives of the Scottish Institute for Sports and they thought it had something to do with the work of the Institute.
The Scottish Athletics Association believes that it is related to the activities of the Union,
and the British Athletics Association believes that it is based on their activities.
And a regular street thug thinks he must have something to do with it.
However, it is something quite awesome, whatever it is."
Many Scottish athletes compete in London for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in a 5,000-metre race. Eilidh Doyle was chosen as the captain of the national team.
"Eilidh is too modest.
His captain's speech was incredibly gorgeous," Black says.
"The athletes left the event proudly and strongly motivated by their achievements, regardless of where they happen to live and practice.
Eilidh's words had genuine feelings and passion for sports."
Eilidh Doyle is a silver medalist for the Commonwealth Championship in a 400-metre fence race, and these are his fifth world championships. He thinks it's "unbelievable" that there are 16 Scots on the national team.
The previous record was seven for 1983 and 2015.
Laura Muir, a middle traveler, has run five British and two European records in the course of the year.
He competes in London at 1,500 meters and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare runs 1,500 metres in London. Also worth keeping an eye on him: the man has an excellent season behind him, including winnings at British World Championships and Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup, when the only Scot on the national team besides him was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he's "hugely proud" that there are so many Scots, some of whom are seriously competing for finals and medals.
"It is an honor to be a captain anyway, but it is even more special because the members of the national team voted for the captain," Doyle says.
"I am, of course, very proud of all the Scots who made it to the national team.
It shows how far we've come.
They are involved as distinguished athletes competing for prize winners.
My captain's speech?
I think it went okay.
I was focused on how lucky we are to have a home race.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home public and the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to compete there and I know that the atmosphere will be amazing."
Prevention of critics on Facebook: Do not run for public office if you cannot handle criticism
Our country's father knew what bad publicity was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began criticizing him for all possible domestic politics, always on his political principles.
I'm sure the criticism was annoying.
But he didn't shut up his critics.
"If the freedom of speech is removed, we may be led as foolish and quiet as sheep to be slaughtered," Washington said in 1783.
Which brings us to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff has removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked their authors.
Hogan was sued earlier this week by the United States League of Civil Rights.
His staff considered the challenge to be unfounded, and this was an understatement also online.
"What difference does it make? This is just Facebook," many commentators.
But it matters.
Especially in Hogan's case.
Hogan is an amazingly popular Republican governor of the Democratic state.
He's got the second-best estimate of his operations among the 50 governors.
Hogan is not a sensitive hothead.
He has been a firm leader in the state and he has insisted on principles.
He has also used Facebook as the main channel of communication with his voters and published a picture of a bald head in chemotherapy.
Therefore, it is unnecessary and even dangerous to block users coming to the Governor's Facebook page. The Governor's page is a public and official forum maintained by his staff with tax revenue.
Hogan's spokesman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions in an interview with Washington Post, who said it was only a matter of moderation of comments.
However, labeling commentators as trolls, spams or haters is too easy.
Washington Post interviewed users who were blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They proved to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to their chosen leaders, not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors, for example.
They reported that their comments were respectful, considerate, and relevant.
In his comment, the pastor quoted the Bible; he wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Maryland Bowie was not hostile but asked a question about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate crimes and other recent news," he wrote in comments from Washington Post.
"I also find it unacceptable that, when more people comment on the same issue, they are immediately regarded as an organised group and ignored as a large group of concerned citizens."
The governor's staff called the comments a "focused attack," and someone else might call them to advance what was considered important.
In the Facebook era, communication is easy to manage by blocking the critic or removing a critical comment.
In the old days, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or to arrest and silence protestors.
But really, it's the same thing, now it's just digital.
Hogan is not the first public official accused of chaining Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users prevented by President Trump have sued him.
The first major decision was taken last week in Virginia.
According to James C. Cacheris, judge of the District Court of Alexandria, the Loudoun County Government violated the first amendment to the United States Constitution by blocking the electorate on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Rights Association was discussing the use of Twitter and Facebook with the Republican governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin.
This shouldn't be difficult.
In Washington's day, cheaper postage charges had a similar effect to those of the Internet today.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers battered Washington.
Even then there were trolls.
The nicknames Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius wrote letters to the newspapers calling out Washington's decisions.
The President's office was flooded with petitions to criticise Jay's agreement on cooperation, trade and shipping between the United States and Britain, which is reflected in the documents collected by the Papers of George Washington online project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and debate are the cornerstones of our nation.
Real leadership means accepting this fact.
It is appropriate to stop the summer feeding of birds immediately
There have been samples from about half a dozen places, and also online notifications from a couple of, three.
Most of them have come from Southern and Varsinais-Suomi, but then also from the individual Haapavesi and Seinäjoki," says Specialist Marja Isomursu from Evira.
Green finches have died of a parasite called tricomonosis.
It is caused by a scientific protozoa called Trichomonas gallinae.
It's been known to hit pigeons in the past, especially the pigeon.
However, in the 21st century, the disease also began to be detected in finches.
In 2009, he threw a real bang.
At that time, tricomonosis caused a major collapse in Finland's green finch strain, and since then the species's strains have been recovering.
There have now been sick green finches, but at least not yet on a large scale," says Juha Honkala, Museum Master of Science at the University of Helsinki.
The fear is that the previous epidemic of greenfingers will recur again if something is not done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that can be done by everyone: to stop the summer feeding of birds immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from a home-field advantage at the Renaissance Club
Former European number one player Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from the home field advantage for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in Eastern Lothian hosts the 25th Scots Senior Open tournament.
Last year Rafferty of Northern Ireland led a tournament in the next Archerfield Links field before the last round, but eventually lost to Paul Eles. Rafferty is fond of a new location and will act as ambassador for the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
"I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event it will be filled with glory," says Rafferty.
"Players see the field at its best. It's in great shape.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He's the zealous ambassador of the game, and he's proud of his accomplishments here.
The tournament is a great showcase for this field."
England's Eales defends the championship for the first time, although he has won both the European tour and the European challenger tour in his 32-year career.
"This feels like a really special occasion," says a player living in Southport.
"I didn't get to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because the tournament isn't part of the tournament this year.
It's great to be back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come to mind: winning the tournament was a great thing for me and my wife, Sharon.
It was a great time we'll always remember."
Gary Orr is back in action on his own soil, and he went on tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday.
This is his first performance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
"Playing at home is always more relevant than usual," says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
"You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again and I've played pretty hard.
I'm happy with my game so far."
The three will be joined by the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The tournament will be attended by six Scots: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
There is free access to the tournament. Parking a car costs five pounds if only the driver is in the car and ten pounds if there are at least two people in the car.
All proceeds are donated to the Prostate Cancer UK Cancer Organization.
Säkylä investigated possible indoor air problems in the barracks.
In Säkylä, no indoor air problems have been found at the Pori Brigade communications company's barracks, at least for the time being," the brigade was told on Thursday.
Indoor studies will continue.
The studies began when a man who interrupted his military service for health reasons thought his health was weakened by bad indoor air in the barracks.
According to Lieutenant Colonel Mika Holma, Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigade, no problems have been identified in the health situation of other armies.
It turned out that this was an isolated case and no health problems have been encountered by others serving in that unit.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to clarify this thoroughly.
At the moment it is not known that we have any indoor air problem," Holma says.
The letter from the Brigadier says that due to the arrival in July, supplies must have been moved into the barracks, which may have caused a temporary increase in dust.
As a result, the air may have seemed stuffy," says Holma.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Golden Land
Bardina Degei doesn't use a stove to cook.
He doesn't even use pot very often.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarothal, the capital of the Paniai region, located in the troubled province of Papua, Indonesia. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts a sweet potato - locally "witch" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the sweet potato burned on the cranberry will be eaten greedily with bare, unwashed hands.
Degei's home doesn't have furniture. He sits on a muddy floor where he usually does his daily chores, such as washing in the muddy water from a nearby swamp.
The toilet service is provided by a bucket in a penthouse.
Degei is the youngest of her husband's four wives, and she has not been assigned to care for the fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Late work can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed and many drink a lot, and soldiers must be taken into account.
"No one dares to walk into the village after 5:00 a.m.," says Degei.
This is a rare peek into everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969. The annexation was preceded by a controversial referendum in which 1,026 village elders were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed Dutch power, quickly turned its anger to the government of Jakarta, which controls the region strictly and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from accessing it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua. East of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is remote and dreary. The journey to Enarotali starts on a one-and-a-half-hour flight from the province capital to Nabire and continues on a five-hour drive to the belly-wringing car.
There's no public transport here.
A city of some 19,000 inhabitants has bamboo - surrounded wooden houses with rust stained with yellow browns.
Few Indonesians have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived in Papua, the Mee Pago tribes worshipped the Uga Tamee god.
There have been other changes.
"We didn't wear such clothes," says Degei. He means his colorful hand-woven wrapper, dark skirt and brightly colored blouse.
"Before we had only leaves covered in our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line, with child mortality and illiteracy among the highest in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's gold country.
Paniai is an upland area about the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants. Only about 100 kilometers from Pania is Grasberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine owned by Freeport McMoran, located in Phoenix, USA.
In 2015, the mine provided Freeport with $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion stock of wood.
However, for the Papuas, these riches bring misery, for they mean the repressive presence of a strong Indonesian army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and military local units between 1998 and 2004, with individual officers being paid up to $150,000.
Papua's demands for greater self-determination threaten this source of income and are silenced mercilessly.
According to human rights activists, since 1969 the Indonesian army has killed more than 500,000 people and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, massacres in the highlands of the Papua tribes in the 1970s took place in terms of genocide.
Last year, more than 3 900 people were arrested in the region by the Indonesian police in peaceful demonstrations.
The 2016 We Will Lose Everything report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane contains reports of the atrocities of the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture - rape and electrocution are particularly popular means - and ruthless attacks on peaceful demonstrations.
"The number of victims is difficult to calculate because there are weekly cases," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher of Human Rights Watch.
Screws have been tightened when Papua's natural resources attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83 percent are Christians, but the population structure is changing as the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawes move to the region for a better livelihood than Muslims.
Jaava's warung food stalls sell fried chicken and gado-gado vegetable blend in peanut sauce.
It's hard for locals to compete.
"Moderns have started selling chicken and vegetables in the market at a cheaper price than locals," says 24-year-old Abeth You, from Paniai and moved to the province capital after work.
"Local women lost their clients."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo - nicknamed Jokowi - promised in his 2014 election campaign to address Papua injustices and human rights violations.
Papua consists of 29 regions, and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 regions, including Pania, on his way to the presidential castle in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 and we waited for him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice," You says.
Only two months after the inauguration of Jokow in October, the Panai were experiencing some kind of wavebed.
Eleven children were singing Christmas carols by the fire at Enarotal on December 7, 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared from the dark on motorcycles.
The frightened children told the soldiers that they should wear headlights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to reports of victims and Witnesses, drunken soldiers apprehended children and beat them with rifles.
That's how one of the soldiers shot at the kids.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of assault.
A few hours later, the building of the State Election Commission near the scene was set on fire, and the next day began to happen.
About a thousand papians - young men and women and children - gathered in the football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They had hunting springs for ceremonial ceremonies, and they began to play the traditional Waita dance of the Papuaan Mee Pago tribe, dancing in the ring and imitating the bird's song.
Some of the protesters began to stone police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere got hotter, the soldiers received an order on the internal radio system: "If the crowds resist more than three times, shoot them to death." The information is based on an official document seen by Time magazine which has not been published to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, President of the Kego Koto area, anticipated that the situation would get out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
Nobody wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot in the left wrist," he told Time magazine on the porch of his painted wooden house in bright color.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the soldiers' ranks.
"Several shots were fired in the crowd."
Alfius Youwi was shot three times, and his cousin saw the shootings.
"I ran to him and made sure it was really him," told Yohanes Time magazine sadly. Like many Indonesians, he only uses one name.
"I saw that he was dead... and I kissed him."
Papua Police Superintendent Yotje Mende told the reporters that the police only "protected" the police station because it was under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Papua police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo in 2015.
"Then it's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many were injured.
The information about the killings came to Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, in Jayapura, Jokowi gave an emotional speech expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promising to address the violence in Papua.
"I want this case to be investigated immediately so that it never happens again."
In October 2016, Mr Wiranto, Minister for Security, said that he would launch investigations into human rights violations outside the legal system.
However, he immediately began to cancel his speech.
"Most of the violations took place a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate the violations, but that requires certain processes," he said.
In an interview with Time magazine in Jakarta on June 5, 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said that he was not going to start studies in Papua.
"Everything will be settled in court," he told me.
The UN blames Mr Wiranto for 'crimes against humanity', involving the death of more than a thousand people in the bloody vote on independence in East Timor in 1999. Wiranto told Time magazine that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, including the events in Pania, have already been investigated.
The families of the victims of Paniai have a gloomy disbelief about these claims.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things haven't progressed in any way," Yohanes says.
"I'm already tired of this."
He says he's still living in fear, even though it's been years.
"Yes, I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, and I'm afraid I'm going to get shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panians are afraid to discuss the event.
He tells us that the soldiers had abused him after he helped bury four of the victims.
"The soldiers will hunt me down after the victims are buried," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighboring area of Paniai, Deiya.
One died and 17 were injured in the conflict between the villagers and the head of the construction company, which began when the manager refused to take the unconscious man to the hospital. Among the injured were children.
The man in need of hospital care was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been laid on water while fishing in a nearby river, who died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers showed their minds at the construction site in front of the company's office.
According to the police, the villagers stoned policemen who responded with warning shots.
According to locals, however, the mobile police unit of the Indonesian paramilitary police opened fire on the mob when one villager was killed.
"We're terrified, we're afraid of revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw wounded being brought into treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for shots fired at police officers to be held accountable and for a mobile police unit to be pulled out of the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of real development feeds dissatisfaction in the Mee, Mony, Dani and Damal tribes, which live in Papua's lush central highlands.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), an army of rebels who claim to defend the rights of the Palestinian people through random attacks and kidnapping of Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of the heads of OPM are from Paniai, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by arresting and arbitrary detention of thousands of people in Pania in the name of 'protection of national sovereignty'.
Some of them will never come back.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "the sad, forgotten place."
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
There is only a small quantity of rice for sale in Enarotal, and that too is too expensive for locals,
Just like the bread.
People grow their own food: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruit and leaf vegetables.
Farming is women's work, and one woman may be responsible for four or five potato fields.
Most of the crop is for the family, and the rest is sold in the market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, differences in the income of locals and migrants have increased and the number of migrants has increased since new routes were opened to Nabire Airport.
There are few jobs and they usually go to better educated and wealthier migrants in the local community.
Few people in the country have sufficient capital and know-how to run their own business competitively.
"Young people do not want to stay in the village because there is no work or money," says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Outlying Papua in the world will be a little distracted.
In addition, restrictions on international reporting remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua even though they had been granted a rare licence for filming, and the official reason was the inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kinen, Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Asia, Jokowi has not kept his electoral promises; he has not increased transparency and has not promoted development by removing restrictions on news coverage.
"The journalists from the troubled eastern provinces of Indonesia, Papua and Western Papua New Risks: refusal of a visa and blacklisting," said Kine in his statement.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian Government is only under pressure from its immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "a number of widespread violations" in Papua, including the shooting of Paniai.
These countries have also traditionally supported the Papua Liberation Movement.
The Indonesian Foreign Minister, Armanatha Nasir, denied the accusations and told journalists in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so covering up the evidence of human rights violations would be difficult'.
The locals want foreign governments to intervene.
On 4 May 2017, when the Dutch delegation, led by Ambassador Kees Van Bar, visited Jayapura, the locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, says the anonymous source who attended the meeting.
There are presidential elections in Indonesia in 2019, but the papians tell us that they are no longer likely to vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi means well, but there are people around him who are involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, President of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokow to know the situation of the Panics: they live under the power of a greedy and unpredictable army in need and poverty, practically without health care and training facilities.
According to Gobai, the Panai, like the other parrots, regard their votes to Jokowi as a "debt" that must be repaid.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting once again metaphorically protested: they buried one of the victims in the country opposite the police station and the military headquarters.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed," Yacobus says head down.
"What else can we do?"
Dereck Chisora barks at the cancellation of Robert Helenius' rematch: "Even his own fans don't want to see"
Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora of the heavyweight boxers were supposed to fight at the Hartwall arena on May 27th.
However, the match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, Chisora flops the reason for flipping the rematch to Helenius' shoulders.
My fight in Finland flopped, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland. I don't want to sell tickets there.
It was my Finnish opponent's fault.
Even his fans don't want to see him fight because he sucks, Chisora bores.
Helenius and Chisora met for the first time in a full Hartwall arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial score.
The ticket sales of the rematch were slow, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Evening Words in May that the match had been postponed until autumn.
There's been nothing new about the fight since.
However, Chisora is no longer uncomfortable with his cancellation.
After all, the fight would probably have had to be cancelled after Chisora's illness.
Thursday, three days before the time of the fight, I woke up in a lot of pain.
My daughter was about to explode.
The hospital said I had to have surgery," Chisora says.
The British say they're in about 45% condition at the moment.
He doesn't seem to be interested in a rematch with Helenius, but he's targeting Dillian Whyte.
Chisora was defeated by Whyte in December.
The fire took over the Torch skyscraper in Dubai for the second time.
The flames took over one of the world's tallest residential buildings in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of residents had to flee from a 79-story building 337 meters high.
This was the second fire in two years' time in a building called Torch, a torch.
The building was emptied and no one is known to have been injured.
"We were asleep and woke up with a fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took about ten minutes," a resident named George told Reuters.
According to Dubai's rescue services, the fire brigade was able to shut down the fire at 4:00 a.m. local time and stayed to cool down the building.
The government announced that they would arrange accommodation for those who left their home.
The case may raise questions about the safety of materials used on the exterior surfaces of high buildings around the world.
After the 2015 fire, the Torch building board commissioned a study that found that the most damaged were sheets used for facade cloaking and insulation.
In Great Britain, the police believe that the isolation and cloaking boards of the London Grenfell Tower could contribute to the rapid progress of the flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.
A moped was stolen from a parking lot in Joensuu during the night.
A moped was stolen from the Joensuu parking lot between 9:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. on Tuesday.
The moped disappeared from Niinvaara at Tikkamäentie 2.
The moped was marked Sky Team Monkey.
It's red in color, and the registration number is 27-REV.
They found the moped later on Thursday.
Police are requesting observations about the moped or its abduction by e-mail to address This email address is being protected from spambots.

In the United States, more than 20% of air passengers take prohibited items on board, reveals a survey
A survey of air passengers reveals that more than 20 percent of passengers in the United States had taken prohibited items consciously or unknowingly to airplanes by the U.S. Department of Traffic Safety (TSA) checkpoints. At least six percent of passengers had knives or other bladed objects that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than one percent said that they did not know until afterward that they had mistakenly transported weapons, ammunition, or explosives.
More than a thousand passengers responded to the questionnaire and were carried out by Stratos Jet Charters. The results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to defy the rules than others.
19.7% of passengers knowingly breaking TSA rules were members of the Y generation and less than 15% were members of the X generation.
The most common violation of the rules was the introduction of food and fluids into the aircraft.
More than three percent admitted to knowingly taking bladed objects to the aircraft, and 2.2 percent of women and 3.7 percent of men reported knowingly taking banned drugs to the aircraft.
Passengers from all over the United States participated in the survey. The company that carried out the survey wanted to find out how many had accidentally taken contraband goods past the security check and how many had done so knowingly.
It is not surprising that the most frequent travellers are also most likely to take smuggling goods past security - knowingly or unknowingly.
But as the company that did the survey notes, TSA's instructions are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know which liquids to take on board and how much.
So it is no surprise that most of TSA's seizures are liquid.
For some time there was also the belief that books should not be taken into the aircraft.
Liquids may be exported to domestic flights but not to international flights.
Mr Scott Pruitt, Director of the US Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his decision to delay decisions taken during the Obama period to reduce emissions
A day after the 15 states had sued Scott Pruitt, director of the EPA, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, he withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of the decisions taken under the Obama regime to reduce smog emissions.
According to Pruitt, the change shows that the agency he has led takes greater account of the needs of the environmental decision-makers in the Länder.
Pruitt did not mention a single word about an action brought against his previous decision before the Federal Appeal Court.
The Länder should start complying with the 2015 level of ground ozone as from 1.10.
In June, Mr Pruitt announced that he would postpone the implementation of the decisions for one year so that his office would have more time to familiarise itself with the plan because the Agency "does not want to interfere with local decision-making or hamper economic growth."
Pruitt was the public prosecutor of the State of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him head of the EPA. Pruitt is known as an opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since coming to Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions taken by the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden change of mind is the latest setback for Pruitt's plan to relax regulations.
Last month, the Federal Appeal Court in Washington issued a ruling that the EPA leader exceeded his mandate to try to delay the implementation of the Obama decision on oil and gas companies, which obliged companies to monitor and reduce methane leakages.
In the opinion delivered on Wednesday evening, Pruitt argued that his full turn on ozone regulations merely strengthened the EPA cooperation with the Länder in a complex process aimed at meeting the new requirements in accordance with the timetable.
"In previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and then waited for activists' groups and others to sue it to reach an agreement on timetables," said Pruitt. In his previous action, he sued the Agency more than ten times.
"We do not believe in regulation through trials and take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and the powers it confers on us."
However, the EPA opinion concluded that Pruitt could continue to use its "power to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers" to ensure that the provisions "are justified and based on best available information."
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader change in the ozone regulations.
The aim of the legislative initiative adopted last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
Eric Schneiderman, Public Prosecutor of the State of New York, who has brought the EPA to trial this week, said that the group is going to continue to exert pressure.
"The change of mind of the EPA as a result of our actions is a significant victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans exposed to the direct effects of smog in their communities," said Schneiderman.
In addition to New York, the proceedings included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia.
Ground ozone occurs when emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants, for example, react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems for sensitized groups of people, and this is also part of the cause of thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists rejoiced at Pruitt's surprising change of direction.
"It is worrying how much pressure it took to make the guy in charge of our breathing air use common sense," says Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the Trump regime, as its ideological objective is to act on the terms of polluters and other groups of interests."
A SUV coming from the supercar manufacturer... "takes place in Ferrari style."
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars while at the same time trying to maintain its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will happen in Ferrari style," said Sergio Marchionne, President and CEO at the press conference on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when an Italian supercar manufacturer presents his new five-year plan, Automotive News reports.
All cases of eastern Savo measles of the same type of virus
Beach salmi measles infection is the same type of virus as the previous cases of East Savo, reported by the THL.
The Institute for Health and Welfare's Virology Laboratory has confirmed on Thursday that the fifth measles infection in Eastern Savo is the same strain of the virus as previous infections.
The THL has ensured that the measles infection confirmed on Friday 28 July by a beach salmi person has the same type of virus as the previous Eastern Savo cases.
Based on this information, all infections in Eastern Savo are related to the first measles in the region in June.
The news is good because it means that we have not come up with any other types of measles virus.
However, it is possible that after the fifth one, new infections can still appear until mid-August, and the epidemic is not yet over," says Mirkaleena Erkkilä, doctor responsible for primary health care in Soster.
No new measles infections or their suspicions have emerged since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important for everyone to ensure that their own vaccination protection is up-to-date," Erkkilä recalls.
More information: Three new measles infections were confirmed in Pirkanmaa - "More infections or epidemic very unlikely"
Finland is preparing to make a permitted scream
The moonshine soup wasn't even considered legal.
Background to the argument that the process produces methanol, which is toxic in addition to alcohol.
Making a scream at home is legal next year, but legalizing moonshine soup is not even considered.
The scream is made by fermentation, while the moonshine is distilled.
The basis behind the regulation of distillation is that the process produces methanol, which is toxic, along with alcohol.
There has been no political will to set up a moonshine soup for everyman's right," comment Ismo Tuominen from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the Ministry prepared the reform of the Alcohol Act, the distillation of moonshine was not considered lawful.
Nor was it brought to the political table.
There was no debate on the liberalisation of distillation," states Member of Parliament Outi Mäkelä.
He is in a negotiating group of parliamentary groups of government parties who took a position on the reform of the Alcohol Act.
The permission to distil moonshine at home cannot be granted even on application.
Commercial manufacturing is also subject to authorisation.
Importation tells us that there is a simple rule for making alcoholic beverages at home: alcohol can be produced at home by fermentation.
This means that, in addition to beer, cider and wine, there is a legal way to make a scream at home.
The government has wanted to simplify the regulations.
The new law removes requirements for flavours and flavouring substances and enables the production of screams," Mäkelä explains.
The preparation must still be made in such a way that the raw materials or flavouring substances resulting from their fermentation are clearly visible in the drink.
Under the new law, drinks can be prepared as much as they want, and self - made alcohol can be given as a gift.
You can't put it on the market anymore.
Making a scream is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominen believes.
A much larger change took place in 2004, when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of the alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The alcohol bill is now under review by the Ministry of Justice.
The Alcohol Act comes before the Parliament as soon as the autumn season begins.
The plenary session is held on 5 September.
The Act will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if Parliament has already taken a stand, Mäkelä rejoices.
Oscar Pistorius was rushed to the hospital with armed guards.
Oscar Pistorius, a victim of chest pain, was rushed to a South African hospital because of suspected heart attack.
Pistorius has already gotten out of the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving his prison sentence in Atteridgeville Prison.
According to the British newspaper Mirror, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning with armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest pain, but he got out of the hospital this afternoon.
The prison spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for an investigation.
The spokesman for the Pistorius family, on the other hand, told me that the former top athlete was fine.
Last summer the Supreme Court sentenced six times the Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Litter phone conversations reveal that Trump has been pushing Mexico to build a border wall.
Literating telephone conversations between U.S. president Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia have been leaked to Washington Post.
In a telephone conversation on 27 January 2017, Trump urged the President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, to stop his public talk that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
"You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also published a literation of Trump's first call to the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
Trump said to Turnbull that the agreement whereby the United States would take refugees on their way to Australia was to be "laughter', "dumb' and "stupid'. According to Trump, the agreement negotiated during the Obama period would make him look like an idiot because he had proposed a ban on the settlement of refugees in the United States.
Trump hung up by telling Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant call all day."
Georgia's Massacre: Activists again staged racist lynching in the hope of justice
The Ford Mercury car bypasses the crowd in the small town of Monroe in the Georgian countryside and continues its way towards the small bridge of Moore's Ford.
There are four black passengers in the car and a white driver, four armed men blocking the road before the car reaches the bridge.
The leader of the group, a middle-aged man dressed in a striped suit takes a deep breath from his cigar and peers through the windshield.
Passengers are scared.
"Roger, n--o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-
"Get out of the car!"
Screams break silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is only a redesign that was presented on 22 July 2017.
However, the sighs of shock are genuine when the noose is put around "Roger's" neck.
Since 2005, human rights organisations have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to re-enact the 1946 events. At that time, Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one's ever been charged with murder.
"It's confusing that no one has been arrested in these years - even though murderers live among us and many have to know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the remodeling.
"It's a disgrace of history, but above all, it's a burden that weighs on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and a former Georgian congressman.
To him, reenactment is a startling call to action, and it also reminds the people of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want those responsible to be brought to justice. We want things finally to be concluded, and we want to recover from the grief and make peace, but above all we want justice," says Brooks.
"We can't recover and make peace until we get justice."
The coroner covers the body of the victim who died in Georgia's massacre on July 27, 1946.
According to the NBC news reports, more than 50 men were suspected of lynching in Monroe and surrounding counties.
But no one was charged with murder.
Although the culprits have been free for decades, according to activists, the motives of lynching have always been known to locals: politics and sex.
In 1946, by decision of the Supreme Court, the blacks of the state of Georgia were allowed to vote for the first time in the presidential election, and the Supreme Court issued its decision in April, and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, there was an incident at the time of the election where a black tenant named Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, in a fight apparently involving Malcom's wife, Dorothy.
According to Brooks, the city was rumored that Hester had had an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was pregnant with her.
According to FBI information, a powerful white landowner, Loy Harrison, on July 25, 1946, paid Malcom's $600 bail against which he was released from prison.
On the way home, Malcom and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their car before Moore's Ford bridge.
"It turns out that Harrison ordered and organized the murders," says the FBI report.
"It is also evident that there was a conspiracy between the state and the local authorities, which involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks will put it more succinctly.
"It was a vote murder," he says.
"They were murdered because they wanted to tell black people that they would do the same if they were to vote."
Cassandra Greene has been directing the reconstruction of Georgia's massacre for almost a decade now.
The motion is extremely realistic and captivating, a description of the shocking racism that many would like to believe has already disappeared from the United States of today.
It's hard to watch a show, but it's even harder not to see what Greene says is supposed to be.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because we have to face our own dark side," says the director.
"But I can't have a relationship with you if you can't hear me or if you don't want to hear what I've been through."
This year's performance started in June. On the first day about 30 actors - a dozen blacks and twenty whites - gathered to listen to Greene's routine summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's assistant counselor.
He's been playing the local director of Ku Klux Klan for years, but the role is always as difficult and disgusting.
"I feel dirty because I'm not myself," Marbaugh says.
"It is important, however, that this aspect of history should also be kept on the table so that it never happens again."
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsing their lines.
The show starts with a scene where Malcom screams and pushes Hester, and he's furious that Hester's had an affair with Dorothy.
"Didn't you hear me?
Rascona, or Hester, responds.
Here goes the punch.
And then everyone (at least all the black actors) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs the hardest.
"What?" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Did I accidentally hit you too hard?" he asks.
"No," Greene's freaking out.
"I just don't think white people used the word "n---u" at the time.
"Yeah," another black actor confirms.
"It's slang, you need to use a longer version."
The subject of the performance is unpleasant, but the room is dominated by a friend spirit.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just for the performance, but for the memory of those who have died.
It's starting all over again.
Now Rascona's words are killing me.
Nobody's laughing.
The reshaping ends quickly and violently.
Screams, shots fired... and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral dress stands by the bodies and sings a Billie Holiday Strange Fruit song.
His voice breaks every second word.
About 50 viewers a few decades away are wiping out sweat and tears.
Almost half the audience is black and half white.
There is a couple who have come to see a show in Ithaca, New York, but most of it is local.
They have visited the victims' tombs under Brooks' guidance in the oppressive humidity of Georgia.
The murders have changed from story to story, and the atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the song show, Greene invites the crowd to check the bodies.
Children squat to look at fake blood and motionless bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy mumbles like he's to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will be thanking the audience.
Actors who play lynxes take off their robes and wipe tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man who played the local director of Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then bursts into tears after a rough performance.
"Don't worry," the woman in the show is comforting.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason."
Later, the audience and actors gather for a dinner together.
The white couple from Altantas are busy discussing the presentation with the black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski finds it hard to find words when she describes the feelings of the show.
"It's hard to listen to horrible words and watch horrible deeds that are said and done by people who look like you - just because they look like you," he says.
"I was told that lynchings are still happening," he added. "They're just called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights for those sitting at the same table.
He says he's already started planning next year's performance.
"Reshaping is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we have experienced, but it is also an educational experience," says Brooks.
"The message is that this can happen again if we do not learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it."
Scratching vegetables in shops is a thrill: this is what the removal of "excess parts" actually saves on
Is it permitted to remove cauliflower leaves in the shop before weighing?
What about taking out the big hat part of the pineapple - it weighs no matter how much?
The answers are a powerful divider: for one it is a sign of extreme lull, while others do not want to pay for those parts of vegetables that are not used and that go home to the garbage can.
The phenomenon is recognized in stores.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the K-Citymarket department of Ruoholahti, Helsinki, because many people tear the leaves of cauliflower, for example.
From the box, the magazines are taken to biowaste in the store.
According to a news report published by the financial media, "snoozing on a vegetable counter " surprises merchants.
But how much does the removal of additional parts of vegetables before weighing really save money?
How important is it really to snooze?
We ladies tested how the price changes when pineapple, top artichoke, mushrooms, broccoli and cauliflower take off the leaves or stumps.
Florist: The price of a cauliflower costing EUR 2,10 was EUR 1.80 when all leaves were peeled off.
Pineapple: The price of a whole pineapple costing EUR 2.30 dropped to EUR 1.95 when its heel was turned off.
Globe artichokes: the price of EUR 2.60 was EUR 2.40 when the short stock was cut off.
Tasty mushrooms: Two mushrooms cost a total of 75 cents.
Without the heels, the price was 60 cents.
broccoli: Medium broccoli cost EUR 1 and without stock 80 cents.
Result: If you pluck out leaves and heels, save at best a few tens of cents for one vegetable.
In percentage terms, the price of vegetables fell by as much as 20 percent.
A total of EUR 1.20 would have been saved from these purchases!
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona - a Brazilian star signed a five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, reports the news agency AFP.
Earlier on Thursday evening, representatives of Neymar had paid the purchase price of EUR 222 million to FC Barcelona playing football in the Spanish league.
The huge transfer of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
Previously, Manchester United had a record of EUR 105 million in French Paul Pogba last summer.
The Spanish League blocked the transfer earlier on Thursday when it rejected Neymar's first payment attempt.
According to the rules of the league, the company buying out cannot pay the purchase price directly to the seller, but the player must buy out the contract himself, which is done by recycling the money through the league.
In practice, the PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and his representatives who delivered the money via the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is believed to be arriving in Paris on Friday.
He may be introduced to a new home audience at the opening of the PSG season against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa will examine the details.
In its communication, Barcelona also informed the European Football Union (Uefa) that it would provide information on the payment so that it could determine the disciplinary measures that might arise from the case.
Among other things, the chairman of the Spanish League, Javier Tabas, has suspected that the PSG is violating Uefa's rules of economic fair play by spending money.
Uefa can punish a company that loses more than EUR 30 million over three years.
According to Uefa, Neymar's transfer does not automatically break its financial rituals.
Neymar's transfer to PSG will affect the club's economy for several years, but the impact cannot be estimated in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players at considerable amounts, Uefa was announced.
PSG is owned by the state-owned qatarian company Qatar Sports Investment.
The Society is chaired by a former tennis pro, the qatarian Nasser al-Khelaifi.

Austin, 21, got severe burns from a lightning strike. The flash was recorded on the airport security camera.
Austin Dunn was working with a couple of co-workers at the Lunch-Florida International Airport when suddenly lightning struck a plane from rainy skies.
The power of the lightning threw the plane into Dunn's land near the wing.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third degree burns all over his body.
My dad called me and said my brother was electrocuted and he's in the hospital.
I was just asking if she was alive. Austin's sister Autumn says.
Austin spent two weeks in a hospital.
In addition to the burns, he had muscle damage and a brain hemorrhage.
It was a hard experience for the whole family.
You can't expect that.
It's traumatic for everyone," says Autumn.
According to the airport representative, the lightning risk warning system was on at the time of the case and the transport company itself decides whether to comply with it.
Pearson reduces 3,000 jobs and revives business by cutting dividends
On Friday, the British training group Pearson announced that he would reduce 3 000 jobs and cut the dividend by 72% when starting a new restructuring programme in response to the pressure on his business.
According to Managing Director John Fallon, job cuts are mainly made at the end of 2018 and early 2019. The company already reduced 4,000 jobs in connection with previous restructuring plans.
Pearson announced that it would again cut costs by £300 million in May as part of its third austerity programme aimed at revitalising the business weakened as a result of rapid digitalisation.
Last month Pearson decided to sell its share of Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann. The company announced that it would keep its view of the current year, which increased its turnover by 1% in the first half of the year and was GBP 2.05 billion.
Assault on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in a suicide attack.
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Kabul, Afghanistan's capital city, and according to the authorities, a NATO soldier was killed and several others were wounded.
According to NATO statement, five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in an attack in the Qarabagh region of Kabul.
The explosion is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month, and on Tuesday 30 people were killed in an explosion in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday two people died in a suicide bomber attack at the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO's statement, the explosion on Thursday evening occurred when a joint NATO-Afghan army patrol was attacked by an "self-made explosive device" carried by a person.
The statement reported that all injured persons were stable and treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to the correspondents, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organisation in Qarabagh are of major concern to NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul, a region where Shiia Muslims mainly live.
The Taliban announced that they were behind the attack.
On the last day of May, in the centre of Kabul, more than 150 people died in the bombing, which was the country's most devastating attack on the militant group after the forces led by the United States overthrown the Taliban in 2001.
Violence highlights the unstable situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump considers whether the United States is sending more troops to help the local army and the police.
According to the correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul over the last few weeks have also significantly undermined people's confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghan.
EPA rounds out its decision to postpone implementation of the smog regulations
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) passed its decision to delay the implementation of the decisions taken under the Obama regime to reduce smog emissions the day after 15 states had sued the Agency.
According to the Agency, the EPA announced its decision to implement the so-called ozone definitions of 2015 late on Wednesday, which demonstrates its commitment to cooperation with the Länder.
"We believe in dialogue and want to respond to the needs of the states," said Director Scott Pruitt in the Agency's opinion.
In June, Pruitt announced the Agency's intention to postpone the implementation of ozone definitions by one year until October 2018. According to the specifications, smoke pollution is measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution needs to be reduced in accordance with stricter air quality standards.
On Tuesday, 15 predominantly democratic states, including District of Columbia, were sued by the agency, which said that it was illegal to postpone implementation.
President Donald Trump's administration has sought ways to reduce the environmental regulations of Barack Obama's time, which, according to Trump, form part of a broader programme for economic growth.
The measures taken by Trump have been opposed by democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of increased emissions.
According to the EPA website, breathing of air containing ozone "may impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms," such as asthma.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, Isis's leading figure had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
Suspectedly, the bomb was supposed to be taken to the aircraft on July 15, but the company was suspended before the security check.
The police won't give us any more details as to why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a toxic, colourless gas discharge device and take it to a crowded public place, such as a public transport vehicle.
Michael Phelan, Australia's Federal Assistant Commissioner, says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
As a result of suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations will continue.
Managing Director of Liquid: Renewable fuels did well
Oil breeder Neste's profit before taxes decreased but beat the forecasts in the second quarter.
According to Managing Director Matti Lievonen, the company made a good result in oil products, sales volumes of renewable products rose to record levels and the operating profit of the Marketing & Services segment was moving in the right direction.
Last year, comparable operating profit was improved by the US Blenders Tax Credit tax relief.
According to Lievonen, the operating profit of renewable products remained at a good level this year thanks to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and to complete the strategic investments we announced earlier in 2017, Lievonen said in the release.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko discussing a possible match at their first meeting
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match in the near future of a series of less than 66.7 kg, met for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at the ESPN Sports Channel in Los Angeles until WBC's undefeated lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked down the hall to greet Lomachenko, the WBO's upper feather champion.
On Saturday Garcia won the showtime with the unanimous decision of the former four-weight champion Adrien Broner. Since then, Garcia and Lomachenko have been among the top five boxers of different weight classes on a comparative list.
Garcia stretched out her right hand and said, "What's up, champ?
Good luck with the fight!"
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN at seven o'clock on Saturday.
When the duo posed to the photographers, Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas remarked that the match between men would be "perfect in size."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded me.
"I moved up the range for Broner [6.5 kg], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 63.5 kilos.
I want to go back to the lightweight show.
He's gotta get on the lightweight series [61,2 kilos], and then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Let's give them what they want."
Lomachenko agreed.
Boxing needs this fight.
Klimas asked if the match should be organized on the pay-per-view channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomachenko that Lomachenko debuted later this year and next summer fights against Garcia (37-0, 30 knockout wins). Garcia would also be interested to face the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will fight in the lightweight series in Forum on 23 September.
"The fight could be on the pay channel because fans have asked for it," Garcia said and later announced that she was ready to fight on the channel that offers the best prize package.
"We are the most interesting names.
No one else gets so much attention.
I'll be okay as soon as we reach an agreement."
Garcia said she appreciates Lomachenko as an "unbelievable fighter" and maybe she's going to watch Saturday's game.
Lomachenko interrupted Garcia's praise and said that this three-weight champion from Riverside looked "very slow. Sorry, Mike... but you needed that knockout."
Garcia said she focused first on the power of impact and then on boxing.
The men said that they felt that the fight between them was becoming more and more intense.
"This is the fight we're waiting for.
No other match attracts so much attention and interest.
I'm definitely involved in this case," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said he expected to fight the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It's gonna be a great fight."
Average wage 5 300 euros, training what happens - investment advice situation was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has been a lot of talk lately.
Last time Helsingin Sanomat told Ritva, 68, to whom a banker's investment advisor spoke nonsense when selling investment products.
The rules for investment advisors and different sales of investment products will become stricter at the beginning of next year.
The tightening is based on the new MiFID, which will start to apply from the beginning of next year.
At present, the assessment of the skills of investment advisors and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
The law does not define skills requirements.
The financial sector (FA) itself recommends that investment firms carry out their own APV1 or APV2 qualification.
The financial sector has authorized the organisation of qualifications for an APV investment firm named APV investment firm, which has experts from financial supervision (Fiva), universities and industry.
The degrees are 12-15 credits, and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE, Aalto University Executive Education Oy, which provides management development services.
Its website reports that, generally speaking, both exams are "very extensive in terms of requirements."
The study material includes 10-15 books and numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV investment qualifications Oy, says that the pass rate of the tests is roughly 70 per cent.
Of the employees of the largest banks, roughly all providers of investment services have completed either APV1 or APV2 qualifications because they are compulsory under their own rules.
Then there are smaller bankers without mentioning names, whose staff seem to have avoided qualifications," Savikko says.
According to him, there are "a few" bankers like this.
According to Saviko, the APV1 degree has been completed since 2000 by 13 000 to 14 000 persons and more demanding APV2 qualifications recommended to investment advisors.
Some bankers consider the qualifications to be an advantage.
More sectors have considerably stricter skills requirements.
Savikko says that the recommendation in the Financial sector requires the completion of APV qualifications, because it is then that investment-related expertise will be ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisors earn several thousand euros per month on average, including commissions, benefits in kind and bonuses.
The average earnings of regular working hours for monthly wage earners are approximately EUR 5 300.
On average, men who work on the job earn more than EUR 5 900 per month and women earn more than EUR 4 500 per month.
The tithe of the highest earners earns an average of approximately 8 100 euros.
The tithing of the most earning men earns more than EUR 9 000 per month or more, one tenth of the women making the most earning the most earning money earns EUR 6 400 or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
At the level of employees and tasks, self-regulation has so far been relied upon.
According to Fiva, the audit was carried out in individual cases where the expertise and competence of the investment advisor were not sufficient for the purposes of the advisor's activities.
In principle, investment products can also be sold even if their skills and qualifications are at a low level.
In this respect, the situation has been wild and free in the first place.
Several other sectors have considerably stricter skills requirements," Savikko says.
According to Saviko, from the beginning of next year, this will be tightened up with the new MiFID II Directive.
It requires each company to be responsible for ensuring that the personnel providing investment services are sufficiently competent.
Financial supervision, in turn, has been empowered to determine what needs to be done.
Fiva's market supervisor Marko Hovi says that one of the clear changes to the current situation is the regulation on the skills and experience requirements of investment advisors and sellers of investment products.
According to the Court, the new requirements apply both to investment firms' own staff and to tied agents who sell products on behalf of a company.
According to a government proposal from the Ministry of Finance, Fiva was given the authority to determine competence and experience.
What they are exactly will be decided in these visions during the coming autumn.
The company must continue to provide the necessary training and, if necessary, follow-up and further training.
All of this needs to be documented and the company has a duty to demonstrate that this has also been done.
The court states that, in practice, the company must, for example, identify employees' job descriptions at individual level.
There will certainly be different standards depending on whether it is investment advice or product sales.
According to the court, it is also new to have a requirement to work with someone more experienced if the skills or experience are not at an adequate level.
In other words, if the company hires a new employee who does not quite meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person who fulfils the criteria for a certain period of time.
According to the court, with the change, the rules become stricter and more concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will become stricter at the beginning of 2018.
Photo: 787 Dreamliner passenger plane "drawn" a giant aircraft on top of the United States
The flight route was drawn over the United States in Flightradar24.
The flight took place on Thursday 787 on the Dreamliner aircraft where Boeing tested the durability of the Rolls Royce engines on a long flight.
In 18 hours and 1 minute, a plane departing from Seattle flew 15,700 kilometers [700 km], which is longer than any regular commercial scheduled flight in the world.
The flight stayed within the borders of the United States all the way.
It flew through 17 states.
Imatra's persistent beach swimming school students will not be flung by rain or sunshine - Iines Kaikkonen persisted with the help of a swimming cottage village
Iines Kaikkonen made good progress, Taina Itkonen followed.
Imatra's beach swimming schools run in Sludge and Lempuska this week and next week.
Even though it rains and then shines again, young swimmers aren't in trouble, praises the swimmer Taina Itkonen.
In this week's swimming schools, a total of 13 children increase their swim skills, a dozen next week.
The number of children in the coming week was influenced by the fact that the school and the Eskari are already beginning, assessed by Itkonen.
The Imatra Beach Swimming School is organised jointly by the Sports Unity project and the City of Imatra.
On Thursday, there was a nice atmosphere at the Sludge beach.
The sun was shining, and young swim school students were training to stay on the surface with the swim sticks, someone without them.
Smaller siblings also enjoyed the water.
Iines from Kaikko, 5, first suspected going deeper into the water.
However, Taina Itkonen encouraged her to stroll toward the beach.
You're doing great!
Iines Kaikkonen told me that he had been swimming a lot this summer.
He thinks the beach of sludge is good.
Like Iines Kaikkonen, Vili Huhtanen continued to practice swimming with swimming bars, 5.
You too will be pleased with today's achievements, the swim teacher praised.
Jami Kallio, 4, wanted to go to the water war once in a while.
Ilona Villberg, who followed her daughter Anna Villberg, 6, swim from the beach, sees the swimming school as a good start for learning to swim.
No matter what the weather's been like, Anna's always loved to come here every day.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
Swimming school kids packed up on the pier.
The boys were busy with a frog found on the beach.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels to the pier, snacked on fruit and shining the day.
In the water, the education continued, but there was no hurry on the dock.
It's one of those things that doesn't belong in the summer.
The unidentified soldier sells toilet brushes - "Here's a story that connects."
You can see all kinds of things.
A few days ago, Blue Products launched a series of Unknown Military products.
I mean, dishbrushes and laundry racks and a "wc-brush on the edgebrush"?
This autumn, an unknown soldier refers to his premiere film and the marketing of the film.
Yet there is something special about the combination, and the products have been ripped off in social media: When will the Unknown health ties come?
I have to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does Blue Product Vice President Aino Määttä say?
We're the partner in the movie.
We are supporting this film, as are many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film," says Määttä.
According to him, there will be a special presentation of the products, and the film will thus gain visibility.
Isn't there something a little funny about this - often when you think that products and related stories have something in common?
There is such a common story that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products," Määttä says.
According to him, the company supports the same basic Finnish values that are supported by those who have seen the old Unknown soldier.
And cleaning is no stranger to military culture," Määttä points out.
Other partners in the unknown soldier film include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
So far, for example, the Vichys of Hartwall have been placed on the market, which are named Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unknown products had already been cleaned by Suomen Kuvalehti's blogist Kalle Kinnunen
Coffee and watches are also available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time to premiere the film, so there is still time to follow up.
For example, Valio, Processor, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen, have not yet revealed their war products.
New results of Swedish age tests for asylum seekers were published
The latest results of the Swedish asylum seekers' medical age tests have been published, and the results of the tests carried out using the new evaluation method reveal that more than 80% of those tested were determined to be over 18 years old, but not everyone believes that the tests are reliable.
The Swedish National Agency for Legal Medicine started testing earlier this year.
The tests will allow a more accurate assessment of the age of the asylum seeker, and a new test was introduced following criticism of the Swedish Immigration Service for failing to determine the actual age of applicants claiming to be minors.
The Finnish Immigration Service has commissioned 6,880 tests so far, and the results of the 2,481 tests have now been published by the Legal Service. The tests were carried out between mid-March and the end of July 2017.
Eighty per cent of those tested, i.e. in 2002, were found to be over 18 years of age, and 25 cases were identified by the OHIM as "possibly 18 years of age or older'.
In 432, it was concluded that the asylum seeker was "possibly under 18 years of age."
Tests were carried out only in cases where there was reason to doubt the age indicated by the applicant.
Johan Göransson of the Department of Legal Medicine reports that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The bones are quite uniform. There are no big differences in the statistics of previous months," he told The Local.
Although a large proportion of applicants were determined to be over 18 years of age, this does not necessarily mean that applicants lied about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of the 581 tests and announced that 442 cases had "references to the fact that the subject was 18 years old or older'.
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it appeared that in 243 cases the applicant had openly stated that he would be 18 years old this year.
The medical age evaluation method used in the tests takes X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRIs of the knee joints, then dentists and radiologists analyze the images, and the method has also been criticised.
One of the skeptics is Karolininen Institute's endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work includes an assessment of human biological maturity, which can be used to determine whether a person has reached puberty earlier than usual or later.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I believe that the method used is not the right one.
Defining biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't determine age for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can," he said to the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Department of Legal Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of determining a child as an adult is small.
The risk is greatest in a situation where the test will soon be 18 years old, with a risk of about 10%."
Happy collapsed 30 places in Scotland
In the third round, the five-over-par result spent 30 sections of Mikko Ilosen on a bottom-down performance slide in a European golf tournament in Scotland.
Ilonen left Saturday day in 11 places divided, but found 41 places to share at the end of the tour.
In difficult reels, Ilos had one double bog in the company of three bogs.
The others were having a hard time too.
An Englishman named Ian Poulter rose to share the top position in one less than a par round, even though he said that there was plenty of work to do on the umbrella holders.
The weather was raw, but I hung with it and eventually the day was good, Poulter thought.
He shares the lead with his countryman Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
The governor of West Virginia is changing parties.
On Thursday evening at Trump's campaign event, the democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced that he would change the party.
"Democrats simply abandoned me," Justice said.
"Today I can tell you after many prayers and thorough reflections... today I will tell the West Virginians that I can no longer help you as Governor of Democrats."
The crowd broke out with a lot of applause.
"Tomorrow, a registered Republican party member," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time for a new game."
Trump promised earlier that a major announcement would be made at the campaign event in West Virginia.
Trump won by 42 points in West Virginia because Justice did not support the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016. According to Forbes, he's the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited a mining company from his father and owns coal mines in five states.
His assets are worth about $1.59 billion.
On Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement that "the change of the Governor Justice is yet another blow to a democratic party that would rather build obstacles than better America."
"Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, Justice's announcement is the latest setback for a party without any leadership and unable to find a positive message that unites people," Ronna McDaniel, RNC representative, stated in his statement to the CBS news.
Lightnings have sowed damage - Thursday coming even summer's tough thunder day
From the end of the week there will also be more thunderstorms in southern Finland.
During the past week, thundering has occurred especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Varsinais-Suomi.
On the night between Wednesday and Thursday, several fires were sparked by lightning strikes.
According to meteorologist, Thursday may be the worst day of the summer so far.
Thunderstorms have finally found Finland too.
During the past week there have been lightning especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Varsinais-Suomi.
On the table, lightning hit the power center of a row house, causing a small fire.
The rescue department received a report of a fire about 15:45 a.m. on Wednesday.
The electrical center was located in the sauna room at the end of the terraced house.
The rescue department unraveled the roof and wall to find the fires and quickly extinguished the fire.
Eleven apartments were left without electricity, but personal injury was avoided.
On the other hand, in Loimaa, lightning set fire to the flames of the outside building on Harjulantai before midnight.
By the time the rescue service arrived, the building was already in full phase of the fire, and the rescue department had no choice but to prevent the fire from spreading.
An outdoor building about 50 square feet [50 sq m] burned to the ground.
In Kuopio, on the other hand, lightning struck a detached house in Rääkkylä.
The people of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flashing lightning strike.
The rescue department was there to check the case, but this time the lightning did not create a fire - only a few fuses were fried.
In traffic, thunder caused problems on the train track between Seinäjoki and Vaasa when the lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
On Thursday morning, between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m., trains were replaced by buses.
It was not until just before five in the afternoon that the problem was resolved.
Since then, train traffic has also continued normally on the thundered line.
Lightning has caused devastation throughout Finland.
However, lightning has been relatively low this summer.
This summer's thunder has been a total disaster! assessed by Meteorologist Jari Tuovinen, who is on call at the Meteorological Institute.
The thunderstorms of Wednesday and Thursday have been mostly moderate in intensity, but thanks to the little lightning salto of the summer, it also feels strong to many.
This might seem like a real thunderstorm, but that's what it's been like compared to this summer's thunderstorms," says Tuovinen.
On Wednesday, the marshmallows blew up 1,700 times, and Thursday has had potential even for the toughest thunder day of the summer: by about 4 p.m., there were 1,790 marshmallows in the balk.
If the lightning continues until the beginning of the evening, more than 2,000 lightnings can be reached, Tuovinen is foretold.
The previous record low lightning year was experienced in 2015, when the lightning volume of the year was about 30,000.
By Wednesday this year's lightning rate had risen to 18,386 flashes.
So there is still something to be taken up so that this year does not break the 'high record' two years ago.
But you can expect the thunderbolt to continue.
According to Tuovinen, the air mass over Finland will also remain warm and humid during the rest of the week, which is a suitable birth environment for thunder.
The main focus of the thunderstorms is likely to be on Saturday, south of the northern parts of the country, where some 2,000 lightning days can be obtained on both Saturday and Sunday.
There will be a more united rainfront in central parts of the country.
According to Tuovinen, there's only a few thunders in such things.
Coe praises Russia's "open-minded" apology for the doping scandal
The world's athletic boss Sebastian Coe praised his open-minded apology for the anti-doping scandal on Thursday, but Coe added that it was not yet time to lift the ban on Russian participation.
On the eve of the World Cup, on Thursday at the IAF Congress, the Russian athletic director Dmitri Shlhtin said that the ban on Russia was appropriate and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry "for all the athletes who were taken from the races for a gold medal or silver medal."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of continuing the ban. Russia was excluded from the athletic competitions in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA's report provided evidence of state-supported doping in Russia.
"I think his answer today was very direct; it was a very open-minded presentation," told the journalists.
"The whole Council and Congress welcomed the fact that the Russian Athletics Federation admitted that the country had gone through difficult times and announced that it would do everything it could to reorganise its activities."
Mr Coe also said that he was "happy' that Russia accepted the conditions for ending the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the Group's recommendation that this is not the time to end the ban on Russia," said Coe.
"In the coming months, we will have to do everything we can to normalise the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes compete with neutral athlete status in London at the World Athletic Championships starting on Friday. They have met the strict criteria of IAAF.
Rune Andersen, director of the IAAF Task Force, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet a number of requirements before its status can be restored.
"The testing is still insufficient and the banned coaches continue to operate freely," he informed the journalists on Friday after a presentation to the IAAF Council in London.
The production company was disappointed by the poor success of Tom of Finland film
Tom of Finland did not become the success the authors hoped for," says Yle.
Honestly, I'm disappointed, admitting that the film was produced by the CEO of Helsinki Film Annika Sucksdorff Yle in an interview.
I was afraid that a Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film was premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached more than 100 000 admissions, which is little compared to the film budget, about EUR 5 million.
This didn't turn out to be a lottery win, but now it's important that investors get theirs back.
If the film had succeeded better in the home country, they would already have had their money.
Now we have to wait for small brooks from overseas distributions," says Sucksdorff.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoskoski.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's transfer to Paris
The rules restricting the spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from being transferred from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain, France, the most expensive player of all football.
Its possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by UEFA, which regulates European football, which can prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced the financial rules for fair play, according to which the PSG must be able to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer has been financed without major losses.
EUR 222 million were paid to Barcelona for the termination of the Brazilian agreement, and Neymar's annual salary in the new company is in tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France involves a wide range of economic aspects.
The PSG has no difficulty in paying Neymar's transfer money and linking him to its starguard, as the company is financing the Qatari oil-rich dynasty.
The clubs are allowed to spend large sums of money on the acquisition of players, but they need to be balanced with real sources of revenue so that the football business is not loss-making.
The financial rules for fair play were drawn up at the initiative of Michel Platin, who was elected President of UEFA in 2007.
As a former soccer player, Platini felt that the pursuit of success through indebtedness was cheating and led to serious problems if the banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the focus of the Fair Game's financial rules shifted from the debts of clubs to the monitoring of their losses.
The change meant that Roman Abramovich's first business model in Chelsea in 2003 became significantly more difficult to implement. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge sums on player procurement and created a worldwide brand.
The current three-year review period of the Fair Game Financial Rules will run until 2018. During that period, clubs will be allowed to make a loss of up to EUR 30 million.
Although my Platinum had to abandon the duties of UEFA's president in 2015, his successor, Alexander Cefer, also wants to curb the reckless spending of clubs.
"The rules of fair play are still in place and we will continue to apply them in the future," Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the financial rules of fair play in UEFA, told the Associated Press news agency last week.
Even though the PSG paid Neymar out of its contract with a lump sum, it may amortised the amount in the accounts for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has entered into a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be booked as an annual expense of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years.
Based on the financial rules of the fair game, the first sanctions were distributed in 2014. The biggest sanctions were imposed on PSG and Manchester City funded by Abu Dhabi.
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was later reduced to EUR 20 million. In addition, the club was ordered to limit its Champions League team to 21 players for 2014-2015 instead of regular 25 players.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to circumvent its financial rules by increasing their income through companies associated with the club's owners.
For example, if the company in Qatar supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be above the normal market level, UEFA does not calculate the aid as the actual result.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the support of the Qatar Tourism Authority for PSG was excessive.
It has also become apparent that some of Neymar's merits in the PSG could be financed by fees available from the Qatar World Cup Organisation of 2022.
However, the PSG and the Organising Commission have banned Neymar from being an ambassador for the World Cup, and it would be very easy for UEFA to reveal such an arrangement.
Due to previous PSG sanctions, UEFA is monitoring even more closely than usual attempts to circumvent the rules.
On Thursday, well-informed sources told us that UEFA has not negotiated with the PSG on Neymar's transfer.
Sources gave an interview to the Associated Press news agency on the condition that their identity is not disclosed because they do not have the authority to discuss the situation of the PSG.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG's net sales for the period 2015-2016 amounted to EUR 542.4 million and operating profit to more than EUR 10 million.
The financial statements for the last period have not yet been published.
The PSG expects Neymar's arrival to attract new sponsors and increase sales of company products and jerseys.
The Society estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30% with the Neymar Agreement.
The Spanish League, clearly irritated by the departure of one of the world's best players, tried to make Neymar's transfer difficult, allegedly violating the financial rules of a fair game.
"This is a clear case of economic doping, both for the club and for the state," said Javier Tabas, President of the Spanish League, to the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the qatarian ownership of the PSG.
Arsenal's manager, Arsene Wenger, also has reservations about the government funding the football club's activities.
"The case is the result of ownership that has completely changed the football environment over the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"Everything is possible after the state owns the football team.
It will be very difficult to comply with the financial rules of the fair game. There are so many different interests related to the fact that the famous player represents the state."
Now we're in a hurry: Coach of Finnish World Championship athletes stuck in Helsinki
The long jumper Arttu Pajulahti and the three-wayer Kristiina Mäkelä's coach Suren Ghazaryan are stuck in Helsinki, even though he should train at the World Sports Championship in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
Pajulahti will compete tomorrow for a long jump and Mäkelä on Saturday for a trig leap.
However, the two coach, Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa for Great Britain.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with it in the British broadcast without success.
The coach has the invitation of the organizers of the World Cup as a documentary, but this has not been enough to obtain a visa either.
I wonder if this is one of Brexit's first symptoms, or what, coaching director Jorma Kemppainen said.
He has always successfully handled visa issues himself in the past, but now there are some problems.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports Federation (SUL) for years.
It doesn't matter that much.
As long as someone at the stadium looks at the steps, Arttu Pajulahti said that his coach might have missed out.
World Championship Medal for Finland London requires a miracle
The World Athletics World Championships will start in London today on Friday and last a good week, ending on Sunday 13 August.
Athletics, cross-country skiing and hockey are the species that Finnish athletes are able to take passionately from year to year, whether successful or not.
In the hearts of bench athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course there are other indicators.
Less attention will be paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one value contest to another, where the acquisition of experience will mature the athlete's performance to the level that the adult World Cup medal is genuinely possible.
Now there are no such young athletes on the small Finnish World Championship team, or even conquerors.
The World Cup Medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the fascination and surprise of sport is that miracles can happen.
It draws bench athletes to the TV screen and glues to the races, even though the London medals are solved due to the time difference until late in the evening.
Finland received one bronze medal from the previous World Championship in Athletics 2015.
It was brought by the spear thrower Tero Pitkämäki.
The darlings are waiting for the Pitkämäki medal even now, although the results of his and other shooters' recent performances and the fact that Pitkämäki stays at the prizes last summer.
No matter what happens in these competitions, Pitkämäki will be a great Finnish sports hero in history.
For other Finnish athletes, access to the final competition or making your own record is a good enough performance.
Hope and faith in the realistic medal hunt of Finnish athletics in the coming years will give a good success in the international values competitions of young people this summer.
The breeding of young talents and financial support for its work are more important than maintaining a small group of athletes of representation.
Success does not come instantly but requires years of sweaty work from athletes and patience from both training and bench athletes.
Finns can also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
Hopefully, the London Games will go down in history as the Games of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not because of, for example, the terror of terrorism or cowardly attacks.
Enni Rukajärvi second in Copper's Big Air - "But I'm sorry."
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi is second in the big air race in Colorado, USA.
Copper Mountain's number two is Rukajärvi's best big-air world cup.
The women's race was won by Jamie Anderson of the United States.
Rukajärvi scored 147 points in the competition.
On his last jump, he tried the caballerial 1080 for the first time in the races, and that was very close to succeeding.
I feel good now, and I feel good now, but I'm sorry the last jump didn't go quite well.
Yeah, I'm gonna try it again in the races from now on, inch Rukajärvi.
In the big air of snowboarding, a competitor jumps from a jump made for the sport.
Viking Line's new high-speed craft was frozen in the harbour in Helsinki
The new fleet company Viking's new speedship FSTR is seriously behind schedule.
The fast ship had to leave Helsinki for Tallinn at 6:00 p.m.
The ship was loaded around eight o'clock.
The ship arrived in Helsinki late.
At least an hour and a half I've been waiting to get on board.
Now the car queue moves slightly, Johannes Rebane of Estonia waiting for boarding at the harbour of Helsinki told me at 7.30 p.m.
Rebane thought there might have been a technical malfunction on the new ship.
Rebane told us that the shipping company had brought water bottles for those waiting for boarding in their cars.
Viking's Communications Manager Christa Grönlund tells IS that there was a technical glitch on the edge.
It was repaired in the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a few hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be delayed on Tallinn's return trip for a couple of hours.
The ship had to leave Tallinn to return to Helsinki at 8.15 p.m.
42-metre special transport disrupts traffic on Sixth Street on Thursday night
The 42-metre-long special transport moves from Muukko to Mustola harbour during Thursday evening.
Transport leaving at nine o'clock should be there by 11:00 p.m.
Police are controlling traffic on Route Six, and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
From the paddle, transport will proceed along Route 13 to the port of Mustola.
Small circle nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
At the same time, the story is looking for the great days of characters in the '80s and the grunge of the '90s (in those days David Wain and Michael Showalter made a great series of The State sketches for MTV) and their own time - in 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars of the series moved on to bigger things in their careers.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the continuous remembrance that we are stuck in during the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it feels like a lifetime ago.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (including the background story of the vegetable can speaking in H. Jon Benjamin's voice).
The core of the joke is that middle-aged actors act as lustful teenagers approaching adulthood, highlighting it makes reaching the past impossible part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults play adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: it parodys, for example, stalker movies of the '90s, such as the horror movie The hand that rocks the crib.
At one point, one of the characters digs up Apple Powerbook, inline roller skates and "other stuff from 1991."
Many of the stories are the same as before.
The kindhearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but is still not over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And one crazy plot involves Ronald Reagan (so-called Michael Showalter) as his accomplice, George H.W. Bush (who plays aptly Michael Ian Black).
As always in a series like this, the best are side paths.
It's especially fun to see a young man named Paul Rudd, who has a beard knob under his lower lip, Matt Dillon's "soul patch" from the movie Singles.
The moments of random madness may lift this series into flight as a sort of recursive Seven Up! series until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer - Twenty Years Later. In its final scene, a group of friends will go to the opening of the Wet Hot American Summer movie.
The Amazon's Comrade Detective series, on the other hand, appeals to a different nostalgia: the Cold War spirit of The Americans, the Atomic Blonde movie, and even the GLOW series button tower, where the East meets the West.
The comedy series has been created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Rhys Thomas. It has been made into a Romanian police drama in the 1980s where a Bucharest cop couple fight for truth, atheism and Marxism-leninism.
Their lines have been dubbed in English by Channing Tatum and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
But that's all it is.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (policemen spend time watching chess on television the same way Americans watch football).
There is a group of famous sound actors including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
However, Comrade Detective gets caught too much to imitate the clumsy socialist drama - with, for example, the killer hiding behind the Reagan mask. Therefore, the series often starts to feel like clumsy propaganda.
Six long periods are too long, and the humor of the series is not fast enough or abundant.
In a nutshell, the series might work better as an Agitprop satire, for example when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the United States Embassy and there are always two fat men in the lobby eating hamburgers.
The message to the imaginary Communist public is that Western culture can make everything consumer goods and fast food.
The imaginary Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: we devoured our own recent history and their history.
Toni Tauru from Kouvola rises in the ring in Macau on Saturday - facing a former UFC fighter
Toni Tauru wants to keep the fight going.
Toni Tauru is getting a hard bone in Macao, as the Brazilian Leandro Issa still fought at the UFC organisation last year.
The Brazilian also has the black belt of the jujutsu and the world championship of the sport.
For once, I'm fighting myself against an older man.
It's a funny story. 32-year-old Tauru tells me.
The Kouvolaan was supposed to get into the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three struggles were quickly brought to the Chinese Autonomous Community in Macao.
Tauru has never encountered such a thing before.
This was the first time my fight was canceled.
It annoyed me because it took a lot of time to prepare and train.
However, the fighter is pleased that a new date has been found for the struggle.
Waiting for a week has little to do with preparation.
The transfer doesn't affect the condition, because it won't improve in a week.
It could get worse if you practice too much.
Tauru has faced opponents whose strengths are in standing up in a few previous struggles.
This time things are different.
Issaa of Kouvola describes her as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
My guess is he's gonna come on hard in the first round and try to take it to the rug.
He's won the Jujutsu World Championship, so he can wrestle.
Kouvolan's last fight didn't go as planned.
Kevin Belingon, a Filipino, hit Tauru badly in the eye, and the victory remained in the Philippines.
I've never fought so well, especially standing up: he didn't get a single shot.
When I started pouring, he hit my eye angle.
It really hurt me for a long time.
New Motivation
Some of the free fighters fight once a year, some get into the ring more often.
For example, Issa, a future opponent, last fought in September.
The Tauru, on the other hand, had three matches last year.
This is the second battle this year.
Sometimes the pace has gotten pregnant.
In recent years, I've been practicing and being in good shape the whole time.
But all I've fought for is fighting.
When a 32-year-old heard of a future encounter, he decided to change the scenery for a while.
I was in Espoo practicing, and I got the joy of doing it back.
We got some really good practice with this guy from Sweden.
Training was a great help, for on Saturday the Kouvolainen will have to prepare for a physical struggle.
I've been able to train against opponents of the same size and practice a stand-up game.
Fighting upright is the main tactic of a 32-year-old.
You have to hit him rationally.
If there's a chance, I'll take the property myself.
Naked exports must not be given free of charge, as they consume the most.
Macau is attracted to Tauru, who has been fighting in China before.
They say it's Chinese Las Vegas.
I think there's gonna be a big, great evening ahead of us.
The Bank of England holds interest at 0.25 per cent
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates unchanged when economic growth has been vigorous and inflation has stopped speculation on interest rate increases.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue at a slow pace, and that the Bank has shifted interest rates because of the increasing pressure on the income of families.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank's Monetary Policy Commission decided by a vote of 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25 per cent. This month, the interest-rate increase gained less support because economic growth has been unrelenting.
In its quarterly inflation review, the Bank decreased its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and its forecast for 2018 to 1.6%. It also warned that there was increasing pressure on household income, as inflation is expected to increase further by close to 3% in the autumn.
According to the Bank, however, interest rate increases will be needed in the coming years to curb the inflation rate driven by Brexit, and the Bank indicated that the cost of the loan could have to be increased more than expected in the financial markets.
In addition, the members of the Commission decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package that began a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will terminate the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide £15 million more favourable financing to banks through the Programme, i.e. a total of £115 million.
The Protocol to the Bank's decision on interest rates states: "The Commission for Financial Policy predicts that the slow development of gross domestic product will continue in the coming years as households' real income decreases consumption'.
As regards interest rates, the Bank reiterated the need for "some tightening of monetary policy" to contain inflation "a little more broadly" than expected by the market.
The market is currently predicting a first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and a second one in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increases were "gradual' and "limited'.
In May, the bank predicted an increase of 1.9% for this year and a growth of 1.7% for next year.
It now maintained its growth forecast for 2018 at 1.8%.
The pound weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the pound decreased by 0.5 per cent and amounted to USD 1.31. Compared to the euro, it decreased by 0.4 per cent and was EUR 1.11.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was taken after lower than expected growth rates weakened expectations of higher interest rates. GDP grew by 0.3% in the second quarter and by 0.2% in the first quarter.
The Bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter but to pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation survey gave little hope to households suffering from rising inflation and low wage increases, which, according to the bank, will deteriorate even before it gets better.
The Bank added that monetary policy "can't prevent" declines in revenue over the next few years, but it expects a "significant recovery" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by a strong increase in demand for British products as a result of a weak pound, which will reverse part of the fall in private consumption.
The decision was taken one year after the reduction of interest rates to 0.25 per cent following the shocked outcome of the EU referendum, which plunged the pound into decline.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to be reflected in prices and in the economy only after four years.
Before the most recent decision by the Central Bank, the demand for interest-rate increases had become ever louder as inflation was exerting pressure on households, with three decision-makers calling for an interest-rate increase of 0.5% in July.
Inflation declined to 2.6 per cent last month from 2.9% in June, but according to the bank, it was expected and inflation will tighten again in the coming months.
According to the Bank, its 2% target was exceeded by a "totally" weak pound.
"In view of the recent decline in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market would appear to intensify when creditors are feverishly seeking customers and wanting to end the year strongly," says Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"Markets look particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is ending. Renewing contracts are increasingly popular, their interest rates are low and there are also non-usual alternatives available."
NHS prescribes 10 000 controversial HIV medicines
As of September, patients can be prescribed a "transverse" anti-HIV medicine, and the Supreme Court concluded the dispute over the financing of the drug in the English public health system (NHS).
NHS reported that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is prescribed to approximately 10 000 people during the first three-year experiment, and pre-natally administered drugs have been shown to reduce the risk of transmission by approximately 86% in individuals at high risk.
The NHS agreed to finance the experiment after the Court of Appeal upheld the Supreme Court's ruling last year, according to which the NHS is able to pay for the PrEP, although claiming that it should be financed by local authorities.
Simon Stevens, director of the British NHS, referred to the decision announced on Thursday as "significant new intervention' and was described by the national AIDS organisation as "solving for an important moment'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to start taking up a trial that will expand in October to other clinics. The experiment will reach its full potential in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an anti-HIV medicine taken prior to intercourse that reduces the risk of transmission.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infections in risk groups.
A medicine taken before sexual intercourse means that during sexual intercourse there are enough drugs in the body to prevent HIV infection.
The medicine can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The target group for treatment is homosexual men, bisexual men and transgender people and people with HIV-positive partners who are not receiving effective treatment.
The clinics choose candidates who qualify for the trial from men, women and transgenders as well as those who are not known to receive antiretroviral therapy from HIV-positive partners.
People living in England who have registered for the treatment of a general practitioner can also apply for an experiment at their local sexual health clinic.
The programme costs GBP 10 million and this week the NHS in England signed a contract for medicines following an international tender.
The purpose of the experiment is to assess the potential of PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its targeting, taking and treatment implementation.
"This important new intervention should complement and enhance the existing diverse and increasingly effective means of preventing HIV," says Stevens.
"That is yet another significant achievement in the struggle that has been going on for more than 30 years to solve one of mankind's greatest health challenges."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," says Deborah Gold, director of the national AIDS organisation.
"If PrEP is correctly targeted at those in need and those at risk, it can have a turning effect on the HIV epidemic in England.
As of September, those at risk will receive a drug, which they can decide on independently without having to negotiate with a partner, through an experiment funded by NHS, which will have an empowering effect that will improve the lives of a great many people.
This was welcome news."
"The most important thing now is to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly throughout the country and no one in the risk group is excluded," says Ian Green, Director of Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The Prep medicine used for testing has been acquired and we will soon be able to protect ten thousand people at risk from HIV infection."
"The start of the PrEP experiment is a welcome event that took several months of unnecessary time to slow down the government," says Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health of the shadow government.
"We have evidence that the medicine can have a turning point in our work to prevent HIV and to stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment will help us to better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the experiment be launched as soon as possible throughout the country, so that we can protect those exposed to HIV and get one step closer to the situation where the spread of HIV in society has been halted."
Quality of life: the middle layer and smart interior solutions have made the small Earl's Court apartment a spacious home
The former banker Joanne Leigh, enthusiastic about renovating properties, moved from the Knightsbridge residential area to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of Queen Anna's Era-style house. Joanne hasn't packed her stuff yet and moved.
"Before this, I lived with my ex-girlfriend in a much larger apartment in Knightsbridge," Joanne says.
"I'm looking for something similar in my price range.
I went to this apartment show and found that the rooms were as tall as my apartment back then.
I immediately fell in love and made an offer on the same day."
Since then, about 90 square feet of apartment has undergone a complete transformation.
It was a two-bedroom with only access to the bedroom from the kitchen. Joanne wanted more storage space and an interlayer to make use of the room height.
"I wanted space, big windows and a lot of light.
Those were my demands," he says.
He hired Erfan Azadin from the Notting Hill design office Duck & Shed. Erfan was assigned to use the space of rooms that were nearly four metres tall and to create an apartment that would not only be a renovation and sale site but a home.
The room height was not quite enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an intermediate floor where you could stand.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfan.
"The steel structures are quite complex.
The farms had to be arranged on top of each other so that there was no need to crawl over them.
The structures had to be modified so that the height was just right both on and under them."
Erfan was able to place two fully-high rooms on top of each other with fascinating details.
On the interlayer opens the copper window of Retrouvius in an elegant lounge.
Mirror-gold furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille's vintage luminaires create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, feeling of space and light.
Mirrors at both ends of the short corridor make the corridor seem longer than it really is.
The mirror in the middle of the kitchen is like a window with a view to another room.
Mirror-shaped furniture at the entrance has storage space for Joanne's meals and glassware.
More elegance is that the kitchen can be hidden when it is not used.
Kitchens with folding doors are not a new solution,
But in Joanne's kitchen, it is unique that the door should be lifted up in the same way as the garage door.
"It took a bit of planning," Erfan says about a steel reinforced veneered MDF door.
"It is balanced, i.e. it slides very easily when lifted into place."
With rational use of space and planning of storage space, Joanne received 16 extra square metres, a second bedroom and a better floor plan.
"When you sell the apartment, the area determines - or the value of the property," Erfan says.
"In the basic case, the real estate agent walks into the apartment and calculates the price based on the area."
At Joanne's apartment, the area was increased by using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
"The resident is in contact with the materials of the dwelling, and the emotional connection to the dwelling is partly based on them," Erfan says.
"Nobody gets attached to electrical wires on walls.
They are important too, but not in the same way."
Joanne's apartment is an example that good design and extra squares can make the basic dwelling exceptionally nice.
It can also happen that you no longer want to move out of the apartment.
Pregnant Princess Sofia shone in her summer look.
Princess Sofia's choice of costume was a perfect match.
Princess Sofia was represented in Båstad Sweden for the last time before her birth.
For dinner at the A Sustainable Tomorrow event, the princess had chosen a delicate light blue dress.
Sofia represented him at the ceremony, smiling.
Princess Sofia of Sweden has visited Båstad in Sweden this week.
On Wednesday afternoon, Sofia was represented at the A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a gorgeous blue body-like outfit that was gorgeously dressed by a pregnant princess.
Sofia came to the event in a dark blue outfit.
This is the last representation in which Sofia represents before her birth.
His due date is September.
For dinner, Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel - blue dress that landed wonderfully.
The style was crowned with large earrings and a stylish little bag.
The pastel blue dressed nicely for the princess.
Sofia has been on a representative trip to Båstad in Sweden this week.
Sofia supplemented her outfit with a small bag.
Sofia was radiant in her fresh summer look.
Sofia was even interested in talking to photographers at the event.
Now I just hold my belly, Sofia laughed and pointed to her final pregnancy.
He's gonna raise us with a sweet chili.
In the summer of 1996, a booth appeared in Lahti Square where Thai food was sold.
The Lahti people didn't have the guts to taste it. They walked by.
In the booth, food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Penttilä, among the acquaintances Panja.
He didn't know much Finnish, and the Finns didn't know Thai at the time.
Since the people were afraid to go to dinner, Panja offered free tastings.
This is how he taught the Lahti people to eat Thai food, spring roll at a time.
Taste it, she said.
I got hooked.
I went more and more, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened its Thai cafeteria in the Lahti Market Hall.
There were two small tables, I think there were less than 20 customer seats.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food but also to sit next to a stranger.
When you are hungry and places are limited, you cannot leave an empty chair between yourself and a stranger.
We were getting to know each other better and became friends.
Finally, I sat at the plate with the dictionary learning Thai.
Two years went by the grocery store, but then the restaurant had to move because they said they smelled too much in the gym.
There's a new place at the end of the grocery store.
There's plenty of room.
Now we lawyers get to sit at our own tables again, only in the most crowded times will we have to shyly ask strangers if there is room next to them.
Panja knows her clients.
He'll be briefed on what's been going on and who's been seen.
He knows what food each eats.
He has seen how the customer's life cycle varies and the food club changes.
She remembers the first spring roll I ever had with a man by his name.
He remembers me when I was skinny and fat, and he remembers how I was when I was young.
It's nice to have lunch a little later than everyone else, sit in my seat next to the kitchen door and catch up with Panja, who leans on the counter.
Food isn't the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationality with sweet chili sauce.
In addition to our senses of taste, he has opened our thoughts and hearts.
Today many speak Thai to him - thanks to the increased popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though he's had a hard time, he's always kind.
He's a hard worker.
He goes to the restaurant and goes to the fungus and the blueberry.
Last week, the restaurant was quietly celebrating the two decades.
We customers got strawberry cake for dessert.
Without a fuss or attention went this remarkable day, at work.
The discovery of a subterranean base revealed 173 Isis terrorists who were ready to strike in Europe
Early in the year, the security authorities had access to a list that was important for the fight against terrorism.
The list contains information from over 170 Isis fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are 173 people and the document includes not only their personal data but also pictures of each one.
More than 130 of the people on the list are Iraqis, but there are also six Europeans.
They come from Belgium, Holland, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhikistan and Saudi Arabia.
The evening Sanomat told me about the list and a couple of weeks ago.
Now the location of the list and the information contained therein have become more precise.
According to the paper, Iraqi Army Special Forces found a list of terrorist personal data and photos while investigating a terrorist organization's underground base in Mosul.
The U.S. intelligence authorities assessed the authenticity of the papers and sent them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
In the background there was a fear that something big and serious would be planned in the West by terrorists after Isis fell in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and pictures of all persons but also the date of their birth, the invented aliases and information about the person's country of origin.
The list also identifies the specialties of terrorists.
For example, for the 27-year-old German named Sami J., Abu Assid al-Almani, or German, is on the list.
He is reported to have left Germany in 2012, traveling first to Egypt, then Libya, and later through Turkey to Syria to join the ranks of Isis.
There's a suicide bomber written as a specialty next to his picture.
There's no more specific information on what happened to him.
A total of some 6 000 fighters from Europe have joined the ranks of Isis, whose fate is uncertain.
The man fell below the surface in Tokoinranta, Helsinki
According to the interviews with the rescue department, the man had wanted to show him he was strong enough to swim.
Even a bucket can save a drowning life.
In Tokoinranta, Helsinki, a person who was underwater was rescued on Thursday.
According to firemaster Ville Estlander, on duty at the Helsinki Rescue Department, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found under the water about 15 minutes after the report.
The rescue diver found him beneath the surface," Estlander says.
The rescue department received a report after half past four this afternoon.
The person was delivered to emergency care.
Estlander says it was a man about 50 years old.
Based on the interviews, the man wanted to show him he could swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is already over.
Estlander commends the government's cooperation with the Border Guard and the police.
It was a mission led by the Border Guard.
The divers were also very well guided by those present.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the Border Guard and the police.
Two cars crashed in Eura - nine people in cars, three were seriously injured.
There were a total of nine people in the cars, the rest of whom suffered milder injuries, says the on-call fireman.
Among the injured are both men and women.
The accident took place at the intersection of three roads around four o'clock in the day.
The crash occurred when another car turned from behind the warning triangle in front of another car, says the on-call fire marshal.
According to the Rescue Department, there's a 50-mile-an-hour speed limit on the intersection.
The brothers are fighting for more than $500 million in real estate.
Two brothers are arguing about Victoria's largest real estate empire, worth over $500 million, a family business founded 40 years ago by their Italian family.
Former president of Carlton Football Society and real estate developer Colin De Lutis lives in the Toorak region just three houses away from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has brought a dispute over the division of property and business property between the brothers to the highest court.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter dispute over the divorce.
The brothers and their mother, Anna, together own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The family began to build up property when they bought a store on Collingwood Smith Street in 1973.
The family started a Westco Jeans store there, which expanded into a chain of 160 stores.
The retail chain was sold for 85 million dollars in 1999.
The money was used for real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, housing in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburb shopping centers.
According to the agreement with the deceased father of the family, Colin owns about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul owns about one third of the company's assets. Paul describes his father as "the carrying force and central figure of the family."
According to court records, the distribution ratio means that Colin owns properties worth approximately $ 316 million and Paul $176 million.
Paul's not happy with the distribution of property and money.
"I think Colin left the best properties for himself in his proposal," Paul wrote in his first sworn testimony to the court in 2015.
The case was first dealt with last Friday in the Supreme Court after several mediation attempts.
The brothers are now also arguing about who controls the existing business. Paul claims that Colin has ruled him out of business.
According to Colin, this is not true, and he blames Paul for the poor management of some properties.
Colin writes together of his first sworn testimony that he would like to find a solution.
"In accordance with our Italian traditions, family matters to me," says Colin in his statement.
There are hundreds of pages of sworn statements, e-mails and reports on this case that are being investigated by consultants such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who established milk bars and delicacies in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s they bought a shop in Brunswick.
They were used as collateral when the family bought a real estate in Collingwood where Colin founded the first jeans store in the family.
Colin says he started a shop "in the last years of high school when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis tells us that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer the properties to their sons in a friendly manner.
"Luigi often said that she doesn't want the brothers to end up in court," Anna writes in her statement.
The other two sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the business of the De Lutis Group. According to Colin, Mark received $10 million and Luke 26 million when he left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are "bitter about the economic conditions of their departure."
Colin has kept a low profile even though he is a former member of the board of the Australian Football League and the best friend of television star Eddie McGuire, according to this biography that appeared in 2015.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin answered, and in his text message, he told me that he couldn't comment on it because it was being dealt with in court.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag our family into a legal battle," he wrote.
In mid-2016 Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to comply with his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted us to fight like this," Colin went on and said that he was still hoping that a solution could be found.
On Friday, hope seemed to have passed out.
"Our case will be settled in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new head of staff is planning to limit the use of the President's media.
The others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally succeed.
First.
According to Poltico magazine, the new Chief of Staff of the White House intends to limit President Trump's media use and news monitoring so that the boss does not get into so much trouble.
Reporter Josh Dawsey reports:
"When John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with management staff on his first working day, he raised a key problem that he intends to solve: he intends to restrict information to President Donald Trump.
Kelly told the White House workers that all the information - whether printed or heard in press conferences - must pass through him because the President makes better decisions when he gets good information."
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit the use of Trump's media and failed.
President Trump has a relationship with television for decades, and as president, he still watches a lot of television.
"If President-designate Trump was nervous about unfair news, it was worth showing him that the sympathetic media handled matters more fairly," said Sam Nunberg, an advisor to Trump's campaign, to Politico in February.
At that time, politico's journalist Tara Palmer wrote that "six former campaign workers say that it is essential to control the use of Trump's Twitter that his personal media stream includes a steady stream of praises."
Okay.
But it's ridiculous to say that the use of Trump's Twitter would never have been under control.
Maybe these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don't know - maybe Trump's tweets would have been even more wild without their efforts.
We'll probably never know what kind of messages Trump missed.
If his staff has at least been able to prevent him from causing problems a few times, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has been able consistently to prevent Trump from causing a fuss.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are rival groups in the White House who are trying to push their case by providing Trump with information that supports their view, which can be reliable - or not.
In May, Politico wrote that counselors deliberately provide the President with questionable information.
Reporter Shane Goldmacher told me about an incident:
"Trump's current and former employees say that he can become furious about newspaper clippings where he is criticized - especially if they tell about harmful data leaks - and then he has to know where the data came from.
That is what happened at the end of February when someone mischievously gave the President a copy of the news of GotNews.com, founded by Internet Provocator Charles C. Johnson, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of several White House information leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter for harassment and had previously spread false accusations and withdrawn them later, and he did not provide any concrete evidence either.
Nevertheless, after reading the story, Trump had started asking the staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that Reince Priebus, then Chief of Staff, and Rob Porter, Secretary of Staff of the White House, 'had tried to introduce a system for the management of documents to Trump'.
And what was the result?
Kelly's gonna try the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants continue to pursue their own affairs.
These unchangeable facts make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Neymar signed a five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, reports the news agency AFP.
Earlier on Thursday evening, representatives of Neymar had paid the purchase price of EUR 222 million to FC Barcelona playing football in the Spanish league.
Neymar's agreement with Barcelona had therefore been dissolved and was free to move to the Parisian Society PSG.
The huge transfer of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
Previously, Manchester United had a record of EUR 105 million in French Paul Pogba last summer.
PSG is owned by the state-owned qatarian company Qatar Sports Investment.
The Society is chaired by a former tennis pro, the qatarian Nasser al-Khelaifi.
Neymar is believed to be arriving in Paris on Friday.
Success writer Raija Oranen beat alcoholism and fear of flying with hypnosis: "I'm in good shape in my life"
From the TV series Rose Time and Clean White Sheets, well-known success writer Raija Oranen just celebrated her 69th birthday.
Hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
Five grandchildren hold grandmothers so gripped by writing that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola's apartment after 18 winters.
At first they sold their house, but now a rental apartment also left in the spring.
In the light and the sun, out of the old circles, Raijan once took the depression and alcoholism that he has survived.
Even the outward appearance is 20 kilos lighter.
The weight went down when the serotonin drugs were stopped, they were mood medicines.
At one time, I was helped by hypnosis, which also worked on fear of flying, and I won it.
I've been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes people away, the radiant author says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been on the same journey for over 45 years.
I feel better than I've ever felt.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who worked in the tourism industry, have been together for over 40 years.
I proposed, and it was getting married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
That's the kind of drama queen she's always been, quit her life like that, Jyrki laughs at his wife.
Oranen, who has made a great career as a writer, only remembers the clean white sheets of the 44-piece TV series that touched and moved Finland during the recession.
I finally finished the clothing industry at the Rakka family company when I read Liisa Seppälä's 50th anniversary interview on the plane.
I was the daughter of a sucker, and my mother also had a clothing store and sometimes acted as a mannequin," Oranen recalls.
He felt that the plot of the series and the story changed the attitude of Finns towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen's research and thesis revealed it," Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives as an active writer, has many manuscripts to work on - hundreds of ideas.
The circlers returned across the ditch to the alley of the millionaires.
The wealthiest homeowners in West Midlands are again in the hairnet with persistent tours who managed to cross the ditches dug by the municipality and return to the field next to the houses.
The circulars parked their twenty caravans near a street called the Alley of Millionaires in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross a moat that was needed as a transport barrier for the municipality, bringing with them children, horses and an army of vans.
The circulars managed to cross the passage barrier at a point that had been left unprotected because of the path.
Infuriated residents have accused the municipality of Solicull of "perfect inability to solve the problem."
An anonymous resident tells us that on Monday evening, visitors came from Bentley Heath, where they had thrown rocks at passersby.
"The municipality must be bullied into action because it seems to be completely incapable of solving the problem.
The circulars were here in May, then they left but returned again.
There were more of them tonight and probably even more of them today."
The resident reported that the municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by denying access to the parks.
"I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it is frustrating to pay municipal tax when the municipality is unable to do anything about it."
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the Visitors returned so soon after being driven away.
"There's more of them than before, and they've even landed in a horse-grazed park."
According to the municipal spokesman of Solihull, the municipality is aware of the illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal steps with the Solihull police to evict the campers as soon as possible.
It is very important for the collection of evidence that as many locals as possible report disturbing or criminal activities to the police.
It will help create an overall picture of the situation for legal proceedings."
Angry people surrounded the Portuguese crash machine
In Portugal, men who crashed on a crowded beach have been interrogated today in court.
As a result of the forced landing, two people died yesterday.
Two men who have flown a plane could be charged with manslaughter.
In Portugal, you can receive 16 years in prison at most.
Yesterday, due to a technical glitch, a small aircraft that was flown by men had to land on the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica near Lisbon.
There were hundreds of people on the beach at the time of the event, some of whom were running from the landing plane to escape into the water.
The plane landed on a 56-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl who died instantly.
The plane first hit the man in the back of the plane.
Immediately after that the plane rose up and, as it landed again, it hit the child's head, told Filipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias, who was on the beach.
The little girl who was killed was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents weren't hurt.
Those on the beach surrounded the small plane right after the accident, angry.
The girl's father and other people went to the plane and began to beat it up, reported the case in Celia Rocha Correio da Manha.
He called the pilot a criminal. He was desperate.
It's a miracle no more people died.
The two men on the plane weren't injured during the crash.
Another Finnish star who tragically lost his leg won World Cup gold: "If it weren't for an accident, I wouldn't be a world champion"
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated Finland's time for World Cup gold in a banked slalom in a competition held in Big White, Canada.
Great Hamari also won the Cross World gold in the races earlier.
All in all, three World Cup titles have already been accumulated.
It's a pretty amazing World Cup!
Two times were treated with gold, with a pretty good heartbeat pulled, the call-reached Great Hamari rejoiced.
The 30-year-old calculator thanked his coach and very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Greater Hamar, the number of challengers in the sport is increasing all the time.
The whole paraluminal surfing has grown and developed a lot lately.
Differences are decreasing, and there are a lot of new calculators involved.
You're always wondering if there's a black horse coming out the back.
Every race seems to have a different winner.
Great Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had been zealously counting with his friends since he was young, and calamity didn't want to get on the slope.
It reminds me time and time, what my life would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that there's no point in saying "if."
Those cards are used to play what has been distributed," says Suur-Hamari.
It would be cruel to have a serious accident and a loss of limb for luck, and it is not the Great Hamari.
But he turned the terrible trouble to his advantage.
Yes, I would say that the situation turned out to be a victory.
I wouldn't be a three-time world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, Big Hamar, 23 years old, had already lost the greatest enthusiasm for boarding.
The job wasn't really started until after the accident.
When I was young, I used to work out with my friends, and we were always so excited about the X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that dimmed somewhat over time.
After the accident, I found myself somehow in that X-Games starter.
I couldn't have imagined it before.
I was 23 years old and I thought, "This is gonna be a really long life if I stay here and be bitter and sad."
I decided to put my jumpsuit on and get to work.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
Leo-Pekka Star's selection as a year's athlete was a great pleasure to the calculator.
A four-time Olympic winner won his prize at the sports gala held in January.
According to Great Hamar, the Star's victory is an important signal for the parasport people.
It was a really big deal, and the victory was definitely earned.
This will certainly also open the eyes to the parasport world.
When's the time to launch the two-time world champion Matti Suur-Hamar's annual athlete campaign?
We'll see about that in due time.
I'm trying to do my best to succeed.
Great Hamari has not yet conquered all the peaks he desires.
Next year there will be a great goal.
A year from now, there will be the Paralympic Games in South Korea.
We're going to get a medal!
The majority of Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently unless the war ends and Isis leaves the country.
The A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study examined the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees baked bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youths do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently.
According to them, the end of the Syrian war and the departure of Isis is the most important thing that should happen so that they can return to their homeland.
The Trump regime is not seeing any change in the Syrian conflict.
Burson-Marsteller, a network of communications agencies, investigated the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
Burson-Marsteller has been studying the opinions and attitudes of Arab youths for nine years.
This year, the A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 young Syrians aged 18-24, half of whom are women and half men, responded to the survey.
Half the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their country of origin permanently in the future.
42% of respondents might think they were going back to their country of origin and 4% could not say.
According to the study, the decision of young people to return home is most affected by the ongoing war in Syria and the presence of Isis in the country.
Nearly half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most important factor for a permanent return home, while the quarter believes that the most important thing would be to leave the country.
Only less than one tenth will make the improvement of the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria the main factors influencing the decision.
Military action alone will not solve the conflict
Syrian youths were asked what is the most important factor in ending the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of war is more important than the overthrow of President Bashar al-Assad.
A fair quarter thinks Al-Assad's presidency is an obstacle to a peace agreement.
Almost half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to end the conflict in Syria that is now under way.
The only way to resolve the conflict is through military action alone... is to believe in a good quarter.
The majority of Syrian refugees see Isis' power weakened in the last year, while the fifth feels its power strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important thing in the fight against ISIS, and generally against terrorism, is that the media should inform people that ISIS have nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many made military measures and training reform a priority.
Fair tenth thought the most important thing would be to create better paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the impact of the Trump regime on the Syrian conflict, 66% of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during the Trump regime.
Almost one in four believes that the conflict in Syria will get worse during the Trump period.
Opinions are divided as to whether Russia and Iran's involvement have improved or aggravated the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half his time encoding to keep the Internet in order - his database is used by Wikipedia and Google for example
MariaDB, a company in Espoo, is developing the "fastest growing" open source database in the world.
The main product of MariaDB, established by Michael "Monty" Wideneius, does not cost users anything and can be developed online by any good programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they may not be paying customers.
With databases, huge data masses are kept in order and quickly available.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, they use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that is not in image format comes from the database, and the images are also linked to it," explains Widenius.
Widenius, the technology director of MariaDB, spends about half his time encoding.
The man who works remotely from Kauniainen will help to ensure that the Internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database MySQL together with Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun bought MySQL for a billion dollars, and a year later the software giant Oracle devoured Sun with 7.4 billion.
When the Oracle store took place, a large proportion of the developers at MySQL announced that they would leave.
"They didn't want to work for Oracle, who didn't promise a certain future for MySQL," he recalls.
At this stage he had already set up a company that began to develop MariaDB.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired about 20 of Sun's best developers to make sure that the continuity of the code was secured by the same friends who created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop it into its own branch.
I just had to change the name.
A foundation was set up to monitor the development of the MariaDB code.
"During MySQL these confirmations were not made," Widenius laments.
Although many have heard of Widenius and MySQL's billion-dollar trade, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
"Last years our growth rate has been around 50% per year," says Kenneth Paqvalén, CFO of MariaDB.
MariaDB, which focuses on growth, does not yet make a profit, and Paqvalén is limited in terms of the company's key figures.
He reveals that during this financial year, MariaDB estimates that it will receive EUR 20 million worth of orders.
As the database is free of charge, the company has developed services around it that business customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps to exchange databases, which can be more than a year's work if the customer has used a closed database.
From MySQL to MariaDB, you can switch to MariaDB instantly because they are versions of each other.
The Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank in South-East Asia, DBS, among others, are paying customers of MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services such as Amazon's AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alibaban Cloud, offer their customers MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB will automatically spread to new users in distribution packages of Linux operating systems where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we're a small company, we have connections with the biggest players.
"Our customers include the world's largest telecommunications operators, gaming companies, banks and even some central bank," the Paqvalé list.
The database market is still dominated by giants such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP on closed databases.
For Oracle, MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company's traditional closed database.
Although according to the research company Gartner, the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, in terms of turnover, players such as MariaDB are still insignificant, albeit fast growing stints.
In the $50 billion database market, open source databases can't even reach a billion.
However, the weight of the open source code cannot only be measured in money, as most users do not pay for these software.
Research company Gartner predicts that in 2018, companies will already develop more than 70% of their internal applications on open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been exchanged at that time, or at least the transition would have started.
Large companies do not get new customers because most of them choose the next open source code.
This has led to licence fees for commercial databases being skyrocketed.
Companies want to make as much money as before with a smaller number of customers," says Widenius.
Given the difficulty of switching a closed database, the majority of customer companies have absorbed price increases in obedience.
"There are a lot of customers for whom switching is really difficult because their old apps and others are closed in a closed database," says Widenius.
He still believes that the customer's measure is coming up.
When licence fees rise each year, the customer will sooner or later move to an open source database.
The price is between 10 and 20 per cent from before, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if he wishes.
Moreover, many companies are facing major system changes when transferring their activities to cloud services.
At the same time, many change database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received a loan of EUR 25 million from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the largest growth funding the EIB has ever provided to the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide and is now planning to hire more.
One of the reasons for the EIB's financing was the impact of MariaDB on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector customers, for example in Britain and Germany.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros annually from databases.
"Many countries want to switch to open source solutions and use tax money more efficiently," says Paqvalén.
Widenius regrets how money is wasted on closed healthcare systems in Finland, for example, when open systems are cheaper and the client is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say that open source is ideology, but I think it's a better way to make code.
The community is helping and doing things that you can't think up or do.
55-year-old Widenius is one of the most famous open source promoters along with another Finnish developer, Linux Torvalds.
Widenius helps other companies develop functional business models on top of the open source code.
I still give 4-5 speeches each year around the world on this subject.
Italy is intensifying its attitude towards civil society's rescue vessels
Italy has warned non-governmental organisations, which on board their vessels rescue refugees in the Mediterranean Sea, that they must not continue to operate unless they undertake to comply with the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not commit themselves to a new code of conduct, it will be difficult to see how they could continue to operate," said Minister of Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came the day after the Italian authorities seized the German aid organisation Jugend Rettet, whose crew was suspected of cooperating with human smugglers to promote illegal immigration.
Only a year ago, the aid organisation refused to comment on the detailed charges brought by the prosecutor, Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing. We are very sorry that we are currently unable to operate in the search and rescue area," the organisation announced in a social media statement.
"We can only judge the accusations once we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the Iuventa vessel of Jugend Rettet since October.
It is suspected that the crew has taken boatloads of refugees directly from human smugglers who have re-entered the boats.
One such incident is alleged to have occurred only a few kilometres off the coast of Libya, and the information is shown in the prosecutor's document, the content of which has been published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of defying the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer who supervises the operation.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue activities have so far agreed to comply with the Code of Conduct: Save the Children and Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
who announced on Thursday that he considered the new rules to be unnecessary but acceptable because they did not cause "significant changes or obstacles" to the organisation's rescue activities.
Among those who refuse to comply with the Code of Conduct are Nobel Prize-winning Doctors without Borders.
Minniti, for his part, said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks, as he sees it as a sign that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local mayors are beginning to produce results.
"In the last few days, light has begun to appear at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He revealed that there are plans this month to continue discussions with Libyan mayors on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving for Europe.
Seasonal worker suspected of killing his cohabiting partner at Enontekiö, suspect found in the field - case to the prosecutor
Suspected crime occurred in Kuttase of Enontekio last December.
According to the police, a 36-year-old Czech man is suspected of killing a 26-year-old Scottish cohabiting partner.
In the past, it has been reported that both were seasonal workers.
Police have also reported that after what they did, the suspect would have fled with two dogs to the terrain.
The man was found cold in the terrain and did not resist when he was apprehended.
We're gonna have to press charges in less than a week.
The case may be pending at the District Court of Lapland until August.
Robert Hardy, known for Harry Potter and all my hairy friends, is dead.
British actress Robert Hardy has died at 91.
The actor's death was announced on Thursday by his family.
Hardy, born in 1925, began his acting career at the age of 24 in the theatre.
During his long career, he also played in movies and television.
Hardy is especially remembered for the role of the Magic Minister Cornelius Toffee in Harry Potter films and for his role as a veterinarian in my all-haired friend television series based on James Herriot's book.
The popular series of the BBC was filmed through a total of seven seasons.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to imprisonment for text messages inciting suicide.
A woman in Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for text messages and calls that were considered to have incite her boyfriend Conrad Roy to suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, is serving 15 months in prison and five years on parole.
Carter was convicted of murder in June, and his boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said at Thursday's session.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter filed an appeal against the judgment and had to wait for the application to be dealt with in freedom.
He was facing a 20-year sentence, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy are suffering from mental illness.
Carter, dressed in red pants and a cream - colored blouse, listened to his judgment with his hands crossed with a tearful look on the ground created.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court.
"He ended Conrad's life to heal his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the act," the prosecutor continued.
"He hasn't shown any remorse."
According to Carter's lawyer, the case was due to "the shocking circumstances that Carter deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz felt that Carter's "age or maturity level or even mental health problems had no significant impact on his actions."
The prosecution read Conrad's mother's statement, Lynn Roy, in which the mother told me that "it won't take a day to mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I'm gonna get through all this. I'm gonna try my best to comfort his sisters in this pain we're always gonna bear."
Conrad's sister Camdyn Roy told the court that she was "stalked" by the idea that she would never see her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
"It's painful to lose someone who's been in my life every day since I was born, and that pain will never let go," Camdy said.
The case appears to be a precedent, since there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that inciting suicide is a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a car in 2014.
The case attracted national attention when it became apparent that Carter had in his text messages encouraged his boyfriend to commit suicide.
"Hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself. I don't know, there are many ways," Carter wrote in many of the messages he had sent to Roy during the two weeks before his death. Roy was on vacation with his family.
Just before Roy killed himself, Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention with Roy's death, and the judge ordered that Carter not benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has shared the views of experts.
Only a few have defended Carter, one of the defensemen is Amanda Knox, 30, convicted of the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007.
The Los Angeles Times published Knox's opinion in which he said: "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison."
Secretary General of NATO: Relations with Russia the worst since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has deteriorated clearly, commented NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think it can be said that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War," Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
However, especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continuing instability caused by Russia in the Eastern Ukraine region, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to doing so so so that tensions do not peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid any escalation and another cold war.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, U.S. President Donald Trump found that the relationship between the United States and Russia has even reached a dangerously bad level.
Mr Trump called for the poor relations between the countries to be congratulated by the Congress which approved the new sanctions against Russia last week.
Audi makes changes to the 850 000 diesel engines due to the setback experienced by car manufacturers
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW offered to update the software of over 350 000 cars.
The director of BMW said that the company believed that "there are more sensible alternatives than driving restrictions', referring to European cities, including the home town of BMW in Munich, which are considering restricting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that he would make changes to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies said anything about a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly marketed diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to achieve CO2 emissions targets.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The cost of installing equipment that neutralises emissions increases, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are being closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of accompanying large car companies and ignoring problems.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes. Volkswagen installed scam equipment in cars that reduced emissions to comply with the regulations in the tests. During normal driving, emissions were higher.
A number of Volkswagen leaders have been charged in the United States, but their actions are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month the former head of the Audi engine development department for thermodynamics was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be handed over to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen. The authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in its cars to circumvent the European emission requirements, based on a similar study in the United States.
Audi's investigation could significantly undermine Volkswagen's position: the share of the luxury car manufacturer in Volkswagen's profits is disproportionate.
The Venezuelan vote began with a fraud investigation, major demonstrations on the road
According to the company, the number of voters declared by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the actual number of voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a company which has no role in the election results, the Chairman of the National Electoral Commission, Mr Lucenan, said to journalists.
Maduro assures us that the crisis will end
On Sunday, in Venezuela, a controversial vote was held on the election of a delegation to amend the constitution of the country.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised protests against its amendment.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed its own demonstrations so that they would be in progress at the time of their appointment.
According to the newspaper El Pais, on Wednesday evening the national security forces began taking over the country's parliament building.
The troops are supposed to ensure the safety of the appointment ceremony.
Climate change threatens Provence lavender
Lavender has become a symbol of the region of Provence in southern France, but now it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender had been reduced due to drought and disease - bearing insects, and scientists and farmers are feverishly trying to find a solution to the problem.
"Lavender is directly threatened in the Provence region because it has suffered from the effects of climate change in recent years, which has led to a marked drop in the rainfall of spring and especially autumn," says Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Institute in Provence.
"This will shorten the life span of the lavender.
In addition, drought has brought a lot of small cascades into the area that spread microbacteria."
The stakes are high.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and it is also a highly desired fragrance and cosmetics ingredient.
"Instead of long gleams and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed, weakened or missing altogether," says Chaisse.
"In other words, there are fewer parts containing essential oil."
The solution is sought by improving irrigation, slowing down the evaporation of soil moisture and spraying with a mixture of clay and water that protects plants, and by developing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The murder of a journalist is an expression of a growing threat in Mexico.
Once a week's newspaper, Riodoce, usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss the most recent cases of organised crime, corrupt authorities and endless drug war in Sinaloa State.
Today, however, security is being discussed because of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been asked to change their daily routine.
Two experienced journalists are discussing which is safer: leaving children at home or including them in the delivery of the grenade attack in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the chalkboard at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They're asking journalists for names for each group, and no evidence is needed, enough observations and feelings.
They write the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected of being on the payroll of government or drug cartels who make Mexican chaos life-threatening.
According to the reporter's Protection Committee, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012. There are 589 journalists who have been attacked and threatened under federal protection. At least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states this year.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder of Riodoce, journalist and inspiration.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
He is deeply missed even though he is present everywhere. The facade of the Riodoce building is covered by a huge picture of Valdez showing the middle finger. It says, "Ricence." The 30-year-old journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are wearing T-shirts with the smiley face of Valdez. Valdez has glasses and a branded panama hat.
The meeting will take place less than two months after Valdez's death, and journalists will discuss their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia and their fears of paranoia.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor was set up specifically for the handling of journalists' cases, but according to the Journalists' Protection Committee, only two charges have been filed so far.
The murderers of journalists rarely go to court, as well as thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime each year, only a few end up in court.
Riodoce's journalists intend to continue writing about the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are devastated and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security conference is of little use because the killers are not known and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is, frankly, a waste of time," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know why."
On 15 May 2017, Valdez had left Riodoce's delivery in the capital of the state of Culiacan.
He had only driven a couple of blocks away with his red Toyota when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and fired twelve shots. The number is supposedly related to the name of the magazine: Riodoce means the twelve river.
The shooter drove off in Valdez's car and crashed it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was saddened by her wife and two grown children.
Rumors move fast and walk freely in Culiacan.
However, Valdez's death will be kept quiet.
Sinaloa has been one of Mexico's bloodiest battlefields since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January. Competing factions want to fill the void.
In the streets of Sinaloa, someone or several people are shot to death daily, and the cemetery has two - story, decorated burial buildings of drug barons larger than the homes of many.
In the coastal state, there is a "peaceful" situation when only one cartel controls ports and routes to the United States of America.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and leader of Riodoce, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to the murder of Valdez.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez, leading a rival group that is at war with Guzman's sons.
The story may have pissed off Guzman's boys: customers suspected of being members of the gang bought every issue of the magazine as soon as the magazine came to the sales points.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper that published the same article was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in the violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career in Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to set up five colleagues with Riodoce. The magazine's shares were then sold for $50.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem," says Bojorquez.
Over time, the magazine became familiar with its bold and honest stories, and its sales and advertising revenues increased.
Journalists appreciated the opportunity to publish hard-core investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by articles that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its creation, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for its news in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez received the International Freedom of the Press Award of the Journalists' Protection Committee for his courage to follow the story of the Mexican drug trade without letup.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to move on," he said when he received the award of the Journalist Protection Committee.
Drug trafficking is a "lifestyle" in Sinaloa," Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"The editor has to accept a mission that falls upon him... or act stupid.
I don't want anyone to ask me where I was when people were sowing death here - why didn't I tell me what was going on?"
Riodoce's staff needs Valdez, a joker who swears like a port worker, and they need a friend who always gave them a hug and advice, and they need a teacher who knows how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He always wore a panama hat.
He went across from the delivery at El Guayabo and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if his routine was fatal.
The death of a colleague has also caused them to wonder how best they can do their job and survive.
"Crimemen don't like it if we deal with their women and children in our cases and their pure business activities, their secret drug traffickers.
They were left out of the case," Bojorquez says.
At best, it meant strong self-censorship and self-preservation.
trusting your own instincts.
If you feel like things aren't right, you have to stay away.
According to the Riodoce journalist Andres Villarreal, the problem is that "the impression can be deceiving, and that is what happened in Javier's case."
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The environment is constantly changing.
No cell phones were allowed to be brought into the room where Riodoce's security training was held. A few days earlier it had become apparent that only the spy programs sold to governments had been followed by activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two policemen had sought shelter in the shade of a tree from the heat of 40 degrees Fahrenheit.
The state government had ordered them to guard Riodoce's premises, which are located in a four - story building in the middle class Culiacan area.
Some of the reporters wondered, half by half, if it was these two policemen who were among the 50 percent that the governor of the state did not believe to be reliable.
It had been months since reporters had visited the mountainous countryside dominated by drug gangs.
For this week's issue, Riodoce's delivery planned three main events.
The greatness of boxing Julio Cesar Chavez's brother had been killed in Sinaloa.
The paper also intended to reveal that the government's spending was concentrated in the governor's hometown.
In addition, one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, just a block from the DA's office, had a group of people kidnapped.
There was no official record of who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to proceed with caution: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug dealers and authorities.
The reporter found out from public documents that the restaurant was registered as a politician of the ruling institutional revolutionary party (PRI), which has dominated Mexican politics at all levels for almost a century.
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous cases in the same place. In one of them, the son of "El Chapo" Guzman managed to escape and avoid an army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that Valdez's column would provide reliable information on the abduction.
"In the past we would have known what had happened," says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has been nicknamed "El Flaco," Thinkainen because of his slim body structure.
"Now all communications with our informants are out."
Valdez's office has been transformed into a warehouse that keeps signs and stickers against the persecution of journalists. The newspaper's employees have received a new, unexpected assignment: they have become journalists for freedom of the press.
The journalist Miriam Ramirez took a few signs with him the following morning, leaving for a demonstration in front of the local prosecutor's office due to another murder of the journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the Western state of Michoacan three days after the murder of Valdez.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found, which, based on the DNA tests carried out by the authorities, is Adame.
Journalists have started protesting louder throughout the country. SOS Press texts appear on the sidewalks and buildings.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is seeking international support for the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez met with the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists because they told the truth.
He has since asked to be removed from government cases because he is concerned that his anger cannot be objective.
Mr Valdez had repeatedly stated that in Mexico journalists were surrounded by organised crime, authorities allowing crime and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Narcojournalism Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed by politicians and security forces in agreement with organised crime.
According to Articulo 19, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out by the police and the authorities.
"In Mexico people are silenced by killing," Ramirez says.
Murders have a crippling effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
At his body was the message signed by the Zetas cartel, "I'm here for my writings."
Next to his severed head was the computer keyboard and headphones.
Some of the newspapers have decided to close down, as did the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua following the murder of Miroslava Break in March.
Some will continue their activities, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, even though its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a message to drug cartels on his front page: "What do you want from us?"
Some reporters have fled their states or the whole country.
It's a difficult decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile and must be on guard at all times.
Sometimes criminals searched for a journalist, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who continue their work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra - once to be a poet - admits that writing about drug trafficking scares me.
"I became a reporter because Mexico is on its way to hell," he says.
Some time ago, Riodoce's reporters sat in front of the delivery at midnight on the sidewalk with a beer when the magazine's latest issue was completed. Suddenly their phones started coloring as a signal.
In the shooting between rival gangs and security forces, 19 people had died at Mazatlan Beach resort.
The war accelerated, as promised by the cartel messages found in the area.
Journalists posted the news on Riodoce's website from the sidewalk on their smartphones.
The front page had to be redone the next day.
The sirens were howling in the neighborhood... another shooting.
Bojorquez took a look at the cops guarding the shipment:
If they were afraid, they covered it very well.
Riodoce's delivery continued the tradition of the murdered founder of the magazine underneath this massive portrait, where the man shows the middle finger to all of Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says he can't even think about shutting down the business. "How could I shut down the paper when our intern asked me to go out on the street and do a story the same day Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project began with a huge setback - "Hard place"
In April, Hannu Manninen, who was 39 years old, had a short party, as a professional pilot began preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the training period began catastrophically when Manninen contracted the flu.
It began a long period of sickness that lasted almost five weeks.
May practically went completely when you were sick.
At first there was a cold and finally a childhood disease like an ear infection that forced me to take an antibiotic course.
I was only able to make 10% of the planned exercises.
I can't remember the last time I've been sick for so long.
It was a tough time when I couldn't take advantage of my training enthusiasm, Manninen tells Evening Words.
Test result collapsed
The 2007 World Champion did not receive an internship licence until the second week of June, which was reflected in the KIHU Racing Mat test carried out on 12 June.
In the test, the athlete skis on a rug, whose speed is increased every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the carpet stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a lactic acid sample of the athlete's fingertip with a needle.
Last autumn I held out on the carpet for 32 minutes, but now I only stayed for 28 minutes.
Against the wall, Manninen tells me.
For the better.
After the initial difficulties, Manninen tells me she's staying healthy.
I have performed a variety of peaceful aerobic exercises to normalize the body's metabolism.
Now there's a really good five-week period behind us.
Midsummer was also a week and a half off from flying.
My family and I have plenty of time to go to the cabin.
Last season Manninen took part in only four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Home Championship.
The best result was first seen at the opening contest when Manninen rose to 18th on top skiing.
Guidelines withdrawn
Manninen and the head coach of the national team, Petter Kukkonen, have drawn up a training and competition plan that extends until February next year.
We are now seeking a different rhythm compared to the last season.
After the first snow race, Ruka would have a weekend of three World Cups.
In December, the intention would be to participate at least one weekend of the World Cup, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January, plans should still be on the table in Seefeld.
Hopefully after that, the name will be on the Olympic team list," Manninen says.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would already be Mannisen's sixth Winter Olympics.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, the Nummela in Salt Lake City in 2002 celebrating gold in the team competition.
The dinosaur protected himself from his enemies by masking himself.
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Now researchers have revealed the first research results of a creature the size of a rhino found by a Canadian miner, so well preserved that experts call it Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.
It had survived so well that scientists could even determine that its scaly skin was reddish brown and had had a "problemic past."
According to Current Biology, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur and one of the best representatives of its species in the world.
The recently discovered fossil is a nodosaurus, which lived in the middle of the chalk age between 110 and 112 million years ago.
Researchers view this amazingly well - preserved fossil as a truly significant discovery.
According to National Geographic magazine, an armored vegetarian is the best preserved fossil of all time.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011, and it was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that didn't seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock and decided to study his discovery more closely.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrell.
There for six years, the beast was dug out of a 100 - pound block.
The results of hard work are now visible.
"If you squint, you can almost believe it was sleeping," says science writer Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Royal Museum of Tyrrell.
"It will remain in the history of science as Mona Lisa of dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and preserved dinosaurs.
Skin studies revealed that meat - eating dinosaurs were likely a major threat to this vegetarian, even though it had a tank and resembled a walking tank.
Its red - and - white armor disguised it from predators, and it was also protected from the surface by darker and lighter coloring, which still exists in many animals.
According to experts, it was thus better able to mix with its surroundings and avoid its enemies, the larger dinosaurs.
110 million - year - old Nodosaurus rose to the headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrrell.
Scientists have named it Borealope after markmitchelli museum technician Mark Mitchell. Mitchell was part of a team that took over 7,000 hours to dig up the dinosaur.
Nodesaurus has survived so amazingly well that Mitchell and an international team of scientists have been able to determine its body scales and armor patterns and shape.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by general coloring, where the body is darker and lighter underneath.
The observation was still a surprise, as Borealopta is considerably larger than the animals today with similar coloring.
From it one can conclude that dinosaurs that eat meat preyed on it to such an extent that evolution favored hiding as a means of survival rather than fighting.
These animals, such as deer, zebras and armadillos, have similar colorings, which are much smaller and therefore easier to catch, suggesting that the Nodosaurus was also seriously threatened.
"The predation of a large, heavily armored dinosaur tells how dangerous the dinosaurs of the Cretaceous period were," Brown says.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the Nodesaurus scales reveals that its skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaurus in order to draw conclusions from its life, including studying its bowel contents to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Scientists believe that when it died, it fell into the river and drifted to the sea where it sank on its back to the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is today in Florida, and the rivers and seas were likely to extend far beyond what they are today.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable because its scaly leather has survived and has also survived three-dimensionally in its original form," says Brown.
"That's why it looks almost the same as in the early chalk age.
It doesn't take much imagination to grasp it: if you squint a little, you can almost believe it was asleep."
The chalk age was the age of the theropods, the huge two - legged, flesh - eating dinosaurs.
Although their king, the Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years before Boralopella, its mighty predecessors may have preyed on this armored dinosaur.
Among the predecessors of the Tyrannosaurus Rex were the Acrocantosaurus, a six - ton monster about 11.5 meters long.
The latest findings of Nodesaurus researchers have been published in Current Biology. They believe that Borealope washed into the sea after his death and mummified in the mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011, and it was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world's best preserved armored dinosaur with leather and armor from nose to hip.
The Nodosaurus averaged five meters [5 m] long and weighed up to 1,300 kg.
There were two three - foot - tall spikes rising from their platforms.
Scientists believe that this armored vegetarian passed through the present Western Canada until the flooded river carried it out into the open sea.
Its armor has survived to little detail in the undersea grave.
Its fossilized remains have survived so well that its skin remains in the armor - bumped plates along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic that such preservation is "as rare as winning the lottery.
The more you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
The bumpy plates of its skull armor still contain fossilized leather.
Its right forefoot is on its side, five toes up.
I can also calculate the scales of that sole."
How did one activist learn to answer the question: Who do the streets belong to?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on 9 August 2014.
She had arrived a day earlier in New York from her home in St. Louis and sat on her airbnb apartment bed browsing Facebook on her phone.
That's when he noticed the message from his high school buddy:
"Police just killed an 18-year-old kid, and his body is still on the street."
Confused, he noticed that no one else had posted the same information into his feed, which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had numerous retweets from the user @TheePharoah.
The username belongs to a rapper living in St. Louis who tweeted in real time about Michael Brown's death, a white policeman who had shot an unarmed 18-year-old black Brown in Ferguson, Missouri State.
The user had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put his phone away, and when he returned to Twitter later that night, it was reported that people were gathering on Canfield Drive.
Users posted photos of police shutters and screaming people, as well as the man who claimed to be Brown's father, whose sign said, "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell followed a live video of a policeman standing in front of protestors with a dog barking.
He also tells me he saw a video where the other cop tuned his rifle and shouted, "I'll kill all of you... animals."
"This isn't normal," Ferrell remembers proving.
"It wasn't the kind of murder we're already used to and could be called typical.
That's when I felt the chills.
I was angry and I cried."
He booked a return flight home for the next day.
The plane landed at 11:00 a.m. and Ferrell went to pick up his six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they would leave for Ferguson the next morning.
About what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next nearly three years, a documentary film "Whose Streets" has been made. It was premiered at the cinema on 11 August 2017.
The film is a story of survival and expression, love and loss, as well as strength and perseverance from the point of view of the local people who went to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove toward Ferguson in a flower dress and his daughter dressed in a compatible crown, they had another conversation about "what it is to live in black and under what circumstances" and had talked about it countless times before that morning.
"Remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers telling his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't help but take my daughter with me," Ferrell told me later.
"The events of today are... the culmination of events of the past.
My daughter has a right to know and grow into it.
He needs to be able to engage in activity and organization, but he also needs to know the different layers and circumstances of the experience of living black. And he needs to know what we have to do to free ourselves.
Luckily, though I have been able to protect him from flagrant racism, he is still like other black girls.
I feel like I would hurt him if I were to protect him from reality."
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, located across the street from the police station, which became a campground for activists waiting to hear about the case and finally learned that no charges would be brought against the police.
From there, Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to protestors.
Ferrell gradually began to react to activism in a new way.
"My activism changed completely after 9 August," he says. During his studies at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was chairman of the Association of Minor Nursing Students. At that time he focused on food law and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Somehow it just happened."
Weeks later, at the evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, assistant director of the documentary.
Folayan said that he and the photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "wanted simply to tell us" what was happening.
He said, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story that you can use?"
The reason for this suspicion was the countless times that people, usually whites, had appeared in the local community to benefit from its difficulties and perseverance.
"We had heard that those born and raised in Ferguson did not have a common voice," Folayan said in a recent interview. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted Deputy Director Damon Davis, who is known for his activism among prisoners sentenced to death.
Davis' involvement led Ferrell to join the project together with six other locals. The crew followed the events during the years following Brown's shooting.
"This is not a documentary where someone talks to us or speaks for us, but we talk," Davis says.
"For me, the most important thing was how local people are shown in the movie because I'm shown in the same way."
According to Mr Folayan, the aim was not to focus on the experience of Mrs Ferrell, who wanted to show that the people's movement was "not a charismatic leader but a community', but turned out to be the most open one to be described.
That is why the documentary shows surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and getting married.
"I felt pretty naked," Ferrell laughs when he tells me what it felt like to see a movie for the first time.
"But I realized that this work and the human description of black people require a certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats and brings to the centre the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was created in social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the police had shot a black teenage boy Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement identify with the queer identity.
"The leadership of black queer women has kept the movement going," says Ferrell. "It's because we have to fight on many fronts all the time.
Black queer women have had to deal with everything."
Folayan agrees: "Black women, including many queer women, are indeed in the business.'
However, he stresses that Ferrell was not selected for the document "self-purposely" due to his queer identity.
"He got the energy going," Folayan says.
"It is no coincidence, however, that he was on the front line. Black queer women live at the intersection of many things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is transmitted from the screen."
The news crews have left Ferguson long ago, but the relationship between the community and the police is still tense.
Ferrell has two and a half years left on probation, and he was convicted of blocking the freeway at the demonstration.
His description of the social political climate in his neighborhood is short and succinct: 'Mutter'.
Still, he still trusts the slogan he memorized on Ferguson's streets three years ago:
"Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We need to love each other and support each other.
All we can do is lose our chains."
A fitting resemblance: the artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman Gallery in New York has been hung in the middle of the showroom with faces - white, black and brown - and you can see a resemblance between them.
These 30 works are portraits by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on DNA samples from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where he served 35 years in prison, convicted of leaking classified diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
Dewey-Hagborg's A Becoming Resemblance exhibition was opened on 2.8.2017.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in his work. Manning is a transatlantic and pioneering dissident whose prison sentence was reduced by Barack Obama on the third day of his term of office.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning's DNA algorithmically and based on his genetic data created 30 portraits. They are a sharp, albeit slightly theoretical position on DNA data formatting, ambiguity and underlying causality and identity.
Chelsea Manning, born Bradley Edward, has openly identified herself with women since puberty. In 2013, she was found guilty of 20 crimes, including the violation of the Spy Act, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of the condemned Manning in prison: a grainy black-and-white selfie where the uncomfortable Manning sits in a car in the driver's seat with a platinum-blond wig on his head that became his signature.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had behind him a very popular Stranger Visions project, which he carried out in 2012.
In it he created portraits based on forensic data, obtained DNA data on, for example, cigarette butts and gums, and created images of what the people involved might have looked like.
Then the artist got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their case," Dewey-Hagborg told me at a new exhibition briefing.
Manning couldn't be visited or photographed in prison, so the paper contacted Chelsea and asked if he was interested in making a DNA portrait of Manning.
The artist and his imprisoned muse suddenly became correspondence buddies, writing each other for a couple of years.
They even wrote together a Suppressed Images comic book, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, describing the future in which the president would have relaxed Chelsea's sentence and would be able to watch the show.
In fact, Obama reduced Manning's sentence just a few days after the comic book was published, a lucky coincidence after seven hard years in a military prison in Kansas.
It is also impressive that the exhibition will be opened right now when Donald Trump is fighting his own war against data leaks and transgender soldiers and is discovering new ways on Twitter to strengthen the powerful divisions that he was actually supposed to alleviate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "everyone has a purpose."
On the wall of the gallery there is an artist's statement and underneath it is the great signature of Manning, where the heart of the last name i is the point. In its statement the artist insists on the end of "the automatic division on which sex, race, sexuality and culture are based."
On the opposite wall is Manning's DNA sequence: a long sequence of C, G and A letters written with pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters - or nucleotides, as is the scientific definition used by the artist - Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we all are, at least from our biology.
"I hope my exhibition will help people understand that we are equal from our genetic heritage and that genetic data is very personal and open to interpretation," says Dewey-Hagborg.
"DNA tells countless stories. 30 of them are on display here."
The final work of the exhibition is in its own room: page from Manning's comic book and Dewey-Hagborg's comic book.
There Manning's character rises from prison like King Kong, with a megaphone in his hand.
"If they can shut you up, they've won," it says.
"Don't ever shut up."
"The text is from a letter I received from Manning," says an artist from Philadelphia.
"It's so impressive that I still get chills."
Unlike the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning shows up, he is greeted with a face based on his own genetic data like a group of protestors in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is deliberate, like everything else in this exhibition: for example, Manning's DNA sequence is written with a pencil at a height similar to his height (157.5 cm).
"The faces were on the wall earlier, but I wanted to bring a crowd of people to them," says Dewey-Hagborg.
"I wanted to describe the mass movement that Chelsea created, which was also behind her release."
Professor of Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee are wanted for murder.
Police report that they have launched national searches to find a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who are suspected of stabbing a man to death in a Chicago luxury apartment.
The Cook County court records show that arrest warrants were issued on Monday from Wyndham Lathem, 42, and from Andrew Warren, 56, suspected of involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau. Arrest orders have been issued for first-degree murder without the possibility of bailing.
According to documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to a local bulletin published by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 27 July 2017.
The police in the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with multiple stab wounds in his body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene, and the stabbing was investigated as a murder, and the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as an assistant professor in microbiology and immunology at Nortwestern University since 2007.
In an e-mail statement by Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President responsible for social relations at the University, said that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from accessing Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal matter that the authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University is helping with the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
The statement sent by the university and the spokesman for Somerville College states that "we have been in contact with the police in Great Britain and are prepared to assist the authorities investigating the case in the United States in all possible ways."
The opinion also stated that Mr Warren's colleagues were shocked and hoped that he would surrender.
Anthony Guglielmi, Chief of Information at the Chicago Police Department, said that he was urging the suspects seriously to surrender to the authorities.
"Police have an idea of where they are, and we are constantly clarifying our search," said Guglielmi.
According to Guglielmi, local, regional and national authorities are assisting in the search for suspects.
He told me that the police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had received a vague tip that something had happened in the apartment 1008.
The police described the sight at the scene as terrifying.
Guglielmi says it's unclear whether the victim was murdered on the same day or earlier.
He told me the security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim were having an affair," says Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza management team issued the following statement to the residents: "The police are currently investigating the course of events and the background of the victim and possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
He threatened to blow up an Islamic bookstore and "kill Muslims" in London.
"I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic," the doomed said to the police.
Moffatt must perform 100 hours of unpaid community service.
A 39-year-old man was convicted of his threats to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and "kill all Muslims."
According to the Independent magazine, David Moffatt was convicted, among other things, of aggravated harassment.
According to the police, the bookstore staff alerted them on May 23rd.
According to the staff, the man "had threatened to blow up the bookstore and kill the Muslims."
The suspect left the store after threats.
They caught Moffatt when he called the police for threats.
The threat had nothing to do with what happened at the bookstore.
Authorities found that Moffatt was dressed in the same costume as the suspect in the bookstore events, a police spokesman said.
I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm a Catholic, Moffatt told the cops at interrogation.
As a punishment, a man must perform 100 hours of unpaid social services and pay £620, i.e. approximately €690, and £85, i.e. approximately €95 for victims.
According to Scotland Yard's spokesman, a number of hate crimes are not reported.
"We will complete the WADA road map in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the activities of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) road map to restore the Russian Anti-Doping Commission (RUSADA) powers.
"Some of the road map measures have already been implemented and RUSADA was given the right to design and test in cooperation with UKAD of the UK Anti-Doping Commission.
The WADA road map has been updated in this respect," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map, which sets out the conditions for restoring the powers of RUSADA. The second part of the road map was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to the bend, it does not contain anything that is worrying for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, and everything will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future," Mutko added.
One of the points on the road map, however, requires the Russian anti-doping authorities to publicly accept the findings of the WADA-appointed Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren's investigation. McLaren is investigating the alleged state involvement in Russian sport doping.
To that Mutko said: "The investigation is ongoing because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no state programmes and we cannot admit what did not exist."
Mutko's words echoed the statement made by Vitaly Smirnov, president of the independent Russian public anti-doping committee.
Smirnov, who spoke earlier that same day to Russian RSport sports media, admitted that there have been problems in Russian anti-doping bodies. "We have said several times that there are controversial positions and regulations in the report.
We are not going to accept the report unconditionally," he added.
The WADA ordered RUSADA to cease its anti-doping surveillance in Russia in November 2015, after the scope of the doping scandal had been revealed.
However, last June it was authorised to design and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
In July, Olivier Niggli, Director of WADA, visited the head office of RUSADA in Moscow. After the visit, he noted that the organisation was on the "right track" towards the restoration of powers.
British organisation skeptical of the innovation that is dear to Finns: "there is no evidence of the health benefits of maternity packaging"
The British organisation doubts the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packages.
Among other things, the BBC and Guardian report that Lullaby Trust, who fights infant deaths, prohibits the use of its own brochures in maternity packages distributed in Britain.
The distribution of maternity kits to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England too, packaging is distributed in some areas.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that a maternity pack reduces the risk of infant death.
Civic death means the baby's unexplained sudden death.
Lullaby Trust is an expert in British health authorities in the safe sleep of a child.
We will no longer allow our official brochures to be packed into them because it would suggest that we recommend this product, the organization informed.
Finland has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world, only two per thousand dead births.
According to Lullaby Trust, Finland's good reading is the result of many different reasons, such as the low rate of teenage pregnancy.
Giving each family a box may be one factor.
However, it cannot be said for certain, Francine Bates, CEO of the Lullaby Trust, said.
We are concerned that maternity packages will be marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and infant deaths.
The maternity pack is a Finnish invention and has been given free of charge to all mothers in Finland for 80 years.
The package contains a variety of items such as children's clothing.
This year there are 53 products in the package.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box where the child can be put to bed.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes it distributes meet all safety standards.
Lullaby Trust, on the other hand, says that there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes as a sleeping place.
According to Lullaby Trust, packaging may be the best option for sleeping if there is no crib or cot available.
The organisation recommends using the package for nap only and to stop using it when the child is able to turn around.
The organization also recommends keeping pets out of the package and ensuring that it does not get wet or dirty.
A quick villain ran away from a Japanese zoo for the second time.
The staff at the Japanese Zoo are looking for a runaway turtle.
The giant tortoise has surprised the staff at its speed and has run away for the second time in two weeks.
The turtle escaped from Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, western Japan, on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the villain left the zoo through the main entrance.
It does not die instantly because it eats grass around the zoo, but we are very concerned, Yoshimi Yamane, who works at the zoo, told us.
The escaped 35-year-old villain is female, 55 kg and about one meter tall.
Yamane describes a fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During the opening hours, the villain is allowed to travel freely in the garden area.
The zoo hasn't received any eyewitness reports from the turtle.
The villain's last runaway trip happened the other week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking down the road 150 meters from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane told me.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups will help your attempt to avoid Uber's mistakes
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction in her online startup business, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even misleading.
Although he assured us that the surveys were anonymous, some workers were suspicious of them.
"The questions were simply not consistent and objective," says Errett. As his hair care company Madison Reed focuses on online shopping. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to resort to outside help.
More and more new types of HR start-ups have entered the market, helping other companies to find out how their employees are doing.
They develop and license software that can measure employee commitment; companies can conduct surveys and target specific teams and groups of people, offer anonymous reporting services to their employees, and in some cases direct contact with the board of directors.
"Our health can be monitored by applications such as Strava and Fitbit, but where is the company Fitbit?" asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of the Glint startup in Redwood City.
Errett has been using Glint's software for three years and says he has gained an even deeper insight into the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
The programme can make rapid inquiries and votes for certain teams, and it can draw up a map of which you can see at one glance which departments the workers are most dissatisfied with and which of the leaders have received the weakest estimates, which may have allowed Errett to drill into the root of the problems.
Companies have understood that they must follow the culture of the workplace so that they do not become the next Uber. Since the former employee wrote in his blog about a culture where workers are harassed and people who talk about problems are punished.
For startups like Glint, such neglect is an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance are a global industry whose value, according to the Let's Talk Payments website, can reach over USD 118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent in Denver, Colorado, is a startup that helps companies to detect and prevent inappropriate behaviour. Interest in the company grew earlier this year when Uber's reputation suffered a crash.
Converten has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently entered into an agreement with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to conduct customized surveys, collect answers in confidence in real time and identify problem areas.
In addition, employees can report inappropriate behaviour anonymously by SMS.
And if there's any reason to suspect that the manager is inappropriate, the complaints go directly to the company's board of directors.
"General opinion has replaced the authorities," says Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
He points out that if a company treats its employees badly or acts unethically, the consequences can be costly even if the authorities do not intervene; consumers can start boycotting the company and it can also lose employees and be sued.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has over 25 000 employees in 500 locations. The company has been using Convercent for over a year because it wants to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and can easily connect with the head office.
Previously, the practice was that if an employee wanted to report the problem, he had to first find out the telephone number or e-mail address with which he could report to the head office. Then he had to make an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
"It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience," says James Vitrano, Legal Director of Ruby Tuesday. According to him, it was difficult to follow the complaints made by employees.
In the past, problems remained hidden from leaders working in another city or state; problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can now be detected and dealt with more quickly.
"I get a more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the worker's reality," says Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"At the same time, we protect our shareholders from industrial litigation."
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously after Arthur Andersen's collapse as a result of unethical activity in the Enron scandal.
It was only through social media that companies realized that they could no longer prevent the public clearing of their dirty laundry.
"The hope was used as a strategy before technology came under ethical control," says Quinlan.
Glint and Converten offer their software as a service that is regularly charged for its use.
It is a business model and opportunity approved by venture capital investors. Both Glint and Convercent have support for venture capital investors.
In February, Converten raised $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which has raised a total of $47 million in capital.
In November, Glint received EUR 10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners and has raised a total of USD 60 million.
Investment is no surprise given the links between companies, business culture and venture capital.
Several studies show that employees expect more from their workplaces than before.
In a competitive market such as Silicon Valley, good wages, and interesting projects are only the beginning.
Workers want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they are giving their time to a genuinely useful company.
"Employers are more committed to the success of the company if they are comfortable in the company and feel listened to and rewarded by their work," says Nina McQueen, Director of LinkedIn Corporation, who is responsible for the remuneration and welfare of employees.
Investors get profits when companies succeed, and companies succeed when employees commit.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it is no wonder that they are of interest to investors.
According to the experts in the workplace culture, awareness of the commitment of workers is important,
but it is useless if no action is taken on this basis.
If a company requests feedback from its employees, it can be considered as a sign of change.
And if change doesn't change quickly enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce workers' commitment.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be prepared to have four thousand discussions," says Russell Raath, CEO of the management consultant Kotter International, who has seen companies rely too much on mere data collection.
"If the company does not take action, employees will start to wonder if they were heard
and whether their opinions matter at all.
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed is currently conducting personnel surveys on a monthly basis and is able to tackle the problem on the same day as reported in Glint.
After he had collected feedback on the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communication from frustrated workers, Errett was able to make changes to teams and organise communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help them to improve their long-term sustainability in a sector known for their high turnover.
"If the company does not commit itself to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose its employees," Vitrano says.
"If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers there are no companies."
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of camouflage his naked neighbor, reports the news agency TT.
A woman in Gothenburg had come out of the shower at home when she noticed her window hanging on a cell phone at the end of a rope.
According to the woman, the cell phone camera shot into the apartment.
The woman who was frightened by the incident had run into another room to dress.
After the woman had arrived to check on the situation, her cell phone had been pulled up first, but soon thereafter put back into the window.
A 20-year-old man who was suspected of confiscating has admitted to filming a woman.
But he claimed to have only filmed the woman's face.
The video on the cell phone had been deleted and the police had failed to return it as evidence.
In interrogations, the man has admitted the act, but he has denied that he has committed a crime.
The man he described was justified by saying that he loves his neighbor "very crazy."
According to the news agency, the man is being charged with the case.
Teachers demand more money in autumn negotiations
Wage development cannot be lower than in the export industry, for example, but should narrow the gap," said Olli Luukkainen, President of OAJ on Thursday.
The temporary cut in public sector holiday money highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to conclude agreements which in some way do not involve the cuts in holiday money.
In the local government sector, contracts are expected only after the private sector papers have been signed and the increase percentages are clear.
Luukkainen predicts that the employment conditions of OAJ, for example, have been agreed in January.
Luukkainen has not yet revealed the percentage targets.
Luukkainen is also chairman of the public-educated negotiating organisation Jukko.
Luukkainen: Holiday allowance surgery increases earnings differences
According to OAJ, statistics and forecasts indicate that the purchasing power of public sector wage earners is deteriorating while private sector purchasing power is growing.
According to Luukkainen, temporary vacation allowance cuts will further exacerbate the differences in earnings development.
In Finland, it is necessary to determine how many pupils per teacher can be:
OAJ also points out that equality in basic education must be ensured, as differences between those who do the best and those who do the weakest are increasing all the time.
According to the organisation, learning outcomes are deteriorating and differences between pupils and regions are constantly increasing.
Bruins' day extended as the NCAA reduced daily exercises from two to one
It's almost eleven o'clock in the evening, and a bunch of UCLA American football players have stayed and talked to the other side of the campus' new training fields.
Some of them have taken off their jerseys, and their backs are shiny with sweat since the first day of the training camp.
For quite a few of them, this few minutes of chat is a noon break.
After three hours of rehearsal, the players attending the university's summer courses return to the dorm to study for finals. The next morning they meet at 6:30 in the Wasserman football center.
"The next three days will be tough for these guys," Bruins coach Jim Mora says shortly before Monday's change on Tuesday.
The university sports umbrella reduced the number of daily training sessions from two to one, with the aim of reducing the workload of players, but it has extended their days - at least until Friday, when the final exams will be held.
That's why UCLA's first three rehearsals started at about 15 minutes past seven in the evening. Players' already full schedules were difficult to find space.
Limiting the training sessions to one per day means that there are more training days than before. The camp started almost a week earlier this year than last year, and this is the first time during Mora's six-season Westwood coach season when the exercises are held at the same time as summer courses.
Exercises are scheduled to take place 18 times before August 20, when the actual preparation for the opening match of the season begins: UCLA meets Texas A&M in September.
Mora says that he supported the NCAA's change of rules, even though it made the players' schedules even stricter.
"We load them very much for three or four days, and that is very challenging," says Mora.
"But the players are ready to work. They're great friends.
I think it's gonna get easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA closes the exercises from outside after the camp. This is not easy given the direct view from the training fields to the adjacent parking lot and Luskin Center, a high-quality hotel that has already been bombed with football footballs flying over the wall of the paint pole.
Bruins players are expected to move to the hotel this weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the season when the rooms are available to outsiders.
"We have security arrangements," Mora says.
"The concern is that people can book a room and film exercises there on video. It is not an exaggerated concern.
There's gonna be quite a lot of money coming out of a video shot of rehearsals.
But we have guards there and in the parking lot.
We're doing the best we can.
I'm not gonna overdo it.
We have a plan."
Freedom to Rwanda
On Friday, presidential elections will take place in Central African Rwanda, the winner of which is already considered to be clear.
Paul Kagame is officially seeking his third term, but in practice he has contributed to the country's leadership since 1994.
At that time, the rebel group RPF ended the genocide organized by extremist hoods.
Kagame was commander of the RPF.
Kagame has been criticised, among other things, for crushing the opposition and restricting the freedom of the word.
He has also been accused of, for example, distorting poverty statistics.
For the third period, Kagame will be able to make an effort because the Constitution, which was limited to two periods of presidential office, was changed.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a genuinely well-preserved leader.
In his time, there have been social reforms in Rwanda and international investments have flowed into the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in uniting a country divided by genocide.
The success of Rwanda has led many Africans to ask whether liberal multiparty democracy is the right model for African states.
However, Kagame too has promised his people more freedom after the earth has been lifted on its feet.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook fights fake news by intensifying the verification of facts
Facebook plans to send potential fake news more and more to independent fact inspectors and present the results under the original article. The world's largest social network announced it on Thursday.
The company published a statement on its website stating that it will start using updated machine learning to identify fake news. Possible fake news will be sent to fact inspectors and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the biggest distributors of fake news and many believe that fake news contributed to the results of the US presidential election in 2016.
The issue has arisen in a political debate in Europe where French voters were bombed with fake news before the presidential elections in May and Germany, which is preparing for the September elections, supports the plan to fine social media networks if they do not quickly remove hostile content.
On Thursday Facebook announced in a separate opinion published in Germany that the verification of facts is being tried in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"People want to see which stories do not pass through the screen of independent inspectors. They also want more background information so that they can decide more enlightenedly what they read and share," said Sara Su, Product Manager for Facebook News Feed, wrote on the company's blog.
He added that Facebook continues to test related articles and makes other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
Birth of a comic book: Story of a castle
A small Castle of Scotney in the county of Kent is now known as Squeeze's music video and Margaret Thatcher's hideout from the 1970s and 1980s.
Now this charming castle in the Bewl River Valley is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired writer who is fond of old documents.
"I think it's great to be able to study a text written by a person who died over 300 years ago," Rhodes says with longing.
"I feel a personal connection when I hold the letter in my hand."
Rhodes' book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotland from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era. Each story is illustrated by a different artist, a promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first archive-based book. In 2014, Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories appeared to him, whose inspiration was inspired by British National Library documents.
"I moved into tears when I noticed a thumbprint in the letter, written by a double agent working for Jacobites in the 18th century," Rhodes says.
"It was his fingerprints!
And the letters smell like smoke because fire was used as lighting at the time.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel that he is on the spot.
I love archives!"
A writer who was attracted to old documents was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Art Council of England, which seemed too good to be true. He admits that he could not be in the castle without delay for a little longer than would have been hoped.
He spent the days studying the Victorian "new" castle, archives, treasures and rareties, such as hyena heads hung on walls and bottles for centuries in a moat.
He toured the ruins and estates of the old castle and talked with the rangers, gardeners, and sometimes also the fictional artists.
In the evenings, he "takes whiskey and starts writing."
The closer history of Scotney is rather unknown, since the castle was transferred entirely to the National Trust Foundation only after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived about ten years later, the Foundation staff was just starting to go through the archive. Rhodes describes that the archives had been held hundreds of years in the same method: by taking everything extra to the attic.
There were diaries in the archives, letters from the times of the British Empire and maps of who owned what. "You can imagine that the land disputes are boring," Rhodes says. "Families fought here, however, even for one birch.
I thought maybe we should just let it go."
Some of the stories in the book go from castle to English history, such as The Labourer. It tells of a man who joins Britain's peasant rebellion shortly after the castle was completed in 1381.
"The Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex mentions that there was a riot in the castle in 1380," Rhodes says.
"England's peasant rebellion began in the same area, and it occurred to me that the rebellion could start in a riot.
Maybe these events are connected?"
The other stories in the book are closely linked to the history of the castle - such as The Priest, the priest that the Darrell family hid for seven years during the Reformation of England.
The Smuggler, on the other hand, tells the story of smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century. He is said to have staged his own funeral with stones filled with coffin (it was discovered years later when his grave was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotney. "The family's men seem to have been quite a bunch of scoundrels. They were constantly in debt and bought things they couldn't afford.
The men of the Darrell family solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women, and I see them as handsome guys who knew how to court the heiress."
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book on the Life Museum, a sanatorium in the early 20th century where only a eutrophic plot is left.
There's a special place in Scotney's castle in his heart.
"It was sad to leave," he says.
"I didn't want to go back to this goddamn everyday life yet."
The worst relationship with Russia since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has deteriorated clearly, commented NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think it can be said that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War," Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
However, especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continuing instability caused by Russia in the Eastern Ukraine region, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to doing so so so that tensions do not peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid any escalation and another cold war.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, U.S. President Donald Trump found that the relationship between the United States and Russia has even reached a dangerously bad level.
Mr Trump called for the poor relations between the countries to be congratulated by the Congress which approved the new sanctions against Russia last week.
Vladimir Klitchko quits - a rematch against Anthony Joshua will not come true
The long-term heavyweight champion of professional boxing, Vladimir Klitchko, ends his career.
Ukrainian Klitchko, 41, announced its decision on Thursday morning.
Klitshko, who struck gold at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, fought as a professional 69 times, winning 64 matches.
He held various World Championship titles in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost the last two games of his career.
Tyson Fury hit him with points in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitshko faced Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost after a wild fight in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitchko were expected to face a rematch in Las Vegas in November.
However, Klitchko found no motivation for the match.
I deliberately spent a few weeks making a decision to get enough distance from the Wembley match," Klitshko reported in his release.
As an amateur and professional boxer, I achieved everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I could never have imagined having such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
See Klitchko's reasons for its decision on the video.
Klitshko's manager, Bernd Bönte, reported in a press release that the decision to terminate was difficult for Klitshko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why this is definitely the right decision, Mr Bonte said.
Klitshko has been dating US actor Hayden Panettiere since 2009.
The couple has one child, Kaya, a daughter born in 2014.
Klitshko's older brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight champion of the world.
During 2008-12, the brothers ruled the World Championship titles of different unions at the same time.
The weatherbreaker in Finland is witching under conditions: "Take out the vibe"
Pike jumper Minna Nikkanen has suffered from the conditions during the summer's outdoor iron season.
Minna Nikkanen has had some problems with the circumstances.
The wind and the cold have taken a woman's vibe.
Even the World Cup in London has unstable circumstances.
Minna Nikkanen is talking about the weather.
The circumstances have been this summer against the pole jumper Minna Nikka.
I don't want to blame the track, but it was incomprehensible that I couldn't even get the little pole to move properly," Nikkanen said after Innsbruck's race.
I've been competing and practicing here for God knows how many times and I've never experienced such fluctuating winds in this place," Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmin in Games.
This season it has been very difficult to standardise the jump, even with such unstable winds in the exercises," Nikkanen said in Kaleva's competitions.
The weather was in London on Thursday, too.
It's been quite a challenge to get the technology together - whether it's cold-jamed or whatever.
It's been cold and windy, and it's made me feel better.
There's no point in consuming energy in a bad environment.
He got into the World Championship because of his 455 jump.
It's been 445 outside.
The circumstances in London are not the same for everyone.
You have to be patient and wait for better winds.
The goal is to exceed 460 on Friday's qualifying.
Why don't you move out to practice abroad?
That won't be necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany from the beginning.
I got the jump together and the tech standardized.
I guess I should have done the same thing now.
Normally, you've been rehearsing in the hangar. Now the hall's been closed.
How would it be ideal to race?
It's 25 degrees warm.
A little wind will do as long as it's constant.
An experienced ex-connoisseur ruffled the politicians in general: "We have no room for division now and for many years"
Despite the positive climate of the economy, Juha Sipilä's government must keep the ice in the hat and be careful to increase the government budget with debt money, warns Erkki Virtanen, who has prepared budgets for decades at the Ministry of Finance.
He says there's no room for division.
Yle interviewed a retired Virta in 2015 on Wednesday's first morning.
The state budget for next year is just beginning.
Recently, the proposals made by politicians, such as raising the guarantee pension, lowering the car tax and supporting electric bicycles, are seen by Virtanen as election talks.
They mainly tell us that the elections are getting close because, when 10% of the state budget is financed by additional debt, we have no room for division now and for many years.
I even think it's a fraud to talk about a split thief when you take out a debt," Virtanen said to Yle.
Mr Virtanen stressed that all debts owed to children were due.
Virtanen has long experience in preparing state budgets: in 1978 he began as budget secretary at the Ministry of Finance and then worked as Deputy Head of Budget and Head of Budget.
The last time he retired, he served as Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Employment and the Economy.
In an interview with Yle, Virtanen pointed out that the 3% growth forecast now is likely to be temporary.
All fortune tellers estimate that this is a thorn from which we are starting to go downhill next year, and Finland is expecting a one per cent increase for decades.
Washington amends the rules on permanent residence permits
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that the rules of the permanent residence permit, Green Card, will be amended by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and limit family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money by changing the way in which permanent residence permits are granted to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain migration and replaces the current programme.
The new application process will benefit applicants who are English-speaking and able to support themselves and who have the skills to benefit our economy," Trump said, according to the media.
The wife of the Queen of Denmark does not want to be buried with the Queen in the same place.
Prince Henry doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
The picture shows Prince Henry and Queen Margaret photographed in April.
Queen of Denmark Margareta, 77, and her spouse Prince Henry, 83, is not to be buried side by side, says the Danish court.
Traditionally, the couples of rulers in Denmark are buried in the same place.
The King's House has announced today that Prince Henry does not want to be buried in the Roskilde Cathedral, says the court in its announcement on Thursday.
According to BT, the reason for this is the prince's dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It is no secret that the prince has been unhappy with his role and title in the Danish monarchy, Lene Belleby, head of communication at the court, commented in the paper.
For the prince, the decision not to bury him alongside the queen is a natural consequence of not being treated on an equal footing with his mate.
According to the court, the queen has long been aware of the desire for her mate's burial place and understands the decision.
Horror on the road: The car almost hit the freeway
Tom had a common-law partner and two small children on board.
They were not injured in the accident but do not receive the money from the insurance if the other party is not reached.
The crash occurred at Keimolanport in Vantaa.
Archive photo from the construction site of Ring III.
Tommi from Vantaa says his family survived a car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, his cohabiting partner Riina and the couple's two small children drove on the highway at Keimolanport in Vantaa towards Hämeenlinna.
From the connection of Ring III to Hämeenlinna fairway, a white car drove along the acceleration lane, which was to run on the side of the family car," Tommi says.
If it hadn't been for evasive action, Tom would've gotten the car on top of him.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it got out of hand," Tom says.
The family car hit the railing fast.
Parents and two small children in the back seat were not injured.
One child is slightly less than 3 years old, the other less than 1 year old.
Apparently, it was pretty good luck when nothing happened to us.
No one passing even hit us, even though there was a lot of traffic in the place.
The accident occurred about 5:20 p.m.
According to Tom, no one stopped at their place, and the family called 911.
They got out of the car on their own.
The paramedics and the rescue team showed up, and the family was checked out.
The car ran out of cash.
Tom tells us that he and his common-law partner have a small income, and they received family allowance for buying a car a couple of years ago.
Without the information from the other car, Tom says the family can't get the money from the insurance.
That's why the family wants eyewitnesses to see the car, which is why the family drove into the railing.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take kids to the nursery and work without it," Tom says.
Tom saw that the car was a white, older car.
It was probably from the late 1990s or early 2000s.
He thought the license plate number of the car was SIG.
If we don't catch the culprit, I don't know how we're gonna do financially, we're gonna have to count every cent today.
Tom hopes that anyone who has seen or knows anything about what happened will be in contact with the police.
The Eastern Uusimaa Police Department and the Central Uusimaa Rescue Department confirm that they had a mission on Tuesday night at the scene of the accident.
The title and story were corrected at 9.15 p.m.: Contrary to what was originally told in the case, Tom said the other car did not come across the band of those who came, but was to drive from the acceleration lane to the side of the family car.
The performance directed by Lotta Jäppinen deals with relationships through humor - Self-detector will be seen at What?-theater on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen from Kouvola brings her first-born guidance to What? Theatre.
The self-expressor is a musical theater performance on past relationships and inadequacies.
According to director Lotta Jäppinen, it still makes you feel good.
The subject is dealt with by humor.
You don't just sit around feeling bad, he says.
According to Jäppinen, the touring summer theatre performance has been carried out with a tiny budget and a large, young heart.
The title of the performance challenges you to consider what a person reveals about himself when he becomes acquainted with a new person.
Is he perhaps pulling a role or is he approaching another jacket?
Intriguing performance confuses fact and fiction
Jumpy has both directed and dramatized the performance.
He's also in charge of the lights.
The proposal consists of the working group's texts and does not contain a plot.
The director believes that while the performance draws young people's thoughts, it speaks to people of all ages.
Jappinen emphasizes that the Self Revealer does not tell directly about his own or the group's relationships.
Fact and fiction mix.
I'm sure my own world of values will come from the show.
I do not think that relationships would be bad, but I also do not think that relationships, especially relationships, are a prerequisite for happiness.
Many Learn From Divorced Parents
Jäppinen believes that the self-reliant draws an up-to-date picture of young adults living in 100 years of age in Finland.
According to him, many have learned much about relationships with their parents, many of whom have divorced.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka will play.
Ella Snellman is also part of the team.
The music atonement is Jappinen and Roka's.
Love for the theater caught fire in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvola, studies the theatre expression at the Turku University of Applied Sciences Academy of Fine Arts.
There's two years in the back and another one in the front.
Jap's enthusiasm for the theater has begun during the years of Kouvola.
The breeder of music classes has been an assistant at Kouvola Theatre and has played at the Student Theatre in Helsinki and most recently at Linnatheater in Turku.
The steering has become more and more interesting.
Last week, a self-explosionist got his premiere in Helsinki on the stage of Fool.
A performance lasting about 45 minutes has also been seen in the future, at least in the study town of Jäppinen in Turku.
Self-expressor Kouvolan What?-theater at 4.8. at 7:00 and 5.8. at 2:00 and 19:00.
A Finnish Olympic winner recovered for a year from a terrible motocrosson accident - a broken neck.
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable natural power as Janne Lahtala.
The Ace of Kumpare counting traveled the world for hundreds of days a year for 20 years and chased her dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but Lahtela's movement continued.
He was not only a tireless intern, but also a tester of new species.
There are probably not many forms of exercise on earth that a Kemijärvian would not have tried at least once.
It's been inspiring to practice.
There's always something new," Lahtela says.
Finally, one hobby was to stop Lahtala altogether.
In 2014, Lahtela had a motocross accident.
As a result, his neck and both hands were broken.
I didn't work anywhere.
I licked wounds in my house for a year," Lahtela says.
Lahtela had bad luck.
He also admits that age may have played its part in the accident.
Driving a bike can sound wild.
But I didn't get any boundaries with it.
It's just a species so hard that you don't want to spend too much time in your 40s!
After the accident, Lahtala came into a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
Behind us was a long runner as head coach of the Japanese freestyle team.
Lahtela started in the post immediately after her career ended in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15 years old, I had to be in my seat.
I didn't really do much," Lahtela says.
Even during his training, Lahtala often challenged her protégé in the slope and in the physics tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was so tired physically and mentally that even my own thoughts did not make sense.
Not even with the species.
It was good to be there.
I actually enjoyed it because I actually got to be for once.
The mandatory break inspired Lahtala to be the head coach of Finland.
Without stopping, he's afraid he's burned out.
It is easier to find places in the body that have broken down than are intact!
If it wasn't for the accident, I wouldn't have realized I needed that much rest.
Lahtela started coaching Finland's freestyle team about a year ago.
About the same time, he found a safer hobby to replace speed sports.
I traded motocrosses for frisbee golf!
It got out of hand right away.
At worst, I spent seven hours a day throwing.
Although Lahtela has always been a super enthusiastic trainer, she does not demand that her coaches be the same as hers.
I'm not forcing everyone into the same mold.
Our culture has space to be its own kind and ways to become the best of the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and the mentality has always been in line with it," Lahtela says.
Sex robots are coming, and we should be worried.
It's here: a report on the development of technology in the sex robot industry - just as it had begun to feel that 2017 can't get any weirder.
Oh, yeah.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
"We need to start taking the spread of sex robots seriously," says founder member of the Foundation and emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence from the University of Noel Sharkey Sheffield.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingernails.
"Sex robots are being skimmed, but they are already being sold quite a lot, and we will see more of them," Sharkey said at the release of the report.
Sex puppets have evolved from blown dolls to robots that have a warm-blooded silicone skin and artificial intelligence-created features that resemble human behavior.
The user can also adapt the robot to his own preferences from the color of the eyes to the shape of the nipples and the type and color of the fingernails.
What is all the more worrying is that robots have a "personality" that makes Stepford's women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user's preferences, perhaps shy.
The Roxxy Gold robots of True Companion have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous and so on.
"Roxxy Gold's personality adapts as perfectly as possible to the user's personality," the company's website is advertised.
In other words, a robot likes the same things as a user.
It also has different moods:
It may be tired, chat or "the mood."
There are many worrying aspects to the generalisation of sex robots: they replace genuine relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and direct rape fantasies when the user approaches, for example, a shy and resistant programmed robot.
True Companion compares Roxxy robot to vibrator:
"Why shouldn't men have sex robots?"
But sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their generalisation and development is about something darker and deeper in our culture: the decline in gender equality towards sexual intercourse, where subjugation is one of the options among others.
Of course, most men do not get sex robots, and their popularity is still marginal, although the FRR report reported their growing popularity.
Marginal phenomena, however, tell us much about the spirit of time.
And a lot of people don't start acting weird or insulting until the market gives them permission.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have begun to become more common at a time when women's rights are threatened around the world and there is a president in the White House who has bragged about harassing women.
In the television series The Handmaid's Tale is not the most worrying imagery in its powerful language, such as images of hanging bodies and digging out of the eyes. The most disturbing thing is how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
Efforts are being made to make sex robots as much like real women (in terms of porn stars) as technically possible.
Robots developers want their skin to feel real and movements to imitate human movements as well as possible.
However, their "personalities" are far from reality.
The robot can't leave the relationship or the situation.
They do not have their own will or history - nothing indicative of independence or a violation of the fantasy of total submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Slaves.
Police suspect: Two terrorist acts were planned in Australia, led by ISIS Chief
The head of the extremist organization Isis led a group of Australian men who were suspected of planning to take the bomb into the aircraft of Etihad Airways.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, Isis's leading figure had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
Suspectedly, the bomb was supposed to be taken to the aircraft on July 15, but the company was suspended before the security check.
The police won't give us any more details as to why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a toxic, colourless gas discharge device and take it to a crowded public place, such as a public transport vehicle.
Michael Phelan, Australia's Federal Assistant Commissioner, says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
As a result of suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations will continue.
The good things about Trump?
Make Mitt Romney look like the perfect image of common sense.
During Trump's term, it has already been repeated to the point of boredom that families have also been broken up by a strong division of voters at daily level.
About Christmas and Thanksgiving, U.S.A. newspaper advisory columns taught us how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
They want us all to pierce our information bubble.
Less attention has been paid to Trump's ability to unite families.
I'm telling you this because my cousin was visiting me this week in New York, a left-wing poet living in Chicago, who has long been the buttons against the Republicans of our family.
He reminded us that a common enemy can have a powerful uniting effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all my cousins are acquainted - including a Republican sibling with whom he has been arguing over politics for decades - are suddenly and suddenly on the same side.
At the dinner table it is a good thing, but, more generally, there are significant risks involved.
Trump has given the left a new flow, but the distorting effect of his presidency can actually lead us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization," we talk about the frightening possibility that one day we will no longer be able to terrify his stunts.
In the long term, there is an even more appalling possibility that Trump will normalize the Republicans on the right extreme, which suddenly seem reasonable compared to Trump.
I'm sad to recall Mitt Romney's restrained version of madness: a dog on the roof of a car, 14% income tax (and we've seen his tax return).
When Trump's season is over, the next Republican presidential candidate will only have to be lucid, and it will immediately seem to be a remarkable improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our kids to Central Park Carousel, the biggest carousel in the New York Park Department and the best you can get for three dollars in New York without caffeine.
The horses of the carousel are huge, the figures in the center - the grotesque clowns and the terrified animals behind them - are ominous, and the music in the background is strangely fascinating.
Many of New York's hallmarks become disillusioned over time: the view of tall buildings is getting bored, the city's silhouette becomes too familiar and the city's reality does not match dreams.
And still, after 35 years, I haven't gotten over the fact that Swiss Cottage isn't a Swiss cottage, it's a big roundabout in northern London.
On the other hand, the Central Park Carousel is still a strangely magical experience - to the extent that two two two - year - olds, one eleven - year - old, and two forty - year - old women enjoy it immensely.
I would have given the merry-go-round a full score if someone had asked for my assessment, but I'm glad no one came to ask questions.
Instead, I was asked this week at the department store to evaluate my "payment experience" on a scale of one to five stars before I put my credit card on the reader.
The same thing happens in a café in my neighborhood, but there I am also given the opportunity to combine 15% of the service money when I myself go to the coffee counter.
This slows down everyday interaction and puts pressure on the customer servant to put his personality in a situation where it is not needed.
The saleswoman at the department store smiled as regrettable as I gave my credit card experience five stars tiredly.
Shefki Kuqi was fired from Inter - "There was no management trust"
FC Inter has today released Shefki Kuq's representative team coach.
The coaching responsibility is assumed by Fabrizio Piccare, a former assistant coach.
The rest of the training team will continue in their present assignments.
Piccareta, an Italian, has previously served as an assistant coach in English Sunderland, for example.
In January, the 51-year-old Piccareta, who joined the Inter Training Team, completed the UEFA Pro license last year.
Stefan Håkans, Chairman of the board of FC Inter, is sorry about what happened.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the trust of the club's management, so that there was no alternative now, Håkans commented in the club's press release.
Piccareta's contract is valid until the end of the season.
Together with the other coaching team, he will be responsible for tomorrow's home match against IFK.
According to Night-Says, the team's been up and running all Thursday.
On Thursday morning, Kuqi told the players that the club's assistant coaches Piccareta and John Allen have been moved away.
Kuqi and Piccareta had a strong match with PS Kem last Saturday in the Inter game.
Linda Lampenius published a youth photo from the '80s. Would you recognize a serious violin student?
On Instagram, violin artist Linda Lampenius published a youth photo.
Several assages have been added to the picture to suggest that the musician is a 16-year-old student of the Sibelius Academy.
Lampenius himself wonders seriously about a young woman looking at the camera.
A long time ago, serious, he communicates.
If you don't see the picture, you can watch it right here.
In the past, Lampenius has published pictures of his past and has also spoken of painful subjects.
About a year ago, on Instagram, he published a pair of pictures of himself.
One picture shows her 20 years ago, the other she poses now, mother of two children.
In his caption, Lampenius ponders his own human growth and refers to eating disorders that he suffered from when he was younger.
20 years ago and today...
I still look a lot like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I've learned to like myself and how I look, Lampenius wrote.
After the text he had added in English hashtags life, eating disorder, insecure, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating disorders in previous years.
She was already 14 years old in the hospital because of anorexia and ortorexia.
A little later, he also became ill with bulimia, which eventually became apparent only in 2006.
Healing began gradually.
In addition to therapy and peer review, Lampenius was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was delivered from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time that Pistorius was taken from prison to the hospital.
Last year he was hospitalized for cuts on his wrists, which, according to prison officials, he fell in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder on the defendants' complaint of the original manslaughter sentence.
He killed Steenkamp during the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by firing several shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he thought his girlfriend was a night intruder hiding in the bathroom.
The prosecutors have reported their intention to appeal again because they consider the six - year sentence of Pistorius to be too mild.
The State Prosecutor intends to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal will possibly be dealt with as early as this year.
If the appeal is accepted, the sentence of Pistorius may be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in place in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two illegally camped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, reported by the State Department according to the bTV channel.
Police arrested a bunch of unauthorized camped people in Sithonia on the morning of August 1st, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
According to the television channel bTV, the State Department later announced that they had released the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened up the rules on free campsites and already impose substantial fines on anyone camping in areas other than those reserved for purpose.
The audits shall continue until the end of the period.
The Ministry announced that the court might impose a fine.
The liquid stock is sinking - already sunk -7.7%
Oil refiner Neste's share has sunk by 7.7 per cent around 11:00.
Its pre-tax profit fell but exceeded the forecast compiled by Inquire Financial.
The stock exchange has started today with a slight frost in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
Shortly after the opening of the stock markets, the large European Stox 600 index had fallen by 0.2%.
After about half an hour of trading, the Helsinki stock exchange general index OMXH had fallen by 0.3 per cent to 9509.48 points and the most traded companies OMXH25 had fallen by 0.3 per cent.
The total exchange was EUR 41 million, of which nine million was the morning's performance publisher Neste.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve irritated bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like nightmares in the digestive system.
However, a recent study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in meat protein and dairy products may facilitate irritated bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 people in the United Kingdom. It causes stomach cramps, swelling, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
Irritable bowel syndrome sufferers are generally advised to avoid meat and dairy products. However, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid in the protein tryptophan helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen the intestinal tolerance.
According to the director of the study, Marco Colonna, immune cells guard the swamp and ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not enter the body.
Inflammatory cells are balanced by cells that strengthen tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to inflammation, irritated bowel syndrome may occur.
Tests showed that immune cells that enhance tolerance are present in mice with a specific bacteria in their intestines.
The bacteria in question need tryptophan to start developing immune cells. Tryptophan is one of the building materials of proteins.
"We found a connection between the development of Lactobacillus Reuter and the development of tolerance cells. Lactobacillus Reuter is part of normal intestinal microbes," says Professor Colonna.
"The more they had tryptophan in their diet, the more they had these immune cells."
If the same works in humans, a combination of Lactobacillus reuter and a high-triptophan diet can increase intestinal tolerance and reduce inflammatory sensitivity.
When examining immune cells that enhance tolerance, Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan observed that although one group of mice had such cells, they were not present in mice of the same mouse species that were kept separate from the other group.
He suspected that the difference was related to microbes in the intestine of mice, i.e. the normal community of bacteria, fungi and viruses in the gastrointestinal tract.
Six species of bacteria were found in mice with immune cells but not in other mice when DNA was tested in mice.
When Lactobacillus Reuter bacteria were administered to mice in a sterile environment that did not have intestinal microbes and did not develop immune cells, they began to develop immune cells.
Scientists wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system, growing Lactobacillus reuter bacteria in the fluid, transferring small amounts of fluid to immature immune cells isolated from mice without bacteria.
Immune cells developed into tolerable cells.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the metabolism of tryptophan known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice' diet, the number of tolerable cells increased by about 50 percent. When the number of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half from the previous time.
Cervantes-Barragan says that man has the same tolerance cells as the mouse, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuter bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether by-products of tryptophan from Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria can induce the development of cells in humans as in mice. However, genetic defects associated with tryptophan have been observed in patients with Irritated intestinal Syndrome.
"I think we want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation on the inside of the intestines," Cervantes-Barragan says.
"A high level of tryptophan in combination with Lactobacillus reuter bacteria may contribute to their spread."
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United got a genius in his ranks after he made a deal with Neman and Matic.
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United got a "nero" in his ranks after signing a contract with Nemanja Matic. Central field player debuted Manchester United in a fight against Sampdor on Wednesday night.
Matic, who moved from Chelsea to £40 million, began with a 2-1 victory in Dublin, the last time he fought the UEFA Super Cup tournament against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He impressed a defending midfield player against stars like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
But Matic wasn't in the best shape yet because he wasn't on the blue shirts Asian tour before the season started. He was only doing it for 45 minutes - according to Mourinho, it has to change before the championship season begins.
"He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence and his thinking make him a genius - he has the natural thinking power of football," says Mourinho.
"We'll help him be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, the newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelio Lukaku were starting the game at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho started to file its starting configuration for the start of the season.
Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, even though the club has already done a "great job" by acquiring three of his four top players.
"Three out of four - you have to thank the company," he added.
"I'll be happier if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."
The volleyball women bullied Germany for two rounds.
The Finnish women's volleyball team lost their fourth World Championship Championship match to Germany directly between 0 and 3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
German routine in gaming is high.
Their game was flat in every sector, the Finnish head coach Tapio Kangasniemi reported in the release.
In the first two rounds, Finland kept its opponent in a tight spot, but in the third round Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany's in charge of the block.
When we played patiently and in certain places aggressively enough, Kangasniemi said, we were able to swing along.
The most effective in Finland was Piia Korhonen, who collected 14 points.
Three out of four matches Finland will still face Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: The Grand Jury has already launched challenges related to Trump Jr.'s Russian meeting
In the United States, a large jury has sent challenges regarding the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The grand jury, convened by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, has already sent challenges to the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, known for the Kremlin connections.
This is reported by Reuters, a news agency that at the same time confirms the information that Wall Street Journal gave earlier on Thursday about the convening of a grand jury.
According to Reuters, the grand jury has sent challenges to the meeting between Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya, known for the Kremlin connections, which took place during the US presidential election in June 2016.
Paul Manafort, then campaign manager of Donald Trump Sr, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, current White House advisor, were also present.
According to Reuters' sources, the fact that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has summoned a grand jury in Washington means that the pace of the Russian investigation is getting tighter.
Sources add that Mueller wanted a grand jury to assist him with an investigation into Russia's involvement in the US presidential election and whether the Trump campaign or his associates cooperated with Russia.
The grand jury extends Mueller's rights to gather evidence, send out challenges and force people to testify on oath.
The grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens working behind closed doors.
The grand jury weighs the evidence the prosecutor has investigated and decides whether the case should be prosecuted.
A British inventor microchipd himself to get home and into his car with a wave of his hand.
The British inventor has been the first to microchip himself in the whole country so that he can open the front door of his home, get into his office and start his car with a swinging hand.
The microchip is between the thumb and forefinger of 33-year-old Steven Northam and now provides services to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with Northam's BioTeq technology.
Northam cooperates with Geoff Watson, an anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the installation of the microchip meets medical requirements.
The microchip uses a technique similar to that used for microchips in cats and dogs, and it takes only 30 seconds to install.
Northam's company also turns the locks on the houses and cars into compatible with the microchip. It costs 300 pounds to process one lock.
Northam is married and has one child who has installed microchip technology both in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which starts when he puts his hands on the steering wheel.
The White House exhibit cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The White House's decision last month to fly a naval helicopter to the southern field of the White House for an American production event costing taxpayers $24,000.
The Green White Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is called Marine One when the president is on board. It was the attraction of an event held at the White House on 17 July 2017 where American construction programs were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials took a look at the products from all 50 states.
In addition to a helicopter manufactured in Connecticut, there was a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House Military Bureau had requested the position of the helicopter by mission-specific order only about 36 hours before its landing on the southern lawn for an "extraordinary" event, as shown in the documentation of the naval HMX-1 helicopter fleet.
"I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of this because it is an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility," the commander of unit HMX-1 wrote the day before the incident in an e-mail to his superior, who is deputy commander of the Navy Airlift.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive on the southern grass field at 7 a.m. on July 17th and the event would start at 3 a.m. only after the field was cleared between 6 and 9 p.m.
In addition, the message mentioned that if the helicopter was delayed leaving the White House, another crew would be needed to arrive because of restrictions on service times.
The original crew was in the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security personnel were at the helicopter when it was on the ground.
It is not clear from the documents provided by Time magazine whether another crew was eventually needed.
The U.S. Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 asked if the event was a violation of the law.
"One of our questions was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act. We were told not to be broken," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you can take part," answered the Deputy Commandant.
Made in America was an official White House event, so it was not covered by Hatch Act.
But even the official events have political shades.
At that time, the President spoke in favour of the reform of health care in the Senate and more lax state regulation.
The use of Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
They have to be used by the presidents on their travels.
but their use only for photographs is unusual.
Trump's actions attracted attention in February when Air Force One rolled into the background of the Presidential campaign event in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticised the use of his predecessor's presidential aircraft on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with Made in America's exhibition of products made by American workers from all 50 states," said Lindsay Walters, White House Press Secretary.
HMX-1 crews regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and train on the southern lawn to bring the president to the White House with a centimeter accuracy.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 made 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one official, flights to the Made in America event were part of the crew's monthly training quota.
The unit helicopters also operated 11 hours on "non-presidential support missions' that day.
According to the White House, the event did not involve any other costs for taxpayers.
Sikorsky's spokesman explained that the company was not involved in organising a helicopter demonstration on the southern white house lawn field.
HMX-1 has no records of flights related to the duties of the President, and it is difficult to accurately estimate the cost of the event.
According to the Ministry of Defence's hourly allowances for 2017, the VH-3D helicopter has a replacement level of $24 380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 files, flights from Quantico base to the White House from Virginia and back lasted for a total of one hour.
According to the White House, the operating costs of the helicopter are clearly lower.
"The calculation of the costs for taxpayers according to the level of compensation is misleading," says Walters.
"The estimated level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called sunk costs that will be taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 study carried out by the RAND study company, compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, the former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter at the event.
"The idea is to introduce American production," Spicer said.
"I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are extremely proud that they are involved in ensuring national security and therefore employ hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which many Americans have worked hard.
It is perfectly appropriate to bring it up."
It's not certain if Trump was in the helicopter during the event, but at least he sat down in the fire truck driver's seat.
In the White House, Trump made jokes to the press about his own Sikorsky squadron.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said. "I have three."
Lightning hit the Vaasan track - trains have to be replaced by buses
Passenger train traffic between Seinäjoki and Vaasa is broken due to a technical defect, says the Railway Traffic Centre.
For the time being, trains will be replaced by buses.
The fault of the traffic control system was caused by thunder.
The railway centre had not yet had an estimate of the duration of the repair in the morning.
The Venezuelan State Prosecutor requests the right to prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country.
The Venezuelan State Prosecutor has applied for a court ruling preventing the appointment of a new representative body in the country.
The Venezuelan President, Nicolas Maduro, has announced that the delegation elected last Sunday will be appointed on Friday.
In the contested vote, a delegation was elected to the country, which could, among other things, change the constitution of the country.
According to Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega, an injunction has been requested for suspicions of electoral fraud.
Ortega has also started an investigation into electoral fraud.
He appointed two judges after the British company which held the vote on behalf of representatives told us that the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only the allies of Maduro were nominated for representation, and the elected assembly of 545 members includes, among other things, the son and wife of Maduro.
In addition to amending the Constitution, the Congress led by the opposition can be dissolved by the assembly and amended by the law.
Maduro described as a dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition considers the amendment of the Constitution to be a way for Maduro to strengthen his position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called him a dictator.
For their part, the European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have announced that they will not recognise the new representation.
Mr Maduro claims that the new representation is the solution to the political and economic crisis in the country.
In Venezuela, unrest has been going on for months.
They have wounded numerous people and more than 100 people have died.
Venezuela fell into an economic crisis after the fall in oil prices.
Now many people cannot afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to express its opinion on Friday, when the new assembly is to begin.
A Russian man handed over by Finland was sentenced to 4 years in prison in the United States
On Thursday, the Minneapolis court in the United States sentenced 41-year-old Maxim Senah to nearly four years in prison for involvement in a global computer fraud.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 following a request made by the United States.
According to the Russian magazine Fontanka, Senah had been on holiday in Finland.
He was arrested by the Finnish border authorities when he was returning home.
In February 2016, Finland handed over Senah to the U.S. judicial authorities despite Russian protests, reports the news agency AFP.
In March of this year he was found guilty of computer fraud that had benefited millions of dollars.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah will be deported after the prison sentence has been executed.
After the arrest, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs harshly reproached Finland and said that a man should not be handed over to the United States.
The statement blamed Finland and the United States for the fact that the arrest took place in Finland without Russia knowing beforehand.
According to the D.A., Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury that infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to fish for user names and passwords.
Cheaters then used the data by continuing to control internet traffic, which used to make clicks and spread spam.
According to Kenneth Blanco, the Acting Director of the Criminal Division of the Ministry of Justice, the case shows that the United States is also capable of targeting other cyber criminals.
We have the ability and the desire to identify, find and bring them to justice," Blanco explained in a press release.
Edit at 8:58 p.m. Corrected by literation of the name of the sentenced person.

The man has admitted in the preliminary talk that he caused the damage and that he has done wrong.
The article headlined by Timo Soin with a question mark: "After that came the Flood"
On Thursday, Foreign Minister Timo Soini (uv.) published a blog article headlined with a question mark.
The article is short, only two sentences long.
In my day, the party grew from zero to a government party of thirty-seven MPs.
After that came the Flood, now everything floats, Soini writes.
Soin's text contains references to 18th-century France.
King Louis XV or this mistress, Madame de Pompador, is known to have used the flood parable.
Depending on interpretation, the passages in the history books are "after us the Flood" or "after me the Flood."
According to the UN, democracy in Afghanistan depends on the political role of women
The elections will only be representative if all members of society, including women, can vote in them, said the head of the UN delegation in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, interim director of the UN Relief Mission, said that hundreds of women are nominated for elections to the provincial councils, three women are running for vice-presidentship and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overemphasised," said Haysom in his statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be genuinely representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all aspects of the electoral process.
The provincial council and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban has made threats to the elections at the same time as international forces are moving towards an advisory role.
This year's elections will be the first time that power has been transferred peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Mr Haysom said that women's contribution would strengthen democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

A flood of certain types of tourists threatens the culture of the region
Authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
Local rage is particularly directed towards the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister for Culture calls it "eat and flee" tourism: there are only a few hours at the site and rushing through the sights in large numbers.
Venice is choked on tourists who make quick day trips to the city.
In narrow streets it is difficult to move and the fine squares are so crowded with visitors that the inhabitants of Venice will no longer fit in.
They have been forced to move further and further away from the historic center, while homes have been replaced by hotels.
The New York Times and The Guardian write about the problems of tourism in Venice.
Authorities are considering restrictions on the number of tourists.
They call the current phenomenon poor quality tourism - low-quality tourism.
When arriving on a large cruise ship, two or three hours are allowed.
You follow the ticket guide to the Piazzale Roma Rialto Bridge and St Mark's Square, and turn back, describes the prevailing and problematic tourism of Italian Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture but also in the operation of the place, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this part of the identity of cities.
St Mark's Square is also one of the most popular places to visit the historic centre of Venice.
On the edge of the square lies the Church of St Mark.
Local anger is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
There are only 50,000 locals living in the historic centre of Venice.
In 1951, there were about 175,000 inhabitants.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians protested against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroys the environment and drives the inhabitants away.
About 2,000 people leave every year.
If this continues, in a few years there will be no more than tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historic disaster, says Carlo Belframe, who was organising the demonstration.
The equation is difficult because ships bring to Venice the income that it desperately needs and create the need for numerous jobs in different sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, it is envisaged that cruisers would go further away from the historic center.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, felt that the situation would certainly change if the administrative region of Veneto, where Venice is also located, had more power to decide its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
Every year about 20-30 million tourists visit Venice.
Are you driving towards Kuopio?
Traffic on the highway is bad for miles
On the motorway between Kuopio and Siilinjärvi, the northern lane has had traffic congestion of kilometres during the return traffic from Thursday afternoon work.
The motorway coating work is being carried out in the area, which slows down traffic," says Savon Sanomat.
For road work, the speed limit is 50 km/h instead of the normal speed of 120 km/h.
However, even in a restricted area of 50 km, traffic had progressed in some places on Thursday afternoons at a practical pace of walking.
On Thursday afternoon, on the side of Lake Siilin, the stove of Revelation, or golden deer, progressed.
I get along well without that kind of attention.
A 23-year-old runner has been forced to notice the curses of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has published fantastic pictures of herself in the Grand Canyon landscape, among others.
Amalie Iuel, a Danish-Norwegian, has become a popular athlete in her current country, Norway, not least because she broke the record of 26 years old Norway in a 400-metre race by rotating at the time of the track round 51.81 in March.
A month later, he improved the 400 - meter fence run at the Norwegian record of 55.38.
Soon after his record, Iuel, a hard-working social media user, discovered that celebrity and publicity have their drawbacks.
Men around the world began to send pictures of their genitals to Luel, apparently in the hope that the young runner would be interested in them.
I thought it had to be closed off from outside of his Snapchat account.
I got a lot of "punk pictures" from people I didn't know, so I had to turn my account private," Luel told VG magazine.
In an interview with VG, Iuel did not want to identify exactly what photos he received.
You can probably guess, I think he was laughing.
It's nice to get feedback after the run, but I get along well without that kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, his father is Danish-Norwegian.
The Iuel family moved to Norway when Amalie was 2 years old.
When Amalie was 12 years old, the family first moved to Namibia, then Pakistan, because of his father's work.
After that, Dubai, Thailand and the United States took the turn.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, from which he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains with three coaches, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to discussion than the United States.
In the United States, coaches ask no questions but simply give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to deal personally with the athlete," Iuel said to VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norway's records at 400 metres and 400 metres in a fence run.
The foot injury put the whole career of snowboarder Janne Korve at stake - now involved in the World Championship: "Nice not to hurt anything"
It's been nice to count now that nothing's happened!
Janne Korpi, 31, one of Finland's most successful snowboarders, has been able to enjoy his beloved sport again this season.
Last summer, the career was at stake.
The stress injury on the footboard had forced the Korve to operate in January, and the foot didn't want to heal.
The hand had also taken a hit in the race.
In the summer, I had no idea what I was doing, whether the board was going on or not.
Sponsor deals were in rehab and many things were open," says Korpi.
But that's what they say. Things tend to work out.
The leg improved, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood started pulling back up the hill.
Afterwards, the decision was easy.
I didn't know that until the first time I snowed.
I was like, "Oh, hell, yeah, this is so funny, let's go a couple more ways."
Raven didn't get a good count until September and October, but after a long landing break, it's been a big deal.
There's only a handful of Kisoja Raven around.
It's okay.
The competitions have never been the most important aspect of boarding for Korve.
I've never counted for one race.
I find it frustrating to aim for four years in one race, and then you're in a fever for that week.
I can't think like that, Raven says.
Today Raven is competing at the World Cup in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Even though individual races do not hold him on board, he always gets caught up in heavy company.
According to Korve, the prestige of the International Ski Association has increased over the past few years, although some of the boarders chose the X-Games of Norway to be held at the same time.
Yeah, it's a big race. It's a big view.
True, in my opinion, appreciation always depends on the circumstances and level of the games.
Raven in Sierra Nevada is the oldest athlete in Finland's 12-person team.
The team's youngest, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parksenniemi are 14 years younger than Korpea.
It's nice to watch younger friends go.
I remember when I was at the point where everything was new and so sickly excited about everything.
It brings new power to itself. Raven thinks.
In the chest, I'll keep up somehow, but otherwise I won't, that's the amount of power in the guys!
In the background of the boarding career, Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career.
The son of director legend Pekka Korve is addicted to racing sports: the boarder has his own racehorses for which he makes training programs.
When I'm on the road all the time, there's no more time to be in the mess.
But every day I watch at least the race results and usually even some departures," says Korpi.
According to Korve, racing and racing coaching are a potential career plan when a career on board is completed in due course.
I don't want to plan that far, but at least it's a likely option.
I'm going to experience it so much that it's like I'm studying it here, along with snowboarding.
I'm trying to stay on the edge of time and develop, maybe in the summer drive some kind of departures.
If it's my future occupation, then it's not hard to start when you're already inside the sport.
Ravi stories also include the Elitloppet cruise with host Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The two have chartered a cruise ship that will head to Stockholm at the end of May for the Elitloppet race.
Raven and Linnonmaa decided to revive the old tradition.
The cruise has been very commercial, and people have been excited.
We're already at the point where there's not going to be a bankruptcy.
There's still a few months left. Let's hope we can fill the ship," Raven says excitedly.
Attendo's nursing home project for Kitee has surprised everyone
Attendo Esther is the name of a new care home for 41-seat elderly people to be built for Kitee.
The building of over 1,700 square meters of floor area is expected to be completed next summer on the other side of the Health Road of the health centre's neighbor.
With crystal, the common wondering is where the customers are enough for the new nursing unit, for now during the Siu Wars many private nursing homes are suffering from customer shortages.
Anne Flink of Attendo, Regional Director of Care Services, commented that Kite will have increased demand not only for alternatives but also for enhanced service housing in the future.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice works better," Flink says.
Last year Attendo bought Kite's private nursing homes in Kanervikkola and Eerika.
The deal was about business, but there's a five-year lease on real estate.
Flink says Attendo doesn't have an acute need to move operations away from these premises.
More on the subject later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the McVitie's brand factory in Scotland
The trade union seeks confirmation from the leaders of the McVitie's cookie manufacturer of the long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
According to the Scottish branch of the British general trade union GMB, the company has not reported on its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The factory for Hobnobs and Rich Tea and other products has over 500 employees.
The company Pladis, which owns the McVitie's brand, reported that it invested more than £5 million in the factory in recent years.
The company added that employees and trade union representatives "will be the first to be reported" if changes are to occur.
In its letter to the factory manager, GMB calls on the company "to respond to the concerns that no funding has been allocated to the modernisation of production lines."
Drew Duffy of the GMB trade union finds it extremely worrying that the factory manager is not given clear information on the business needs and future investment plans of Tollcross.
"Families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce has concentrated heavily on the local community and the Glasgow metropolitan area.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and livelihoods, and Brexit, rising cost of living and constantly reducing production, East Glasgow desperately needs successful McVitie's production."
According to Pladis's spokesman, the factory manager had only received a trade union letter the day before and the company responded directly because it appreciates continuous interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, when we discussed several issues openly.
We discussed with employees, among other things, the fact that, like other companies operating in highly competitive and uncertain markets, we constantly assess all our business activities and locations in order to maintain our competitiveness."
According to the spokesman, the company has invested more than £5 million in the Tollcross plant in recent years, in particular in its production lines and improving its operations.
"We are aware of the long history of Tollcross as a production plant and will certainly be the first to tell employees and trade union representatives if we are going to make changes to the plant'.
Did the PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's transfer three years ago?
LaLiga may regret her interest in Marco Verrat
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up the pursuit of Neymar after paying £ 189 million to terminate the contract, but did the PSG warn Barcelona of a record transfer three years ago?
The French league 1 football team is ready to break the world record of the transfer numbers. The previous record was less than half lower: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with £89 million.
After the transfer, Neymar will be the world's most expensive football player and also the world's best-paid professional athlete, as the PSG will offer him more than £500,000 a week after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be furious about the PSG's activities and the way Neymar has been forced out of the company. A source close to Barcelona tells us that the Society has taken very good care of Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the chairman of the PSG warn the football world about this transfer three years ago?
When Manchester City announced its interest in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif warned about PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they're after our players, we'll be their opponent and we'll contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they're after our players, they'll have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have done just this: it expressed its interest in the PSG's midfield player Marco Verrat earlier this summer.
The PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances. It may well be that Barcelona will lose its star player Neymar as a result.
Neste slowed the stock market rise - Stock exchange news - Evening Words

Now, the calls Trump made were made up by a White House spokesman, "I wouldn't say it was a lie."
The White House admits that two calls mentioned by President Donald Trump never happened, reports the New York Times.
Trump's incensed calls with both the President of Mexico and the leader of the Scout organization have proved to be invented.
The White House publicist Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had been made.
But he said Trump wasn't lying.
According to Sanders, many of the lead scouts spoke to Trump personally, and the president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, had spoken to him at the G20 meeting in Hamburg.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty tough accusation.
Those conversations happened, not just on the phone, but face-to-face, Sanders reasoned.
Speech to Scouts Aroused Disapproval
On Monday, Trump said that the President of Mexico called him and praised Trump's success in eradicating illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto told us that few people will ever cross the southern border of Mexico because they know that a trip to the U.S. border will be blocked anyway.
On Wednesday, the Mexican government issued a press release saying that this call had not taken place.
On Tuesday, Politico published a complete version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
There Trump glowed his speech at a major meeting of the National Scout Organization in West Virginia.
I got a call from the head of the Boy Scouts, he said it was the finest speech they've ever had.
They were very grateful, Trump told me.
On Wednesday, the Boy Scout's organization announced that it was not aware of any of its executives' call to Trump.
According to the press release, Michael Surbaugh, the director of the organization, in which he had asked Trump to speak for forgiveness from the scouts, speaks for himself.
Trump's speech at the meeting of the Boy Scout's organization raised a great deal of wonder, as it was exceptionally political in view of the nature of the event.
Among other things, he glowed at the results of last autumn's presidential elections.
