The City of Juankoski joins the City of Kuopio in early 2017.
Kuopio City Council unanimously approved the association on Monday.
Juankoski City Council approved the alliance last week.
The municipality of Tuusniemi was also involved in the settlement of the municipal union, but its council decided that Tuusniemi would continue to be independent.
Kuopio and Juankoski decide on the implementation of the following municipal elections separately.
Municipal elections will next be held in 2016.
After the accession of Juankoski, the population of Kuopio will be around 111 000.

Putin: Ukrainian troops shoot civilians
On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed Kiev's leadership for refusing direct political talks with the separatists in eastern Ukraine.
At the moment, Kiev's leadership does not want to conduct an essential political debate with the eastern part of its country," Putin said itar-Tass.
He also said that Russian-minded separatists, who are said to be assisted by Kiev and the West by the Russian army, tried to push Ukrainian troops further away from their current positions where Putin said that Ukrainian army troops are shooting civilians.
The goal of the militia fighters is to push away these armed forces and their artillery so that they do not get the chance to shoot the inhabitants of the area," Putin said.
The event took place on Friday and Saturday at the Ryrmi workshop.
It surprised me that people came from the very beginning of the evening.
There were visitors for two days as expected," says promoter Tom Kangas.
The Seinäjoki Hiphop Festival was organized for the third time.
Next year again.
We're still gonna be a hip-hop festival, so there's no pop, Kangas assures us.
Finland enters into force on Tuesday a law restricting the acquisition of substances suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In the future, private individuals will have to apply to the Police Administration for permission to purchase or hold substances or mixtures that could be used as the starting material for explosives.
These substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate and mixtures containing them if the prescribed concentration values are exceeded.
Hydrogen peroxide is present, for example, in detergents and detergents, but concentrations generally do not exceed the limit values.
Nitromethane is used for acceleration, for example.
However, starting materials acquired before the entry into force of the Act may be held and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster is charged with the hotel rape of Nairn and Pitolochry.
There's a trial pending for rapes in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, heard the charges before the Glasgow Supreme Court.
He is charged with rape at the Pitlochry Scotland's Hotel in Perthshire Province on June 7, 2013.
Webster is accused of attacking a woman "when she is unconscious, asleep, and thus unable to make a decision for herself."
Webster is also charged with another rape at the Golf View Hotel in the Highlands in Nairn on 4 May 2014.
In accordance with the decision of Judge Lady Rae, the proceedings will be held in Edinburgh on 17 November before the Supreme Court.
Championship: Super Raheem shined - Mario was overshadowed - Championship - Evening Words
Only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling once again showed why he is viewed as a hope for the future of English football.
White Hart Lane had an electric atmosphere on Sunday when Liverpool, which was strengthened at Mario Balotelli, arrived as a guest of Tottenham.
Super Mario's first performance was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian working in the field with a completely different attitude from that of Manchester City.
The Balotelli was still a long way from its peak.
The Italian lost three quality goals and fed only half of his sixteen pitches to his own team.
The Player's already favorite Pool supporters expect better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers placed Balotelli in the role of Luis Suarez, who travelled to Barcelona, as the team's second attacker alongside Daniel Sturridge.
As a star of the team, instead of Balotelli, the tip of the center field diamond, Raheem Sterling, poked the 3-0 win past the important opening goal of Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, doesn't just look good.
The Englishman 20 centimeters shorter than the Balotelli is between the opponent's lines than the fish in the water.
The feature is not common for a player who races the grass at its best at a speed of about 34 kilometers per hour.
Mr Rodgers too deserves great thanks for the progress made by Mr Sterling.
After the match, the Northern Irishman told us how Liverpool has systematically developed a more comprehensive player from the Northwestern Honda, which grew at the foot of Wembley.
Susanna Mälkki was chosen as the chief conductor of the Helsinki City Orchestra - "I am happy and proud"
The Helsinki City Board has decided to appoint Susanna Mäklin Helsinki City Orchestra as the next executive conductor since autumn 2016.
The magazines, including the Los Angeles Times, have asked which orchestra he will take next.
Susanna Mälkki says that she will begin her new assignment with joy and pride.
The Helsinki City Orchestra has played a key role in our country's music life for over a hundred years, including by introducing a large number of Sibelius' music.
The orchestra has been led by the best Finnish conductors and I have worked with many members of the orchestra before.
I look forward to our future cooperation with enthusiasm," he says.
Administrations of wage-earners' organisations in the context of the pension negotiation - Domestic - Regions - News - Karjalainen
Today we are looking for a new impetus for the pension negotiations from the social partners' own meetings.
The governance of the SAK, Akava and STK employees' organisations will discuss the negotiating situation in the morning.
After that, the actual pension negotiations will continue.
The social partners have, among other things, been subjected to a dispute over the linking of retirement ages to life expectancy.
The organizations have promised a career solution by autumn, but according to the latest estimate it would be in the course of this week.
Plier puddas.
Woman Volley, a women's volleyball team in Rovaniemi, stumbled on the league sorcerers of Vampula at the finals of the training tournament.
The vampire bent five to win a stretching match of 3-2.
Last round WoVo lost 15-11.
The neighbor was one step ahead all the time.
The fight was good, but in defense and passport games Vampula was a little better, saw WoVo coach Teemu Mäkikyro.
WoVo's spruce was a bit of a mess in that a six-inch American journalist, Jennifer Keddy, was stuck on the side of his back.
Sara Niemi played as a center.
Karoliina Kyllönen, despite her thumb injury, was able to play with Johanna Pekkarinen and formed WoVo's most powerful combination.
Jenna Keskimäki, who started as a hacker, was allowed to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 rounds.
The best part of the vampula was a skilled Russian pastor and Libero Hillaelina Hämäläinen, who WoVo toured as much as possible.
WoVo's preparations for the league continue next weekend when Hämeenlinna HPK comes to training camp in Rovaniemi.
The team will meet on Saturday at the "Commerce" at 6 p.m. in an official training game.
On Sunday we meet again at the sports college.

The company released its results on Monday.
Lidl now has 142 stores in Finland, and the expansion is planned to continue.
Lidl also explained that he paid nearly EUR 14 million in taxes to Finland for the last financial year.
Lidl Finland is part of the German Lidl Group.
The company has over 4 200 employees in Finland.
Ovarian cancer is more frequently killed in sparsely populated areas due to delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have published the video as a tribute to her mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia have a higher risk of ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
Researchers reviewed the medical records of over 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35 percent of women lived more than five years after diagnosis.
Chief Researcher Susan Jordan from the Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20% more likely to die during the survey than women living in urban areas.
SMALL RESEARCH: New medicines may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers went through women's health history for seven years.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, the age of a woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, previous diseases, and socio-economic status also contributed to the chances of survival.
In older women and when cancer was more widespread at the time of diagnosis, the likelihood of survival was lowest.
Women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20% more likely to die during the survey than women living in urban areas.
The study did not seek to determine why women living outside cities are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment as possible reasons.
"Gynaecological oncologists treat this disease best, and their receptions are mostly located in large cities," Jordan says.
Although teleservice treatments are becoming more widespread and the importance of distance is reduced, the researcher also suggests increasing the mobility of doctors so that patients can be treated closer to their home by specialist doctors, as well as programmes to support patients who are far away from home.
According to Dr. Jordan's study, the long-term survival rate of women with ovarian cancer is poor regardless of geographical location, stressing the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programs.
A study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old family mother living in Gold Coast, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The City of Rovaniemi wants to confirm the sled parking in Friendship Park, located next to the hotel Pohjanhovi.
On Monday, the City Board decided that the proposal for a location plan for the Friendship Park and its surroundings will be placed on public display at a service point in Osvitta.
Opinions on the plan proposal are requested from the Environmental Board and the Lapland Centre.
Through a change in the layout, the city wants to enable the continuing snowmobile activity related to tourism in the region.
The park area is to be formed, which includes the area between the current Friendship Park and the river and the park.
According to the proposal, between 15 November and 30 April, the maximum number of snowmobiles available on site is 200.
The designated part of the area is also eligible for filling points.
Service services are also allowed for the new park area.
The City of Rovaniemi has rented the Friendship Park area to safari companies for snowmobiling in winter.
The tenancy agreement was last renewed in spring 2014 and is valid for spring 2018.
Sled parking and the change in design have raised even loud opposition.
People in the neighboring blocks of flats have been upset about both the sound and the concern about emissions.
However, emissions in the area have been investigated and no findings above the guide values have been identified.
The new equipment is also less polluting than the old one.
The parking lot is also supported by the fact that if the place of departure was to be moved further away, the hotel's safari customers would have to be transported to the safaris by buses estimated to have 15 departures per day.
According to the city, the area and surrounding area of the Friendship Park is also large enough for the sleds, better than the places presented as replacement points such as the eastern side of the Ounas River Bridges.
The Friendship Park is also good for its location because activities can be expanded in the future, for example in the Ounaspavilion area.
The consolidation of parking is part of the urban strategy adopted by the City Council of Rovaniemi, according to which the city's objective is, inter alia, to create a good framework for business activities by providing sufficient quality areas for logistically and functionally advantageous locations.
The Friendship Park is also marked as the starting point for snowmobiling in the city center, which has not yet been given legal force.
The fall in owner-occupied dwellings is visible in garden shops
The decline in the number of homeowners, especially in the group under 35, may lead to a decrease in the turnover of garden stores by tens of millions, as today's young consumers reach the "main target group" of garden sales.
According to the Financial Times report, renters spend only 55 percent of the money they spend on gardening.
The study had also shown that more and more people live in very urban apartments without gardens, and that the size of the garden is also reduced as the front yard is increasingly paved as a parking lot, and these factors also threaten the garden area, which is estimated at £5 billion per year.
In the London area, housing ownership has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, where garden products are used least per household in the whole country.
However, according to HTA and the British Garden Association (RHS), the increase in rent or the decrease in the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, RHS's leading garden counsellor, says that "plants grown in mobile farming vessels, for example, are particularly popular among tenants because such vessels can be included in the change if necessary'.
According to the HTA report, the years 1997-2005 were a booming period for the re-sales of the gardening sector, as the ownership and wealth of dwellings increased from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that trade will increase this year due to better weather conditions, since last year's March and April weather was poorer.
Turkey interrogates the American diplomat because of a spy report
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has invited the country's most experienced US diplomat to report on the report on espionage by Americans and British people in Turkey.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Bullent, the report was discussed on Monday by the U.S. Embassy's attorney and the Turkish authorities.
The German newspaper Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept have written that the documents leaked by former analyst Edward Snowden of the National Security Agency (NSA) reveal that Turkey was the main espionage target for intelligence services in the United States and Great Britain.
According to Turkish news agencies, the Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, underestimated the importance of the report, saying that all the large countries have spied on each other.
The previous report on the espionage of Ankara by Germany's main intelligence service produced a more angry reaction in the Turkish government.
Cannes winner Croze will perform in a new Finnish film
The Canadian actor Marie-Josée Croze, who has appeared in several successful films, is attached to the leading female character in the new Finnish film.
Croze plays in director Mikko Copperinen's film 2 nights into the morning, whose shoots start this week in Lithuania.
Croze won the award for his role in the Barbarian invasion in 2003 at Cannes Film Festival.
Among other things, he has performed in Steven Spielberg's film Munich and Julian Schnabel's in Butterfly Glass Dome.
Mikko Nousiainen is the leading man in the 2 nights to the morning film.
The film will have its Finnish premiere in September 2015.
Chief of the Mallorcan Magaluf Police, charged with corruption
Evidence of extortion by police officers and officials of the Calvià City Government at the Mallorca Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday was provided by those who gave evidence.
The chief of police of Calvià, Mallorca Island, has been arrested for having a damp party following allegations of corruption by the known owners of the Magaluf region.
Captain José Antonio Navarro was placed in custody after several owners of Punta Ballena Street filed charges of corruption against him. Most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located on Punta Ballena Street.
According to the online daily newspaper Mallorca Diario, the case revealed evidence of extortion by police officers and officials of the Calvià City Government at the Mallorca Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish National Guard in connection with the charges of corruption and are being interrogated by a judge together with Navarro.
The daily ABC, published throughout the country, wrote about the patronage of the pissed - off authorities of club owners, which made their business very difficult.
"It's no longer about money, it's about survival," said one store owner to the court.
You will not destroy our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in the headlines of magazines in several countries this summer, as a YouTube video spread online, where an 18-year-old British holidaymaker had oral sex with 24 men during the so-called pub crawl.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to curb the drunken and uncontrolled behavior of Magaluf holidaymakers by reducing the number of infamous, drunken pub crawls.
In addition, the Playhouse Night Club, where the oral sex video was filmed, was ordered to close for a year, and the owner of the nightclub and the organizer of the pub crawl were fined jointly for EUR 55 000.
Above all, among young British tourists, the popular tourist destination of Magaluf has also become popular with the so-called balcony trend, which has caused several accidents caused by alcohol consumption when people have jumped from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
Israelite Children Return to School After the Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters when rockets and mortars bombed their communities in the 50-day Israeli-Hamas war and schools remained closed as the region recovered from the fighting.
The opening of schools brought joy and excitement to rocket - bombed communities in southern Israel, but the tracks of battles are still visible.
In the town of Ashdod in the south, in the Pashosh day care centre, workers removed shrapnel marks from the walls and slides before children arrived in the day care centre after the rocket struck.
"We're a little scared, but we're also excited," says Ronit Bart, who lives in a Kibbuts called Saad, an Israeli commune, and works as an English teacher at the city school.
Many children in this area desperately need routines.
Bart's 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, thinks she's going back to school after a long time, it's a little weird.
"We have had difficult times at times when we didn't leave home," he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbuts near the Gaza Strip to offer his support.
Before the start of last week's ceasefire, thousands of inhabitants of border communities like Saad had stayed indoors or had left their homes for safer areas away from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many of the inhabitants of the Nahal Oz community near the Gaza front are sceptical about the return of the Palestinian grenade after killing a 4-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, more than ten families had not yet returned.
The children of these families have so far been placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the school in Sderot, a city near the Gaza border, which was the subject of heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that "the education and safety of children" would be taken care of.
Israel and Hamas agreed on an open ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately halted the fighting, but it did not solve many key issues such as Hamas's call to lift the blockade of Israel and Egypt and to reopen the air and sea roads in Gaza.
Israel wants to disarm Hamas and return the body of two Israelite soldiers killed in the war.
Egypt is expected to launch a new round of indirect negotiations later this month.
According to estimates by Palestine and the UN, more than 2 100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of which were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of deaths, according to which at least half of the dead were soldiers, although it had no solid evidence of this.
66 soldiers and six civilians died on the Israeli side, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gaza soldiers fired 4,591 rockets and mortars into Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
The Israeli army, in turn, carried out over 5 000 air strikes and other attacks.
Israel's attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250 000 people fled to cover more than 100 UN schools that had been converted into temporary shelters.
Tens of thousands of people were still under shelter and as the fighting continued, school officials moved the beginning of school the week before.
"I hope that school opens soon and we get back to school, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children," said 13-year-old Mohammad Amara, who lives in a school in the city of Gaza.
According to a commonly used indicator, house prices have risen most in seven years in Australia's winter months.
The price index for Australian capital dwellings, RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic, rose by 1.1% in August, was shown by RP data on Monday.
As a result of this rise, prices rose in June, July and August by a total of 4.2 per cent, i.e. more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, which is more than twice as high as during the 12 months preceding August 2013, but prices have not increased steadily across the country.
According to RP Data's research director Tim Lawless, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the rise in prices.
The results of RP Data show that housing prices rose by 16.1% in Sydney and 11.7% in Melbourne the year before.
The housing market for Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin is next the busiest; the average price increase is from five to six per cent.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent per year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Lawless, spring in Australia will increase the number of dwellings for sale in the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
"In view of the increase in sales of dwellings to be auctioned, the overall high sales rate and the continuing low interest rates, it is likely that house prices will continue to rise over the next three months," says Lawless.
The new Gösta Museum has attracted record audiences to Mänttä
The new museum and visual art have attracted record audiences this summer in Mänttä.
By the end of August, more than 70,000 visitors have visited the Serlachius Art Museum.
The new Gösta Museum was opened in June and has featured classic works of pop art from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
Mänttä Art Weeks again told me that they had set a visitor record on Monday after 14 500 interested people had visited the Hekinen event this summer.
These figures are not used to.
People have been shrouded in doors and windows," says Director Pauli Sivonen of the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the total number of visitors to the Serlachius Museums this year will be approaching 100,000.
In previous years, there have been around 40 000 visitors.
The Mänttä-Vilppula in the middle of Tampere and Jyväskylä has about 11 000 inhabitants.
Museum Director Sivonen reminds us that new museums are always phenomena when they open up.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
In fact, it is hoped that the art age will continue far beyond the summer.
New exhibitions will be opened at the Art Museum in the autumn.
Police are investigating four recent thefts in Kajaani.
On Sunday night, a business property was broken into by breaking a window.
Whoever did this had gotten a small amount of money from the cash register.
Between Thursday and Monday, Syväojankatu had stolen fuel from a truck tank.
On the other hand, between Sunday and Monday the boat and its outboard engines had been taken from the port of the boat.
The rowing boat was light and yellow on the outside.
On the inside side, it said "OIVA."
A couple of suspects were already caught by the police.
On Sunday night, a business property was broken into.
A police dog got a mark and a 20-year-old Paltamo man was found hiding under a tree in the woods.
On Monday, the police grabbed another man from Paltamo who was also suspected of committing the same burglary.
Missing amphetamines brought a murder charge in Kajaani.
The disappearance of less than ten grams of amphetamines brought a murder charge to a Kajaan man born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, he and his common-law husband had gone into the apartment and shot a shotgun at the owner of the apartment, a 34-year-old Kajaan woman.
The defendant denied the charge and claimed that the other man with him was the shooter.
The case came to the attention of the police when a police patrol stopped a car in which a party was burning blood - used clothing.
In addition to the burns, a fired shotgun was found in the car.
The District Court of Kainuu will give its verdict later.
August was unusually warm in many places.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, an equally warm August is repeated on average once every ten years.
Statistics from the Finnish Meteorological Institute show that the average temperature in the whole country was higher than usual.
In most of the country, the deviation was from one to two degrees.
Due to the heats of July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature in the whole summer was measured in the first week of August in Pori, where the meter showed 32.8 degrees Fahrenheit.
Lenny Henry says, "My father never hugged me."
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born in a seven - year - old family of migrants from Jamaica in Dudley, Britain, in the Midlands region of 1958.
Henry's father worked at the factory and died when Henry was 19 years old.
Henry is currently practicing for the Rudy's Rare Records comedy show, partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and developed on the basis of a series of Radio 4 channels.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and degenerate upbeat.
Henry's had to go through some painful childhood memories.
She has been in therapy several times since her mother died, and she ponders much about her relationship with her father.
Dad was very difficult to read.
His face was never seen, only the voice said, "Stop the noise."
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I'm looking at cricket now.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, visited the pub with the father and discussed, for example, the form of beer doctrine or the beauty of cricketing.
I never talked to him about such things.
Most of my life he was to me that smiling man in the corner reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal molding plant in Dudley and thus got an idea of what his father's life must have been like, although working conditions are better today than at the time.
Melthouses are now a little brighter, but they are practically dark, smoky, mazelike depths, with flames, smoke, and soot bursting, and they remind me of the grave.
Dad used to take a bath and just lie in the bathtub, and slowly he began singing to himself as he washed the dirt out of the melting plant.
As I walked around the thawing shop, I realized that he had been working on it for years to get us food on the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry's childhood lacked the closeness of his parents.
My father never hugged me, never said he loved me.
It was only when my mother began to get sick just before she died that we began to repeat to each other that we loved each other.
Henry has a daughter named Billie with Dawn French, and through her own child she has been able to share the love she lacked as a child.
Do you have to keep saying "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry is still a good friend of French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn's a good person.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to Mother's death.
When I began to suffer from heavy overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to turn around.
After that, I started working out a lot, and I also had to start a heavy diet to reduce the symptoms.
It's very difficult...
And boring.
Nobody enjoys eating carrots.
Henry's well-known, short beard may describe his change during career development.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from critics about his role as Othello, he is immersed in making the theater.
Next came the Comedy of Mistakes and the Fences of August Wilson ("The Aids").
Making the theater offers a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that Henry has been doing throughout his busy career.
Henry started in the business when he was only a 16-year-old factory worker.
A DJ spotted him on stage doing impressions and contacted the New Faces talent show.
Henry's TV career began in the mid-70s. "For almost a long time I was the only black impersonator and comedian on TV," he says.
Henry learned when he was working.
I had to grow up in the spotlight of the public, I had to learn to produce jokes from a conveyor belt between 1975 and 1985, while I was living in stardom and I was on television.
Lenny New Faces in 1975
Henry's manager had stage rights for The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program where people played black makeup, so Henry ended up a comedian on the show for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never participated in it, but I do not regret it.
Although my position was strange and disapproving, I was able to work in huge events and learn how to deal with the audience.
Yet, "the award-winning, multi-annual favorite and light entertainment program of British TV" was at the same time a slimy parody of black people.
Henry worked in another comedy series in the '80s, where both the joke and the admiration for black British culture were made.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show was shown in 1984, and in the '90s Henry was known as, among other things, the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
For the next decade, Henry spent advertising, documentaries, TV shows and movie parts, but after his 2008 series at the BBC, LennyHenry.TV, he said to himself: "What are you going to do next, Len - now it looks like you're just treading in your seat or riding sidetracks."
Next up was the Radio 4 channel documentary series "What's So Great About..."
The first part dealt with Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It was not actually properly taught to us at school, and I think it belonged to a white middle class who wears pantyhose and has money.
That's why the Shakespeare theme raised fear in me.
All the people we interviewed on the show - Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench - said to me, "Try it.
Don't abandon the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
See the words and you understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry uttered 20 verses from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was sold.
I felt like I could do this.
It almost felt as if some part of me had been missing before, and now it was put in place.
"This is what it's all about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your verse, do a little research.
So the training process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was carried out.
The play was finally a success.
Apparently, it was expected to fail, but not quite so.
Shortly thereafter, Henry played the leading role in the Comedy of Mistakes.
Suddenly I was acting at the British National Theater and I couldn't quite believe it.
At one point, I thought, "Wow, you've changed."
Once there were technical problems in the play, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
"A little voice in my mind said to me, 'You have to do 10 minutes alone until the computer works again.' "
Instead, the director's assistant announced that the proposal would be resumed as soon as the problem has been corrected.
I walked off the stage, and part of me sighed of relief.
It's not my duty.
I can leave it to the others.
"You're part of the play, stay in character"
Henry in "Fences" play at the Duchess Theatre
Learning to play "Fences" was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes a person more resilient.
This play was also well received, so it was like a sign from the gods; "This is what you must do."
Of course, this is what Henry says in the KUMEA voice.
So I decided to stick to this.
I sincerely love this job.
I love training rooms.
However, Henry is still basically a comedian: little boys of humor constantly interrupt our conversation as he changes impressions from one impression to another.
Abstinence from Stand-up is a matter of will, for getting immediate thanks from an unknown audience seems dangerous.
If you keep thirsting for it, it could lead to a dead end.
I sometimes spend a lot of time at the Apollo theater when I feel like it, but generally speaking it no longer excites me the way it used to.
I'm gonna ask Henry if he's gonna go on another stand-up tour.
It gives me real pleasure to sit with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle and end of the whole journey, and I don't think I ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new rebirth?
I think so.
I like acting...
It's really funny.
When you play, you tell a story all the time, and that's what I like to do.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya shall establish a register of officials in order to remove "ghost workers"
Kenya has begun to establish a biometric register of officials in an attempt to remove "ghost workers" from government payroll.
Employees who did not register during the next two weeks would no longer be paid, the government announcement announced.
The government suspects that thousands of people will continue to be paid after leaving their official duties.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to eradicate corruption in the public sector after taking office in 2013.
According to an inspection carried out earlier this year, at least one million dollars was spent on the wages and other financial irregularities of "ghost workers."
The government suspects that salaries will be paid to the account even after the person has died or left his official duties, the BBC's Wanyama Chebusiri reported on the capital of Nairobi.
All officials must register themselves in the next few weeks at identification centres to ensure that their data are stored in biometric format, as reported in the Government's communication.
According to the press release, anyone who fails to do so without due cause will be removed from the payroll.
"This measure will significantly rationalise the public sector, because it will determine how many people actually work in their duties, and will also clean up the pay lists at both levels of the government, thus solving the problem of "ghost workers," says Anne Waiguru, an official of the cabinet of the Ministry of decentralisation and planning.
Seinäjoki's profit for 2015 may remain EUR 25.5 million in deficit unless the city adapts its operations and expenditure development in a tense economic climate.
On the basis of the current budgetary preparations, the annual margin is about 9.4 million in deficit.
Possible ways of improving efficiency were to compromise the scope and level of services and to purchase services, to sell assets and grants, and to increase tax and payment revenues.
The investment target of EUR 10 million is 8.5 million.
There will be no relief in the situation of municipalities.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient growth in tax revenues, rising unemployment and a 5% reduction in state participation are further undermining the prospects.
The purpose of the economic seminar is to look for new ways of balancing the economy.
The City Government agrees that savings must be made.
The ship must be translated into a strategy goal," says Kimmo Heinonen, President of the City Council.
The City Board returned the requests made to the management team for preparation.
The proposals of the City Council form the basis for the preparation of the budget at the Council's economic seminar in Fram on Monday 8 September.
After the council seminar, the budget proposal will proceed through the panel process to the City Board and the City Council.
Dozens of Turkish police are under arrest for "punishment" against the government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey as suspects of 'anti-government schemes', reports local media sources.
The police did not comment immediately.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, 14 senior police officers were arrested.
Some of the police were in contact with corruption investigations last December targeting government officials, including four government ministers.
In July several police officers were arrested in Turkey on charges of organizing a large crime unit and monitoring of telephones.
The Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was the Prime Minister at that time) said that police action was part of the planned action against him and others in power by Islamist leader Fethullah Gullen.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most Ukrainian schools opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told the waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but he said that he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The ceremonies of the first day of September were not celebrated at every school.
The whole of Ukraine does not have peace.
We must fight for peace.
All of Ukraine, the entire huge Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexander Pastukhov, a leading teacher at Slavianski School, where Yatsenyuk's daughter goes, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally return here and that children will be able to learn lessons that will benefit them in the future.
The celebrations of the first day of school include traditionally written children's shirts, balloons, and the giving of flowers to teachers.
According to Texas Perry, the taunting tweet was unauthorized.
The confirmed Twitter account of the governor of Texas, Rick Perry, sent a slanderous picture of a Democratic district attorney on Sunday evening in the middle of this hearing of allegations of abuse of power.
The tweet was later removed, followed by a new tweet in which Perry swore that he had nothing to do with the picture.
The tweet was sent illegally from my account.
"I do not accept tweet and I have deleted it," said the later publication.
Perry's backup did not respond immediately to any requests for clarification.
Although tweets were sent from Perry's confirmed Twitter account, it is unclear who published the picture.
The first tweet contained a slanderous caricature of Travis' district attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry blocked the funding of Lehmberg's office when he refused to resign, which led to a grand jury meeting in Austin this month with Perry on trial. Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
The title of Tweet was, "I don't always drive drunk, three times the permitted prom... but when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for pointing my finger."
I'm the drunkest democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office didn't lead the grand jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antionio appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry has said he is innocent and has called accusations a political plot.
His influential legal aid team has asked the judge responsible to reject the accusations and said that the law on which the governor of Texas is accused, who was the longest in office, is unclear against the Constitution.
Perry cut state aid of $7.5 million to the State's Public Inviolability Unit, which operates in Travis County and handles public sector charges when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision prompted the left-hand-based follow-up group to submit a formal complaint.
Perry's reinforced Twitter account is regularly updated and sometimes famous.
After reaching fifth place at the Iowa Election Meeting during his presidential campaign in 2012, Perry threatened to end the tie by publishing on Twitter a picture of himself jogging in the lake with the text "Here I Come, South Carolina!"
Berkeley says the housing market is "normal" again.
One of London's main developers has warned that the housing market in South-East England has "returned" to a normal level of activity.
The capital London housing has been plagued by huge demand and steep increases, while fearing a widespread credit bubble, which caused the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
On Monday, Tony Pidgley, founder and president of Berkeley, a high-level developer, said that "since the beginning of the current financial year, the market and the number of transactions have returned to normal since the peak of 2013" and added that this has enabled a "stable operating environment."
During the recession, the housing market in London went well with foreign investors making a horde of efforts to reach the capital city.
According to the land register, housing prices in the city rose by 18.5% in the previous year alone, thus clearly exceeding the average for England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
The average selling prices of private, affordable and student buildings in Berkeley rose by around one fifth in the previous year, reaching an increase of GBP 423 000 by the end of April.
However, the strengthened pound has made London's properties less attractive in recent months - some of the interest has also been influenced by new property tax laws and political rhetoric about a possible "manorage tax" before the general elections in May.
The London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage report, which reported more stringent lending provisions, would lead to lower market growth both in terms of sales volumes and prices of real estate in the second half of the year.
Recent data from the Bank of England showed on Monday that the number of approved loans fell in July, suggesting a cooling housing market.
The real estate agent Hamptons International has lowered its forecast for 2015 from London real estate prices by 3%, as the price index measuring the opinion of housing owners has already begun to weaken.
The number of transactions made in the most expensive areas of London in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has fallen by a quarter to one year ago," says real estate agent WA Ellis.
However, the demand for homes in the capital is a blessing to Berkeley, who increased the income from the properties sold to more than GBP 2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that "the demand for a well-designed product of the right type at its best locations has remained stable and therefore sales have remained high'.
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year before April, almost one third more than at the time of the peak before the economic crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profits increased by 40 per cent to GBP 380 million one year ago and turnover increased by 18 per cent to GBP 1.6 billion.
On Monday, before the annual meeting of the company, Pidgley explained that Berkeley's earnings for the year were in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the pre-tax profit for the whole year is GBP 450 million.
Berkeley's share sold steadily on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon at £23.96.
The hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence's naked photos into the net.
Jennifer Lawrence is arriving at the 85th annual Academy Awards.
A hacker who claims to have a hundred other star photos leaked the naked photos of Oscar actor Jennifer Lawrence online.
The representative of the star star hunger confirmed that the images were genuine and condemned the hacker for "brave invasion of privacy."
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes Jennifer Lawrence's stolen photos will be charged.
The images originally released on the 4chan release page had apparently fallen into the wrong hands due to the weakness of Apple's iCloud recording system. The list of hundreds of other Hacked Stars is claimed to have dozens of other female stars, as reported by Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed.
It is not known how much of the photos are authentic, although Scott Pilgrim versus World star Winstead condemned hacking on Twitter.
"To those who are watching pictures of my and my husband's home in privacy years ago: I hope you feel good," Winstead tweeted.
However, Victoria Justice of the Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and "Victorious" series denied the authenticity of the photos and tweeted that "these so-called naked pictures of me are WRONG, don't you understand?"
Let me put an end to this right away.
BuzzFeedin announced late Sunday that the pop star Ariana Grande's representative forbade the authenticity of the pictures of the star.
Only our grip on Howard Jacobson's commendable new novel about love and the letter "J"
They dissolved, it represented the best thing that ever happened, and gradually they separated from each other like a cardboard box left out in the rain.
Only occasionally did she hear from the woman that she was too serious, too laborious, intense, detached, and perhaps also a little thorny.
That's when he waved his hand.
He recognized the thorny one.
Yeah, he was spiked, like a hedgehog.
The latest victim of his spikes had been in the early stages of a relationship that had, however, been promising; it seemed that this relationship could have eased his lonely boredom, and it might have brought even some substance into his life.
Ailinn Solomons had untamed hair and she was a delicately delicate beauty with a joyous heart, from the northern village, which was even harsher and farther away from everything than Port Reuben.
He had come south with an older traveling companion whom Kevern assumed to be his aunt. Aunt had inherited a house in a damp but paradise valley, and the valley was appropriately called Paradise Valley.
No one lived in the house for years.
The pipes leaked, all the bathrooms had spiders, the snails had left their marks on the windows, keeping the whole place their own, the garden grew weeds that resembled giant cabbage heads.
The cabin was like a children's fairy tale, at the same time threatening and magical, a garden full of secrets.
As told by the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is nominated for the Booker Literature Prize in 2014.
Candidates will be published next week
Kevern had sat hand in hand with Ailinni on a broken terrace chair in the middle of a long hay, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both of them listening distractedly to a reception through which the whole country heard soothing music and soothing news, when Ailinn's crossed, sun-tanned feet brought to Kevern's mind a song that had been sung by a long time ago by a forgotten black performer and his father had often listened to the cottage blinds down.
Your leg's too big.
Such songs were basically too aggressive and no longer played on the receiver.
They were not banned - nothing was actually banned - they just weren't played anymore.
They wanted to be left in oblivion, just like the word itself.
Public opinion did what laws and proclamation had not achieved: just as in literature people chose to read heroes' memoirs, cookbooks and romances, in music they prefer ballads.
At the end of the day, Kevern began to pluck a fictional piano and sing serenad to Ailinni's big legs with an insolently comatose voice.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"It was the famous song of Jazz Pianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, while naturally lifting two fingers in front of his mouth.
His father had always done this before the letter "J" could escape his lips.
It had begun as a game between him and Dad when he was little.
His father told me he played the same game with his own father.
If you let out the word that starts with "J," and you didn't remember to put two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn't very funny then, and it wasn't funny now.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard such a thing.
Jazz wasn't exactly banned either. It wasn't just played.
The improvisation wasn't in style anymore.
There was only room in life for one word if.
At the start of the song, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same thing had happened to snitchy.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was the wit of music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior by the age of ten, he had become familiar with jazz music through his father's semi-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailin that Fats Waller was black.
Given Ailinni's age, it was likely that she did not remember the time when the popular singers were not black.
Again, there was no need for laws or coercion.
The obedient society meant that each part of it accepted with gratitude - grateful that they were as saved with happiness - the principle that each group did natural things to it.
Because of their temperament and physical characteristics, people with African Caribbean roots are best suited to entertain and athlete, so they sang and ran.
Originally, those from the Indian continent were like natural talents with electrical equipment, so their job was to make sure that each family had a functional telephone that was used to handle matters.
Those remaining in the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke plates.
When it happened, if it came true, those from the Persian Gulf and the Middle East whose grandparents had not fled quickly in fear of being accused of blazing flames and fearing that the flames would reach them next, opened restaurants serving labneh yogurt and smoking a pipe of water, and continued to live with the eyes created and depressed with boredom.
Let each man act according to his gifts.
Ailinn had only heard ballads, and it was hard for her to understand how the hurtful words Kevern just sang could ever have been put on in music.
Through music, love was manifested.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe for the bigfoot.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created an illusion of safety.
No word would pass through the soundproofing of giant cabbage leaves.
She still didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was gonna say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to raise two fingers with Ailinni.
Ailinn thought he was weird already.
"Dad thought it was funny," he said instead.
Ailinn shook her head in disbelief, and her hair covered Kevern's field of vision.
Nothing more to see in the world than Ailin's huge black hairbrush.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"If you say so," he said, but he didn't sound convinced.
But it doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
Ailinn seemed genuinely confused.
Are my legs that big?
He looked again.
Your legs aren't exactly big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you" but it was still too early for that.
"I find you attractive because of your thick ankles," he tried to make things right.
I'm twisted in that sense.
This didn't help.
He wanted it to sound like fun.
Often, when he wanted to have fun, the effect was quite different because, like his father, he lacked the convincing charm to control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite his gentle eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and rose from her terrace chair and poured the receiver and spilled the wine they had just drank.
Even the wine was made of elderflowers, so he could not use the cause of the collision.
In his nervousness, he seemed to shake like palm leaves in a storm.
"And your thick head is what twistedly attracts me to you," he said...
Except I don't feel like it.
Kevern felt sorry for Ailinn, both for his own, unnecessary cruel words and for the fear that appeared in her eyes at the moment that Ailinn decided to stand up to her.
Did Ailinn think she was gonna hit you?
He had never told Kevern about life in the cold northern archipelago where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that it had basically been like life here.
The same huge, icy ocean that waved against them.
The same confused men, though even paler and devilish than their smuggler and breaker grandparents, walked from pub to pub, ready to beat every woman who dared to resist or tease them.
Thick head?
He'd see a thick fist if he wasn't careful!
Imuta first - kissing had become the most common word for erotic encounters between man and woman; the receiver's pumping meaningless love ballads - first suction and then attack.
Kevern felt that that was too much, for sucking itself was already hostile.
Ailinn Solomons' body language urged her to leave.
He pulled himself out of the terrace chair like an old man.
Ailinn also felt exhausted, but he was surprised by the depth of Kevern's grief.
This wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn watched him go, just as his traveling companion watched Kevern go through the window upstairs - the man who was the cause of his heavy life.
Adam leaving the garden, he wondered.
He felt pity for Kevern and the men in general, even though some of them had raised their hands against him to strike.
A man who turned his back, bowed, shamed, defeated with all the will to fight - why did he feel that the vision was so familiar to him, even though he did not remember that he would have seen such things once before this moment?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, she looked at her feet.
A few years before the event just described, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old scientist, Esme Nussbaum, who worked in a private institution measuring the Mind in Ofnow, made a short study of the continuation of small and medium-hard violence in the areas of the country where the reduction, or even the end of violence, was most likely taking into account the money and energy used to eradicate it.
"Many things have already been accomplished and much remains to be done," he wrote, "to compensate for the natural aggression of the people who fought for thousands of years and most often won, especially in those abandoned and isolated places where, despite the church towers crossing hedges, human mildness has rarely been known in the ages.
Some things, however, cannot be completely eliminated.
The higher the tower, the lower the desires it brings.
The people are weeping among sentimental ballads, devouring stories of conquered adversities and swearing in the name of virtues of married and family life, but at the same time old-fashioned cruelty keeps both rural communities and urban areas together, and there is evidence of a new, more evil-minded quarrel in homes, workplaces, our streets and even playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to dramatize," his director commented after reading the full report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum put her eyes on the ground.
And I have to ask you, are you an atheist?
"I believe I don't have to answer that," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme continued to plead his right not to answer personal questions.
Feminist?
Once again, silence.
"I'm not asking," Luther Rabinowitz said, "because I'm against atheism, lesbianism and feminism.
There is no prejudice in this workplace.
We are servants of an open - minded society.
Although a certain type of hypersensitivity is totally acceptable and respectable in itself, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, things you just presented to me.
Clearly, you have something against the church - and what you call cruelty or malice, others usually call inherent energy and physical strength.
Saying what happened, if it happened, as if it had happened yesterday, if it had happened at all, will destroy the country's fundamental vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz was talking.
Behind Rabinowitz's head, the flamingon pink LED light proclaimed an instruction that Ofnow had already distributed to the country for a quarter or more of the previous century.
Smile for your neighbor, value your partner, listen to the ballads, go to the musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence and the word sung is better than written, but nothing conquers love.
"I understand very well what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum replied in a quiet voice when she was sure that her director had finished, "and I just want to say that we are not as effectively healed as we think we are.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will find ourselves repeating the same mistakes that originally led to SOHEN, what happened, IF IT HAPPENED.
True, this time we will not shed our hatred and distrust of others.
Luther Rabinowitz used his fingers to form a pyramid.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "in describing what our grandparents might have done or not done as 'false mistakes'.
You also go too far when you say they poured out their 'hate and distrust of others'.
A person in your position should not have to remind you that when it comes to understanding the past or defending the present, we are not talking about 'us' or 'them'.
There was no "us" or "others."
It was a time of chaos, that's all we know about it.
"If we are quite honest, in that chaos," Esme ventured to continue, "no group of society can say that they have behaved well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done was done, be it good or bad.
It was then.
We do not need to talk about this any further - we agree on this.
And just as it is unnecessary to make accusations, there is no need to make corrections, whether they are justified or not, and even if there is a way to do them.
But what does the past exist for if you don't learn from it --
The past exists so that we can forget it.
If I may add one more thing...
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'll go through your report," he said, and indicated that it was time for Esmen to leave.
The next day, as he went to work as usual, he was hit by a motorcycle rider on the sidewalk, whose driving was described by passersby as "evil-minded and furious."
Coincidences happen.
Lesotho's army denies that they planned the attack; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Lesotho's army officials have denied that they staged an attack on the government and said that they acted against a police officer suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country saying that the army had surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital city of Maseru.
A head of state traveled with his family to a neighbouring South Africa after telling him that he was threatened with death.
Major Ntlele Ntoi, a representative of the army, denied the attack and said that the army thus responded to a threat from "political fanatics." Police have been said to have tried to arm fanatics.
"Lesotho's armed forces took action after receiving a number of intelligence reports that certain police forces are trying to arm young party fanatics when they are ready to cause problems," he told the Voice of America news agency.
According to Clayson Monyela, President of the South African Government, military action seemed to be a revolutionary attempt.
"Although no party has claimed to have overturned the government by force, the actions of thelesotho armed forces appear in every way to match the signs of the revolutionary attempt," he says.
According to the officials of thelesotho army, the soldiers return to their barracks on Sunday, and there was a calm atmosphere in the capital.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing is in charge of the government in the absence of Thabane.
Thabane says he believes that he is the target of action because he has tried to fight corruption.
There have been tensions in Lesotho since June when Thabane suspended Parliamentary sessions due to the disagreements of the great coalition government.
He thus denies that he was undermining the authority of the government, even though it is claimed otherwise.
Kauppalehti: Microsoft establishes a data centre in Uusimaa
Microsoft has established a large data centre in Uusimaa, where the company refuses to specify its location.
In a communication to Microsoft's media, the company states that it does not indicate the location of all its data centers for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the center is fully equipped and connected to the network.
For Microsoft, it is an investment of several hundred million dollars.
In public, Oulu or Kajaani had previously been betting on the center's site.
Microsoft will completely shut down its Oulu office, which will take the job away from about 500 people.
In total, Microsoft has announced a maximum of 1 050 redundancies in Finland.
Microsoft Communications Director Camilla Lindfors tells STT that the company does not comment on how many staff the new data centre employs.
On Monday, about setting up a data center in Uusimaa, the Kauppalehti told us.
He's being charged with assaulting a girl in a traffic jury.

Gordon Stewart is charged with hitting a girl at a crossroads in Pittenween, Eastern Neuk.
According to the prosecutors, Stewart drove his Audi Q3 car carelessly and injured her.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied the charges at Dundee Sheriff's Session.
Sheriff Charles Macair QC ordered the trial to be held in January.
Four tips for better underwater images and videos
If you want to take pictures or video underwater, you have several different device options to choose from.
The cheapest option is a waterproof, compact point-and-shoot camera, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both cost about $300.
I personally took these pictures at the family feast using several different cameras, each of which cost less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules that you should follow.
Always double-check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery and other parts of the camera are closed waterproofly.
In addition, set camera description settings to match the images or video to be taken.
Some cameras or combinations of the camera and video camera have a set that optimises the conditions under water.
Plus... before you jump into the water, make sure how deep your device can get.
Some cameras can only withstand the depth of 5 feet, others can withstand the depth of up to 50-60 feet.
Get to know both ordinary and waterproof models in our shopping guide and digital camera reviews.
Take several pictures - many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD display that allows you to form a picture, while action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see it underwater, and the image composition can either succeed or fail.
So take several photos.
If your camera also allows forking, which means taking multiple images at once with different settings, use this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
Light decreases significantly deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface while shooting in a swimming pool, lake or sea.
This will also give you more colors in your pictures; the deeper you go, the less colors you see.
Try to get close to the target you're shooting.
This is important advice when filming on land, but even more important under water, because light conditions are scarce.
It is very important when an action camera is used: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of view, which means that the photographer must be close to the target to fill the entire picture with frames.
China will not allow Hong Kong to choose its leaders - protesters swear revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided that Hong Kong voters should not select candidates for the 2017 elections despite the growing lack of calm that demands democratic reform.
The decision is likely to spark the long awaited protests of the Hong Kong business block after activists start to plan and implement protests only hours after the decision has been published.
In practice, the decision of the Chinese People's Congress gives the Communists the power to eradicate all candidates who disobey Beijing.
"This was to be expected, but it is still infuriating," says Chairman of the Democratic Party, legislator Emily Lau.
This isn't what Beijing promised.
They've lied to the Hong Kong people.
It is clear that we are dealing with an autocratic regime.
Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Congress Committee, defended the Chinese regime, saying that it would be too "chaotic' to stand as a general candidate for the election of the Hong Kong leader.
Since 1997, when Great Britain handed Hong Kong over to China, Beijing promised the inhabitants of the region that it would be allowed to choose its own leader from 2017 onwards.
According to the Chinese leaders, the decision on Sunday was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but it also makes it clear that China wants to control the electoral process strictly through the nomination committee, which is managed by Beijing.
Under the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be accepted.
During the summer before the decision, some of the biggest and most prominent protests in the region took place in Hong Kong for years.
The campaign to defend democracy was largely driven by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organisers have threatened to block the business block if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong a genuine universal right to vote.
On Sunday night, only hours after the decision was published, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong's main government buildings.
At the protest, the organizers announced that the movement would move into a new era of civil disobedience and that they would be producing protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they evidently did not give details, fearing that this would lead to problems with the authorities.
In a press release published online, organizers said that the movement "considers Occupy Central as the last resort to be introduced only if there is no hope of dialogue and there is no other way" .
We are very sorry to announce that today's last opportunity for dialogue has failed and that the invasion of the centre will take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday security measures were tight near the main government buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, unrest feeds many people's feelings that residents are slowly losing control of their city.
The wave from the continent has created competition for products and services.
There is also fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are disappearing under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some have criticised the Occupy Central movement because its expressions threaten Hong Kong's lifeblood - the business world.
"The protest they are talking about can lead to major financial losses, depending on how many people participate in it and how long it lasts," says Regina Ip, legislator, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to see Hong Kong slip out of our grasp.
Such an image would be bad for investing.
There are also stories in the Chinese state media that Hong Kong's democratic activists are the minions of the revolutionary Western powers'.
This summer, activists held an informal referendum on voting rights involving 780 000 people - more than one fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July tens of thousands participated in one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the region.
U.S. Prom tradition hits British universities: new students with private jets
We are thrilled to respond to the demand by setting up Britain's first luxury class of travel for today's students.
In addition to a private plane, the company also offers other means of transport such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 so that the customer can ensure the most memorable arrival at the university.
Stewart says there's also a security aspect to the service.
The service is the best possible option for students who would otherwise drag their property across the country in loaded cars.
When this is combined with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to offer today's students the easiest and high-quality transport to the university.
According to the company representative, no reservations have yet been received because the service has only just been established, but added that "students will start making orders in the next few weeks."
The company believes that there is a demand for the service, although most students pay £9,000 in tuition fees.
Today's students are very different from the students who started their studies 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now it is more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is the right way to do it.
However, a national student organisation criticises a service that is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, vice-president of the organisation's higher education section, "this service plan seems to be very far from the life of the student majority."
Many of their studies begin this month with a shocking level of living costs when the financial aid available in the form of loans and scholarships is lagging behind the huge increase in basic living costs, and it is only next that we can start to wonder where thousands could be found to be used for such a simple matter as coming to campus.

Real estate agents removed the sales photo of the house on sale in Suffolk when they discovered that a big pig lies in the house's living room.
A single bedroom house with a price of £120,000 is located along a private road in Ipswich.

Basketball: Fans' encouragement almost too much: Sasu Salin almost fainted into the field
Basketball Sasu Salin was the embodiment of Finland's victory today.
He was able to forget his heart black U.S. game and beat the blood of the second half of Ukraine with his sobering solutions.
But Salin transferred all credit to the wolf fans and did it in style:
I almost fainted at the end of the field. That encouragement was so awesome.
In his eyes, he was blurry, he couldn't help it.
That noise and the white public ocean was almost too much for me.
The power moments in the hall contained nine surfaces at a rapid pace, ball-breakings, disks, and scrambling everywhere that happened.
I don't know how it happened, but I got into a flow mode where everything worked out.
They just come from somewhere sometimes, now they're in an incredibly important place, Sasu was glowing.
That's my role.
To do all that.
Now it was great to see that others got caught up in the plot.
It grabbed the whole gang.
The hall is the team's joy pill and spirit creator, so no wonder his example raised the whole team to a flight that was too much for the big and rough five of Ukraine.
Finland in the World Cup after a 32-year break: The last one left me with an outrageous judge game.
Heikki Montonen (right) carrying the bag was the main coach of Finland at the 1982 Argentina World Cup.
It has been 32 years since the Finnish men's volleyball team last played in the World Cup finals.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was Finland's second coach and current player agent Jouni Parkkali as a universal player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament as yesterday's day: it was a burning match against France in the initial section.
"In the ball game, the judge game was flagrant," Kosonen recalled.
We had already won, and both teams had already set themselves on the backline.
All of a sudden, the game went on.
We lost it 2-3, and then the shit went crazy more," said Parkkali.
Finland played under the command of Head Coach Heikki Montonen and eventually ranked 17th.
Now Finland is again among the world's champions as Poland's World Cup kicks off this Saturday.
Many things have changed dramatically in international volleyball in 32 years.
Players' power values are about the same as before, but there is now more quality and skill.
The average lengths of players have also increased.
The game is faster than ever," thought Parkkali.
But what will happen in Poland?
The Finnish player material has expanded and the burden can be shared.
I expect Finland to be able to continue from the initial section.
Then it can get tough," says Kosonen.
Seppo Cricket
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were in a winning match against Tunisia.
Current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a global player at the World Cup tournament.
Let's hope this is the 17th place we're working on.

The Finns rescued Cita from the mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all thanks"
When Merethe Mikkelsen of Norway and his dog got into trouble in the mountains on Thursday, Antti and Tuomo Soini offered valiant help.
On the weekend Mikkelsen was looking for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank his helpers once more.
Mikkelsen told me in a public Facebook update that a Cita dog with him in the mountains on Thursday hurt his paw.
The injured dog could no longer walk in steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to lure and drag it a little further, but its legs didn't just carry it, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, there was no help from the police, from a nearby hotel or from passersby.
By the end of the night, things were starting to look threatening.
Fortunately, there were two hikers who were willing to help: Antti Soini of Tampere and his father Tuomo.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway on the Galdhøpiggen and headed to their camp spot when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm compared to the situation.
We offered to help her with the dog," Antti Soini tells her message to the Evening Words.
Soon a German man came along with a hiking mattress.
From the mattress to Cita, they got the kind of gurneys that the injured dog was attached to.
The German man arrived shortly after us when we thought about what to do with the dog and carried the dog down the slope for a while," says Soini.

The dog was carried down by a hiking mattress.
According to Soin, the performance was not physically heavy, but it was slow to carry on difficult terrain.
After about an hour and a half, however, Cita was happily brought down.
After what happened, Mikkelsen was still on Facebook looking for "international heroes" so he could thank them once more.
The soin answered him on Sunday, but apparently the German man is still unreachable.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen is happy.
If they hadn't helped me, we might not have come back.
I'd like to find these people because I feel like I didn't thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all praise and honor, and I am eternally grateful to them.
On the night against Monday, the Soins were already on their way home.
Mikkelsen said they'd had a happy catch-up: "Cita's feeling better already!"

Genetic abnormalities are often misdiagnosed
For years, a British woman feared death because of a misdiagnostic diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers believed most of his youth that he had only a few years left to live because he had been diagnosed with another disease.
He actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), which means a series of hereditary diseases that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
According to Charity CMT UK, misdiagnosis is a common problem in the case of CMTs because so little is known about them.
It is estimated that around 23 000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which causes symptoms in motorism, such as muscle weakness, difficult walking and toe curls.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and it is incurable and progressive, which means that symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he thought he had Friedreich's Ataxia (FA) with a very poor survival rate.
Rodgers believed he was going to be in a wheelchair before he turned 18 and died before he reached the age of 30.
Today, a 51-year-old mother of two says, "When I was a kid, I knew I couldn't do the same things as everyone else.
I fell every day, and it took me longer than anyone else.
I was never able to skate or skate with other children, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently than others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he had several Achilles tendon surgeries to straighten his legs. When the doctor left the room, he quickly looked at his research papers saying that he was suffering from FA disease.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home I checked the medical records in the library and wrote to the FA association," he says.
When they gave me information, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I was going to be in a wheelchair by the age of 18 and would die before I turned 25, and then I would slowly lose my full capacity.
I went through this by myself and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers reports that by the age of 17 he found that his walk had not deteriorated as much as he thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said, "Dear girl, I don't think you have this disease because otherwise you'd already be in a wheelchair."
I think you're suffering from something far less dangerous.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
"When I was explained what CMT is, I thought I'd been lucky," he says.
Charity CMT UK organizes the CMT month to pay attention to the disease.
A hundred immigrants were found in a coal cart in Macedonia
The Macedonian authorities have found more than 100 illegal immigrants on a coal-transported train," said the Ministry of the Interior on Monday.
Most of the stowaways were Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
The immigrants were found late Sunday in Veles, Central Macedonia.
It was hard to communicate with most of them.
They didn't know where they were, where they came from and where they're going," said Ivo Koteski, publicist at the Ministry of the Interior.
According to the police, immigrants had paid about EUR 3 000 each to get to Greece, and another EUR 800-900 to get to Serbia.
Illegal immigrants pass through Macedonia with a few million inhabitants on their way to Western Europe.
Three million people have already fled the bloody civil war in Syria.

Russia's Space Test Failed - Geckos sent on a sex trip died
The five little geckos sent to space by Russia have died, says Roscosmos in a press release from the Russian Federation Space Agency.
The Gekos travelled on a Foton-M4 satellite for over a month and a half.
The satellite returned to the country on Monday morning in Finland time.
The purpose of the experiment was to study the reproductive performance and use of geckos in weightless conditions.
One male gecko and four females took part in the experiment.
Although the experiment sounds strange, it was meant to be serious.
For example, little is known about the effects of weightlessness on the development of gecko eggs.
Through the effects on geckos, anticipating the effects of zero weight on a person while staying in a space similar to longer periods of time is an illustration of New Statesman in July.
Roscosmos says the time of the geckos' death and the cause or causes of their death will be determined.
According to the news agency Interfax, passengers crossed into "sex gigs" froze.
Surprisingly, the fruit flies that traveled with the same Foton-M4 survived the trip, and they also grew up.
France arrested a terrorist suspect at Nice Airport
France arrested a man suspected of terrorism at Nice airport on Saturday.
A 22-year-old male is suspected of recruiting a jihadist group in Syria.
The French authorities informed the Commission on Sunday.
The authorities were able to track him after he had lured a 16-year-old girl into Syria with money.
The girl was to fly to Turkey and then cross the Syrian border.
The airline did not believe the girl's explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but they alerted the authorities.
The authorities contacted her father, who was completely unaware of her daughter's intentions and told the authorities that her family had no family in Turkey.
According to the authorities, he is from Chechnya, but he now lives in France.
The French intelligence authorities had followed the man's actions earlier.
In France, the authorities have been concerned that radicalising young people who have attracted Iraq or Syria to wars also constitute a security risk for France.
The authorities estimate that around 800 French citizens or those enrolled in France during the last conflict have travelled to Syria, returned there or are planning to go to Syria.
Koponen: We have a good chance of winning
The hopes of the basketball team for a follow-up are at stake when Finland meets Ukraine today in its second match at the World Cup.
If the opening loss for the United States had been expected, Ukraine will again be one of the countries from which Finland should take the necessary profits for the successor place.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I think we have a good chance of winning, Petteri Koponen predicts.
On Saturday, Ukraine defeated the Dominican Republic in its first match 72-62.
The team is coached by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, under the command of Ukraine playing aggressive basketball.
The key player in Ukraine is Gambler Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a world champion of 100 metres three years ago.
Against the Dominican Republic, Jeter threw 16 points.
Pooh Jeter quick guy, but we've played against that kind of thing before and we need to get our standard defense in order," Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland would play better than yesterday's defeat for the United States.
We need to find our own strengths again.
I can assure you there will be a normal wolf pack in the field," Möttölä said.
The alleged naked images of the Hollywood stars are spreading online - some are confirmed to be genuine
On the Internet, a number of naked images are spreading that claim to represent well-known public figures.
Among other things, actress Jennifer Lawrence has been the victim of a "sleeping campaign."
Entertainment site TMZ has published an angry comment from Lawrence's representatives that seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a blatant violation of privacy.
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes Jennifer Lawrence's stolen photos (on the Internet) will be prosecuted, the representatives will be threatened.
According to TMZ, the actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the photos of her spread are genuine.
She had taken these pictures years ago with her husband.
When I know that those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what awkward effort was made to do this.
I feel sympathy for everyone who got hacked, he writes by the site.
Instead, actress Victoria Justice calls photos of her own name fake.
Genuine or fake naked pictures are also on the move, at least from Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
Honka goalie criticized his own: "They don't work hard enough to get out of here."
Football Club FC Honka is currently in the last place in the league.
The comments made by goalie Walter Vitala after the VPS match on Sunday are a good illustration of the confusion of the club's current situation.
I haven't had a goalie coach in four months.
But you have to adapt to everything," Viitala said after the battle ended with a defeat of one to two.
Honka made a lot of defense-headed mistakes in the match, especially during the first half.
Viitala, the goalie, was not pleased with the bad defense game.
Player traffic has been busy in Honga this summer, which is why the defenders in front of Viitola have also changed rapidly.
With the roulette, many young players have also had opportunities that they might not even deserve.
"Some people don't work hard enough to get out of here someday," Viitala wasted a lot of money without naming any single player.
Shefki Kuqi, head coach of Honga, agreed somewhat with Vitala.
"I told certain players after the game that if you come to practice and games to have fun and think you're a betting league player and you don't have to work, you're probably on the wrong team," Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of kids time to play.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of it, it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also pointed out that players cannot expect immediate success as players change their players constantly.
This season has not had the same composition twice in a row.
Especially in the defense head, there's been a change in the crowd.
That is the main reason why we are in this position," Kuqi said.
After the VPS loss, Honka is a serial jumbo, tied to the second last TPS.
There are still seven laps left in the betting league, so the espoos still have time to avoid falling to One.
I've never dropped a team, and I'm not gonna drop it now.
We're definitely not gonna fall out of this series," goalie Viitala made a scene.
Lars von Trier making a TV series after decades of break

Angle of wolves howling: How can a fan increase be explained?
I was feeling great today.
This was said by basketball player Sakari Pehkonen in 1995, after Finland played at the European Championship final tournament against France at the Marouss Ball Hall in Athens.
Puffon didn't exaggerate.
I remember the game when I was there.
So were the hundreds of Finns who shouted for 20,000 viewers, or noisy halls.
I wonder what Pehkonen would have said 19 years later after the Finland-Ukraine World Cup match?
In Bilbao, there are eighty-fold of Finnish fans.
The European Championship 1995 was a search time for Finnish basketball.
The men cleared their way to the final tournament by winning a Russian qualifying match at the Helsinki Sports Centre.
That victory opened the doors to the cream of Europe.
Everything looked good.
There were promising kids like Hanno Möttölä.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann put Möttölä on the final tournament team.
A solution that many disagreed with.
Now you can say that Dettmann was a wise man from far away, even though not everything went according to the script.
After Athens, the basketball team dived deep.
A total of over 100 Finns were reported to be present at the Athens Games.
It included journalists, players' relatives, Finnish basketball coaches and some fans.
Bilbao also has journalists, relatives and coaches, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to incomprehensible proportions.
I don't think anyone can tell the exact number of Finnish competitions.
Estimates have moved between 7,500 and 10,000.
Whatever the number between them is, it's quite incomprehensible.
This is explaining to sports sociologists.
In a global global economy, companies move across borders.
There is still an opportunity in sport to look at how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can visit our girls and boys to see how they thrive in the world," says Professor Hannu Itkonen of Sports Sociology.
Certainly there are Finns in both Spain and the volleyball World Cup in Poland who are looking for experience.
We've had a lot of experience together.
It still doesn't explain everything.
You have to have a lot of attraction in sports yourself.
Itkonen brings sport into popular culture.
It's a lower threshold for going to sports competitions than Berlin to see art.
But without success, the masses will not be able to move.
Let's go back to 1995.
At that time, head coach Dettmann challenged the basketball union and even players to throw themselves into top sports professionally.
It took almost ten years.
Then the direction changed and the national team action was put on the pedestal.
The volleyball people made the same move a little earlier.
Now both enjoy the fruits of the work.
As Itkonen says, both species have managed to produce their top sports, where the sacred Trinity works: sports-media sponsors.
Then the audience will also be interested.
And the media has taught us what this carnivalistic support is, Itkonen reminds us.
Can the ball sports also transfer this massive interest to home series?
On average, basketball and volleyball are played for hundreds or just over a thousand viewers.
Itkonen thinks the question is good and does not necessarily give an answer that promises very good species.
Another school believes that interest is shifting.
The other one is the one who doesn't want the sweet to be full.
This group is ready for an experience trip to the World Cup, but in their basic thinking domestic series are not of dual interest.
It's a challenge for the companions in the middle of the drug.
Confirming Bottas property - nearly 1.5 hectares by the lake
Nastola will reward the Formula Driver at Valtteri Bottas beach house.
The municipal council unanimously approved the transfer of the 1.4 ha plot at its meeting on Monday.
In the future, a free-time apartment will arise on the property.
Nastola has been monitoring the success of Bottas since the time of his charting.
He is seen as a good ambassador to market Lahti, Lahti and Nastola.
The gift plot is located in Koiskala, on the shore of Kärkjärvi.
It is owned by the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate transaction.
There are seven demolition buildings in the area, of which the municipality will tear down six at the expense of the end of this year.
Bottas achieved Formula 1 in the Belgian sectional this year.
He's at World Championship in fifth grade.
Bottas is a native native of Nastola and has lived his childhood in Villävuotta.
He lives in England now, but he goes to Nastola every time he's free of the formulas.
Bottas has visited secondary schools and youth facilities.
Designer smart clothes are coming, but hardly for the poor.
It will present and test them at the current U.S. Open tennis competition in New York.
Ralph Lauren's smart shirts are tested by ball players, but also by amateur Marcus Giron, one of the top university players.
According to him, the shirt helps him to follow his own development and to regulate his recovery.
The shirt is woven with silver sensors that transmit the information to and from the mound in the shirt to the smartphone or tablet computer.
Sensors measure heart rate, breath rhythm, stress and steps.
Before throwing the shirt into the washing machine, the mokula, which is a central unit, is removed.
The Fashion House has not told us the exact time to start selling the shirt, nor has it even implied its price," Tech Times reports.
Raph Lauren is not the only company that invests in smart clothing.
The Californian Athos has brought a smart shirt and shorts for sale.
They measure heart rate, breathing and muscle work.
Clothes cost $100 apiece and the required thumb - size central unit costs $200.
The technology was also written by the Red Orbs.
Smart way to save on textbooks
The cost of university books in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so Matt Schroeder, who soon began his second year of study, came up with a smart way to save on costs.
He developed a system in which students of later classes borrow their books for nominal remuneration instead of selling them immediately.
"My mathematics book would normally have cost $180; I paid $10 to use it for the entire semester, and I turned to a sandwich," says 19-year-old Schroeder, studying at Covenant College, Georgia.
Schroeder says that his books last semester would normally have cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the university board, the average student spends over $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many ways of reducing these costs.
Students increasingly end up using online shops and creative approaches such as Schroeder's idea.
More and more students rent textbooks so that they can use the book throughout the semester and pay far less for it than students who buy the book.
According to Neebo Inc., which runs over 250 campus bookstore stores, the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Statistics in this field reveal that about one quarter of books from university booksellers were rental books during the past spring," says Trevor Meyer, President of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus bookshops.
Here are the simplest ways to save money.
Online shops
In online stores, a new book can only be obtained by a third of the price it would pay at a campus bookstore.
Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler's ninth edition of "Calculus" is the recommended price of nearly $290, but a book from Chegg.com speciality books online is available at $239.99.
Buy When Used
Used books are a good option if the reader is not disturbed by others' notes and worn appearance.
For example, the Calculus book can be used at Chegg.com online store for $93.49.
Brigham Young University's final year student Matt Casaday, 25 years old, reports that he bought the book "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" at Amazon.com for only $0.42.
The new book would have cost $48.
The director of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls School Ingrid Bracey and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if previous editions can be used in the course.
Sometimes the reforms of the new edition are not relevant to teaching.
In this case, the old edition can only be found for a fraction of the price that should be paid for the new edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon book stores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Renting
You should consider renting textbooks if you take good care of them, remember to return them and do not need them after completing your course.
By renting, you can save over 80 percent of the price of a new book.
For example, renting the Calculus book for the entire term costs about $20.
Check out the rules of the rental company, such as notes, highlighter use and wear charges.
The renter, be careful: if you forget to return the book, the delay fee may be higher than the book purchase price.
E-books
Getting e-books instead of ordinary paperwork can also be a question.
These books are sometimes rented and paid for access to the e-book to its holder, such as Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
The Chegg store buys the Calculus book as an e-book for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, many literature students save the most because many classics can now be downloaded free of charge, while science and technology books can be very expensive.
It pays to compare different sellers, whatever option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon start at Pepperdine Law School, recommends using the book ISBN number to determine the price, because it can make sure that you are looking for the right book.
Before ordering online, make sure the book is in storage," says Gault.
He himself learned this the hard way.
The delivery of the book he bought was frozen for four weeks, and he finally had to obtain the book at full cost at the university bookstore.

Nearly twice the number of people killed in fires compared to last year
This year almost twice as many people have died in fires as in last year.
According to the media monitoring of the Finnish National Rescue Association (Spek), 55 people have already died in 49 fires.
During the corresponding period last year there were 31 deaths from fire.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
There have been 11 people over 65 years old.
According to the organisation's fire death statistics, the worst situation was last in 2009, when 64 people had died from fires by the end of August.
Most of the deaths occur in apartments.
There have been 17 fire deaths in apartments, 21 in detached houses and seven in terraced houses and other small houses.
Spek reminds me of a repeat of home fire safety.
At least all the smoke detectors in the home should be ensured, according to Mr. Spek.
In addition, all should check that the start-up fire-fighting equipment is readily available.
There must also be an unhindered exit route from all homes.
Children should also be informed of the electrical equipment they are allowed to use when they are alone at home.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
The opponents of the NATO Summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday hundreds gathered in the city center of Newport on an anti - NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events this weekend and spoke with protestors who had even arrived from Belgium.
Youngsters were rescued by air from the Australian Blue Mountains
TWO teenage hikers were raised to safety after being stuck overnight in the Blue Mountains of the New South Wales region of Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went hiking after noon on Sunday to Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
The family became concerned about young people who had not returned home and called the police at eight o'clock in the evening.
A search party of local police and helpers was sent to search for young people, and the two were found about 11:00 near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had hurt her knee, and the man had fallen and smashed his head.
The cops spent the night with a couple, and they were raised to safety on Monday morning.
The hikers were taken by ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdrew from Luhansk Airport
Ukraine's troops have withdrawn from Luhansk Airport.
According to the Ukrainian army, the soldiers were ordered to retreat.
According to Ukraine, the paratroopers have been vehemently engaged with Russian tanks in the field.
According to an army representative, the gunfire on the other side has been so precise that Russian professional soldiers are likely to be the shooter.
During the past 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
A Ukrainian patrol vessel that received artillery hits in the Sea of Asova yesterday sank in the morning, says the border guard.
Eight Marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The border guard wasn't sure what the ship was shot from.
The Separatists told me yesterday in social media that they'd fired on the ship.
According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russia will not attack Ukraine.
Lavrov, however, insisted that the Ukrainian forces immediately withdraw from positions from which they could not fire on civilians.
According to the Foreign Minister, there should be an immediate ceasefire without conditions in the negotiations in Minsk today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE.
Mr Lavrov also pointed out that Russia would respond to possible new economic sanctions.
Firstly, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will draw conclusions from the actions of our partners," Lavrov threatened.
Heavy rains flooded Malmö and Copenhagen
The streets flooded on Sunday in Malmö and Copenhagen as heavy rains hit southern Sweden and Denmark.
Floods cut several roads, mixed traffic, and buried cars.
The authorities estimate on Sunday that it may take time to relax the flood, even though the rains were predicted to stop by Monday.
Hard rains caught Swedish authorities by surprise, and no weather warning was issued in advance.
Meteorologist Ari Mustala, who is on call at the Finnish Meteorological Institute in Finland, estimated that the rainfront that plagued the area was very local.
The rain area looks narrow and stationary.
No wonder it's been hard to predict.
French Socialists should "shush and help France," Francois Hollande's main supporter says
Mr Valls urged the deeply divided left to "show his feelings" towards the Socialist President with difficulties, whose composition of the new government did not win the approval of the French majority.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our job is to stay by his side," Valls said and deserved a round of applause.
As a soothing gesture, the Prime Minister called on the government to leave the controversial 35-hour week of work in France alone, despite the new economic minister Emmanuel Macron's earlier proposal this week that the rule should be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the socialists to cooperate with the government.
However, the Minister of Justice, Christiane Taubira, caused discord by appearing at a meeting of the Socialist People's Party which had expressed disagreements and by criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing 'France to give up hope for the future'.
Marine Le Pen, leader of the extreme right-wing National Front, mocked the ongoing socialist dissension and said that he did not believe that the new government of the Valls would last a few months.
Francois Hollande may have left calling the war, but so has Manuel Valls, who was obliged to form a new government after the previous one did not even last the summer.
"And the new government will not last until autumn or winter," Le Pen said to the reporters.
He reiterated his party's proposal to disband the parliament and considered sure his party's election victory in early elections and he himself would be prepared to lead the party.
The French ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in March's municipal elections and the extreme right held the list tip in May's EU elections.
According to an opinion poll in the Sunday Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party may break down into several competing groups before the end of the Dutch season in 2017.
Political researcher Pascal Perrineau warned that the French would soon lose their patience if the new Socialist Government failed to improve the economy and record high unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the public must quickly see that change is taking place," he warned.
Otherwise, things could get worse.
Pokka betrayed the Finnish hosts Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouda's poker game was a huge failure in the recorded part of the program.
A fun video of Thursday's recordings was released last Thursday on the Facebook page.
In the video hosts Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pou are trying to record the morning Finnish advertising puff from the next day's broadcast, but the recording does not go quite well.
Alm-Siira freaks out when he tries to say the word budget rhyme, and his crazyness also causes Pouda and Rahkola to lose their nerves over and over again.
And these heroes should be allowed to broadcast live tomorrow, says the Finnish Facebook update.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been both liked and shared on Facebook more than 10,000 times.
Jorma K. Pota, 68, who worked at the magazine photo office, ranked third in a series of portraits in 1972.
This is the Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
In Helsinki, Fredrikinkatu, a meeting of the Socialist International was held at the Building Masters' House in May 1971.
There were many heads of state at the meeting and the security measures were enormous.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went with him.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we received more than five minutes to film.
I took this picture four and a half yards away.
The light and the background were right.
Right away, I realized I did it this time.
From the look on Meir's face, you can see that the leaders of the Middle East have had a difficult time before.
At that time, the competition was successful with pictures of known persons or events.
It is great that you can also succeed with other photos today, as long as you have an idea and visual torque.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best is Lasse Virén's fall from the Munich Olympics.
I didn't send it to the competition.
Dissertation: Aarnio investigation already cost over EUR 5 million
The investigation into the legality of the operations of the Helsinki Police Drugs Unit has already cost more than EUR 5 million and required 30-50 person-years.
This was assessed by Jyri Rajamäki in his doctoral dissertation on information technology to the University of Jyväskylä.
Mr Rajamäki proposes that the control of the legality of police activities and the fight against crime in general could be significantly improved by combining IT systems for investigations and judicial proceedings.
According to Rajamäki, modern technology enables multiple use of forensic material.
He points out that it is possible to build a system in which information collected for the purpose of investigating a crime is automatically electronic evidence that meets the chain of evidence and at the same time allows comprehensive judicial control.
The dissertation will be examined on Saturday.
Yle: The 1999 concept of vegetarian food was forgotten on the school wall: "Fish and chicken dishes belonging to the plant diet"
The picture of the special announcement on the wall of the Pirkkala Women's Travel School caused a food rage in social media, says Yle on his website.
Vegetarians!
Vegetarian diet at school lunch includes fish and chicken dishes.
Only when there is meat on the list will we make a vegetable option!
This is stated in a 15 - year - old report that has been forgotten on the school wall.
You can see the picture from here.
The image spread in social media has caused people to send indignant feedback to Pirkkala municipality.
Arja Vaarma, Head of Food and Cleanliness Service, tells Yle that the note left on the wall is not true and should have been removed long ago.
Apparently, before I came, there has sometimes been such an idea that has been discussed with health care in due course.
Every student gets a meal according to his wishes," he says to Yle.
Today, students in Pirkkala schools are offered a vegetarian alternative only with parental permission and a certificate from a doctor or nurse about a vegetarian diet.
The danger justifies the solution to Yle by the fact that young people's vegetarian experiments may leave nourishment short, and the absence of meat or chicken can cause wondering to the parents of the students.
Norwegian Cruise close to the $3 billion Prestige Cruise Agreement
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise company in the world, negotiates to buy its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for three billion dollars.
The transaction would allow Norwegian Cruise, with a market value of USD 6.8 billion, to have access to luxury cruisers and wealthy customers of the Prestige Cruises against Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
According to sources, information on a possible agreement may be published this week, but it is also possible that negotiations will not produce results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private venture capital company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
Sources didn't want their names out because there are no public consultations.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruise and the Prestige Cruises did not respond to any comments and Apollo's representative refused to comment.
The Norwegian Cruise company operating in Miami has 13 cruise ships with a route map covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its turnover increased by 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013, when it amounted to USD 2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which also operates from Miami, sails by Oceania and Regent brand names, comprising a total of eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was USD 1.2 billion, which is six per cent more than in the previous year.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the rise in the emerging economies such as China and India's middle classes in the coming years.
Companies compete to become the number one option for these new customers when they choose a cruise.
Prestige Cruises registered its first share issue on the US stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has held most of the shares in the company since the sale in 2007, amounting to USD 850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was established in its current composition in 2000 after its merger with Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) cruise company. The latter is the entertainment and casino company of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to published data, Genting's share of the company was 28 per cent, Apollo's share was 20 per cent and the private equity investment company TPG Capital LP's share was 8 per cent from the end of June onwards.
The combined share of Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise in North America's cruise capacity is 82%, as shown in the registration document published in connection with the issue of the shares of Prestige Cruise.
The City Board of Tampere is discussing the matter today.
Animalia hopes that the City Council will give strong support to this initiative.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, Executive Director of Animalia, University of Tampere, the doctoral dissertation should be completed quickly during the delfinaries in Finland and around the world.
Fortunately, in recent years around the world, there has been a general perception that the keeping of advanced mammals such as dolphins in dolphins in dolphins is not animal-protection or ethically sustainable.
This view should also be taken to Tampere.
The abolition of the Delfinarium is not only a question of animal rights, but also a question of Tampere's image as a tourist destination," Tuomivaara points out.
According to Tuomivaara, the death of the Näsi dolphin strengthens the requirements for the lower end of the delfinarium activity.
Näsi's death is a sad continuation of the dark history of the Delfinarium of Särkänniemi.
It is time to put a stop to deaths, close the dolphin prison and start to find out how to move the dolphins in Tampere to a restricted sea area, to a sort of shelter for dolphins, Tuomivaara insists.
Näsi was not able to experience a return to the original habitat of the dolphins, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Särkänniemi will have more time to experience life than an invigorated concrete pool, Tuomivaara hopes.
Animalia's objective is to ban the use of all species of wild animals in circuses in the overall reform of the Animal Protection Act under preparation.
This group also includes dolphinaries.
In support of this requirement, the Executive Director of Animalia, Tuomivaara, will take part in today's September 1st protest on behalf of the dolphins.
The protest at the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki takes a stand against the dolphin hunting season in Japan.
During the hunting season, some 2,300 dolphins are brutally imprisoned or killed each year, either for use in dolphins or for food.
Putin urges Kiev to open negotiations with Eastern Ukraine on the new state
On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded that the Ukrainian Government stop fighting separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "stateliness" of a different region, Russian news sources report.
His representative Dmitry Peskov later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled eastern Ukraine region would become part of Russia, but that its role within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking region's population the power to defend its own rights and interests.
Putin's demand to the Kiev government for negotiations with Russian-minded rebels as equal negotiating partners is in line with his obvious strategy since the violence began five years ago: he seeks to help separatists take over the region and thus force the Ukrainian Government into practice to grant independence to the newly proclaimed Novorossija, which will enable it to move towards Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the State Channel 1 channel, Putin condemned the efforts of the Ukrainian army to recapture the separatist-controlled Eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region, which was occupied by separatists in March and April after Moscow joined the Ukrainian Crimean Peninsula on 18 March.
The Kremlin and Separatists have recently baptized the area as "Novorossija," "New Russia" - this term resembles the days of glory before the revolutions of the Russian Empire.
According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said that the planned peace talks are an illusion as long as Ukrainian politicians carry out campaigns for the parliamentary elections on 26 October and government forces attack civilians in separatist-controlled areas.
"We must immediately enter into extensive negotiations, not only on technical matters, but also on the organisation of society and the status of the state of South-East Ukraine, taking into account the interests of the people living there," he says.
According to Peskov, Putin's reference to "stateism" is related to a broader independence that has been discussed for months with Kiev's leadership in an attempt to dispel the fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian Government can grant the Eastern regions the independence they need," Peskov says.
This issue cannot be debated between Ukraine and Russia," says Peskov, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, it is an internal conflict between Ukraine."
The Kremlin representative's remark, which was intended to correct the "wrong interpretation" of Putin's comments, stressed that the Russian regime is dealing with the separatist rebellion in the eastern regions in a different way from that of Crimea, which in practice took over an area with a majority of 2 million people ethnically Russian.
It would be much more difficult for Moscow to integrate even the Donetsk or Luhansk regions in Eastern Ukraine, because most of the 6.5 million people living in the region are ethnically non-Russian and because, according to pre-conflict polls, the majority of the population was in favour of remaining in Ukraine.
The independence that Russian diplomats have discussed in international fora would give Ukrainian local governments the right to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give the Kremlin practically power in a region that links Russia to Crime.
On the Black Sea Peninsula, which was connected to Russia five months ago, Russia's main fleet is located as well as commercial sea ports and historical coastal sites.
The Russian territory between Rostov and Crimea also includes mines, factories and metal smelters that produce vital products for the Russian army.
On 7 June, in his inauguration speech, Mr Petro Poroshenko, President of Ukraine, proposed that the Ukrainian legislators - after the new elections - consider constitutional changes in order to increase the decision-making power of regions that are not members of Ukraine's core region as regards their own economy and the status of languages.
However, his vision of independence appears to be radically different from that of separatists, perhaps armed and stimulated by the Kremlin and Moscow.
Putinin made his latest demand to the Kiev government for negotiations with Russian-minded rebels as equal partners after the rebels made further progress last week following the invasion of Russian tanks and troops in eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful region along the Azov sea coast.
The Ukrainian security authorities fear that the takeover of the Russian-sponsored Separatist city of Novoazovsk will be the beginning of a greater effort to take over the entire strategically important coastal area until Crimei.
It has led to massive civilian and military reinforcement of the city of Mariupol. Mariupol, half a million inhabitants, is known as a steel-producing port city located between Novoazovsk and a narrow area of land leading to the Crimean Peninsula.
On Saturday in Brussels, Mr Poroshenko spoke to the leaders of the European Union asking for further action to prevent future Russian violations in Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We will soon reach a point from which there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not take any decisions on direct action; the leaders proposed the creation of additional sanctions to enable them to be introduced if the Ukrainian crisis flares up again in uncertain circumstances.
Ukraine's soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in the Ilvaski region after two Russian armored units and 1,000 soldiers moved to Donetsk last week to strengthen the separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, a representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told journalists on Saturday in Kiev.
According to Lysenko, the first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were surrounded by Russia in Ilvaski was replaced by 10 Russian skydivers who were imprisoned in Ukraine a week ago.
Milan's opening goal was made by the Japanese artist Keisuke Honda at the seventh minute of the game.
During the second half, Sulley Muntari was hit first and a little later by Jeremy Menez for the penalty kick.
After his narrowing goal, Lazio also got a hard hit at the end of the game, but goalie Diego Lopez rejected Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez moved to Milan for this period from Real Madrid.
Milan's former attacker Inzagh's training debut at the San Siro Stadium was only halfway there.
39 000 admissions were announced for the match.
Australian posters and Gabi Grecko in the whirlwind of the naked image scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he is outraged by the fact that the hackers may have stolen the naked pictures of his fiancée and Hollywood A-list star Gabi Grecko.
The entertainment world has been buzzing since a bunch of pictures of Jennifer Lawrence's nude were released on the Internet as a result of a massive celebrity wax cocktail scandal.
The hacker has been told to have a total of 60 nudity pictures of Starfighter Lawrence and other superstars such as the top model Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and the actress Kirsten Dunst.
Photos of Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Grecko in Melbourne have also apparently been stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko last month, said to Confidential magazine, "This is disgusting."
All personal contacts and pictures should remain private.
It is a disgrace that private data can be stolen and disseminated.
Greckon in New York is reported to have commented on the case in the online magazine "shameful" and said that the victims "feel shamed."
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with this last boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of Palmer at the topless pool.
Palmer's movies include "Love and Honor" with co-star Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck series star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actor Browning didn't comment on the hacked photos yesterday.
Lawrence's representative said to TMZ that "it is an arrogant violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen became angry with the hacker in his tweet: "The publishing of images stolen from a cell phone is no different from the sale of a stolen product."
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, even from a legal point of view.
Finland played almost as if in its home field and rose to a sensational victory from Cuba in the volleyball World Cup.
Look at the photos of the fan rush.
Polish Katowice was white on Monday: not Polish red and white, but Finnish blue and white.
According to STT, Finland's profits were followed by nearly 2,000 Finnish supporters.
I felt like I was playing at home.
The fans had such a big impact on our game," Captain Antti Siltala of Finland said to STT.
Finland had already lost between 0-2 in the match, but won between 3 and 2.
In the fourth round Finland made a miraculous rise behind six points.
Cuba was already leading the lot 16-10, but after that the Finns got on top of the rapture.
However, a couple hundred Finnish fans were disappointed when the charter aircraft could not land in Katowice due to the heavy fog.
So the fans who ended up in Warsaw were late for the match.
Finnish ball fans have conquered Europe at a rapid pace in recent days.
In Bilbao, Spain, there are over 8,000 Finnish fans at the World Cup.
As if every Finnish basket was the winning basket of the match, US star player Stephen Curry praised Finnish basketball fans after Saturday's match.
The Council meeting will not be sent live due to technical problems
The meeting of Kouvola City Council cannot be viewed live today via the Internet.
According to the city bulletin, the transmission is not possible due to technical problems.
The city of Kouvola regrets the situation.
