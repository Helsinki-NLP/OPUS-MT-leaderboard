Found a 9-year-old boy on the run from Tampere.
The police have had a search mission due to the runaway of a 9-year-old boy in Tampere on Tuesday evening.
A missing persons report on a boy who left West Tampere with his friend has spread in social media.
According to the police station, the boy has been contacted and is not at risk of life and health.
The boy's father told the Night-Sayers at midnight that he was found.
He's okay, and now we're gonna start a follow-up.
The boy was found in the neighborhood of the home, my father told me.
Ronaldo, on the other hand, was ripping the paint difference to Messi.
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league this weekend and continued his production in the Champions League.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo over the goal kingship of the Champions League turned at least for a moment in favor of the latter.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo took the lead in all-time scorer statistics when he shot a visitor to Shahtar Donetsk's network with two hits on the penalty kicks and one on the game situation.
Ronaldo raised his score to 80 when the Barcelona Messi, which was evenly read with him before Tuesday, had 77 hits.
Real won the match 4-0.
Juventus has stumbled in the Italian football league Serie A during the early season, but in the Champions League's D-section, he began with a strong 2-1 victory in Manchester City.
Over ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata made the victory.
City's attack was dulled by the absence of Sergei Aguero, a knee-disrupting man.
In the weekend's Championship, Aguero didn't come to the airport until the last ten minutes.
In the Netherlands, Manchester's second club, United, was also hit hard by PSV Endhoven after having suffered a 1-2 loss.
Luke Shaw, a 20-year-old champion of ManU, only lasted 15 minutes.
PSV's dangerous-looking slider, Hector Moreno, hit the target's attacking ManU pack so badly that Shaw probably broke his tibia.
Shaw lay on the lawn of Eindhoven's home stadium ten minutes before medical personnel left to transport him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests 41 minutes to the 1-0 lead, but ManU's pleasure lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno evened out before the break in time.
During the second half of the time, the winning goal of PSV was made by Luciano Narsingh.
The season of painting in the Champions League began with the "A" section of Paris Saint-Germain.
It was an Argentinean Angel Di Maria who changed his shirt to a PSG.
Di Maria broke through right and lifted the ball past the corner of Malmö's goalie Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani did 2 to 0 for the PSG for the second half.
PSG's been betting on the season's success group.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of the league's small clubs, is not the best possible benchmark.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the star attacker of the PSG, met Malmö FF for the first time in his professional career.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played for 90 minutes when his team in Moscow, the Czech Republic, lost in the B-block match in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party demanded immediate resignation - the president gave the wrong speech
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has given the same speech again in the country's parliament at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether Mr Mugabe, who was 91 years old, is still alive.
The main opposition party, the MDC, called for Mugabe to resign because he is too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants hurried to say that the confusion had taken place solely in Mugabe's headquarters and that the President had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech dealt with earlier and now China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an extraordinary summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an additional summit of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
The request was evaluated by Donald Tusk, President of the European Council leading the summits.
According to the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to better register futures in Europe.
The negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are, according to Merkel, at the table of the Ministers of the Interior.
The teacher admits he shot his girlfriend during the 911 call.
Just a voice from a little colored university teacher Shannon Lamb tells the police during the 911 call that he shot his girlfriend and that the police have to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "golden dog" is alive and probably upset, as well as saying that the contact details of the deceased woman's next of kin can be found on her phone.
Inside the house the police found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten note on the page of the notebook: "I'm so sorry I could undo this I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me," said in a letter that according to the experts was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Minnesota, Delta State University, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometers to the school campus where the police believe that he shot and killed a well-liked history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this study.
Lynn Buford, police chief at Delta State University, reported that university staff heard about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made a fatal 911 call some time after that.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths rose by one more: Lamb committed suicide while the police were besieging the sound.
The authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb's motive day after students and staff had to hide behind locked doors because of the shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have published reports that the students and staff described Lamb as a talented teacher who, however, may have had problems.
Students told me they'd been waiting for her lessons.
The police of Prentiss' death, Gautieri, say that Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book in which he thanked "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History with a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students attended both courses.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers complimented Lamb, but said that he also seemed nervous and restless, "as if something had been wrong."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told us that he was under a lot of stress at the end of 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked for sick leave from Delta State University, saying that he had some kind of health problem.
This year he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's salary principles meant that, although Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it did not guarantee him automatic career development and assistant professorship.
William LaForge, headmaster of the university, said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt as far as he knew, but that "clearly there was something in Lamb's mind."
These are the questions that Lamb will no longer be able to answer.
After Lamb escaped campus, the police were able to track him when he moved back to Mississippi from the state of Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38 - caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house in the suburb of Greenville Mississippi, reported Washington County coroner Methel Johnson.
Lamb's car was still running in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this very house, although Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew the people living there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the university in 2009 and taught geography and education. The university has 3500 students and is located in a city with about 12 000 inhabitants.
Lamb completed his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston told me she was 15 years old and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a fun, older guy who spent many years trying to teach Hairston how to play guitar.
He was quite a charmer back then.
All the girls were melted wax when he was there, now told the 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in Jackson's suburbs in Brandon.
Looks like Lamb and Prentiss had been dating for a while.
On the 911 call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there's no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them at the riverside brick house in Gautier.
The police said the dog was okay.
Prentiss' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen told me they divorced 15 years ago, but he stayed friends, and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really upset," O'Steen described his daughter.
He was his mother's best friend.
O'Steen told me he hadn't met Lamb, but he had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both on the summer market three years ago.
Later they played a few gigs together.
O'Steen told me his daughter's making and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different online companies.
The bartender at The Julep Room and the occasional entertainment organizer Mike Shaffer, near Gautier, tells us that he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night against September 5, after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmonica performance for a few audiences.
Nothing seemed wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were kidding around and throwing shit at each other.
So they were both quite clever.
Dead teacher Schmidt led the first year's seminar program for students and specialized in Indians and colonial history," said school's English teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was the President of his fraternity and student government.
On Tuesday evening at the Delta State campus in Cleveland, there was a candle grab involving about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students and community members.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in Mass during which the university choir sang songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The lesson will continue on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Pettus from Greenville in Mississippi and Rebecca Santana from New Orleans participated in the report.
The case has been corrected according to the fact that the police now say that Lamb made an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and that even though Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it doesn't hire as many employees for the holiday season as last year, but the dealer of toys and baby products says that current regular and seasonal workers are given the opportunity to do more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40 000 people to work in shops and distribution centres across the country, compared with 45 000 in the 2014 holiday period.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that interviews with applicants will begin this month, and the number of staff will rise from October to December.
Although the holiday season is months away, the Christmas shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to assist in the occupation of stores and in the sale, dispatch and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his "date" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of Michael J. Fox was a huge professionally important moment.
It was also noteworthy for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the royals to arrive, and I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana's place was next to me," she said, coming in a documentary film Back in Time trailer.
The movie begins, and it comes to mind that I'm just a fake yawning and arm stretching away from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about Back to the Future, which was interviewed with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and production director Steven Spielberg.
Back to the future got its premiere 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "For me, it's undoubtedly the greatest time travel movie ever made."
Back in Time is available as a video subscription, DVD and some movie theatres in October.
The UN leader says that there is no military solution to the situation in Syria.
The response of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to Russia's increasing military support to Syria is that this almost five-year conflict "not to be resolved by armed means" and additional weapons only exacerbate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN leader again urged all parties involved, including the split UN Security Council, to unite and support any non-discriminatory negotiation with a view to finding a political solution.
At Wednesday's press conference, Ban announced that he was going to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent Member States - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - in the margins of the General Assembly's ministerial week later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and regional forces "made the situation impossible to resolve" .
Mr Ban urged five permanent Member States to show solidarity and consensus in dealing with the Syrian crisis as they demonstrated when agreeing on Iran's nuclear programme.
8 polls showing that Donald Trump is serious
Some people have tried to label him as a windshield.
Some people just think he's a joke.
Some of them are waiting to collapse.
Although some Republicans have tried to get Donald Trump off the top of the polls, it has not been (still) successful.
Of the last 11 national surveys, Donald Trump has been in charge in a two-digit number, and some have begun to seriously consider what this means for the real estate king's appointment.
Of course, the electoral term is only in its early stages.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to become a Republican candidate.
Commentators point out that at this stage in 2011, Rick Perry was losing his headship to the rising Herman Cain, neither of which got back any state in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in general elections.
However, external groups, such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Conservative Economics Club for Growth, have taken note of Trump's persistence and have begun to use their funds to overthrow him.
Recent support polls suggest that the real estate king is not just a transitory phase:
Trump's popularity figures have turned around.
Just before Donald Trump announced his nomination in mid-June, polls at Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans welcomed the real estate king.
By mid July, the figure was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August the figure was 52 per cent.
At present, six out of ten Republicans welcome Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they are negative.
These figures are also true in the first pre-election states.
In a poll by Quinnipiac University in Iowa last week, 60 percent of Republicans reported that they welcomed Trump.
Two thirds of Republican voters would be pleased if Trump became a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC poll last week, 67% of Republicans said that they would either be "excited" or "satisfied" if Trump were a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they'd be "shocked" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson produces roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% "excited" versus 40 percent Trump).
Next, the most exciting?
Marco Rubio is only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters would be "unsatisfied" or "shocked" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the rulers, became a candidate.
Trump's fiery nature is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trump has been widely criticised for his pompous speeches and insults, according to Monday's ABC News/Washington Post poll, 52% of the electorate on the Republican side at national level thinks that the real estate king has the right character for the president.
According to the Quinnipiac survey last week, in the state of Iowa, which organises the first party meeting, the figure is the same: 52% of Republicans think Trump has a character that suits the leader.
However, according to the ABC/Post survey, 44% feel that his character is not suitable for acting as president, and nearly six out of ten feel that his character is not part of the White House.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is the real alternative.
According to a CNN/ORC survey, four out of ten considered Trump the most likely option when asked who is most likely to be nominated as a Republican candidate.
At the end of July, four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.
Release of information: The voters of the Republican Party have not always had the brightest possible crystal ball at their disposal.
During the last parliamentary term, four out of ten Republicans felt that Rick Perry was being nominated and only 28% supported Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that most of the voters in the Republican Party believe that the Trump campaign is credible.
Even if the Republicans stood up for another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmented field is likely to have contributed to Trump's leadership, as the support against Trump has been divided among numerous other candidates.
However, the survey conducted by Monmouth University at the beginning of September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump receives majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points.
He's tied up with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who wins Trump?
If they were set up against each other, Ben Carson would win businessman Trump with a big 18-point difference.
Just the majority of Donald Trump's supporters have said that they have made a decision.
The new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only just over half of the voters in favour of Trump have decided who their votes will be.
Of course, things can change and no one can say for sure that they would never change their minds.
46 percent reported that they could possibly change candidates.
In any case, Trump's biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they had made a decision are twice as likely to be on Trump's side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since two months ago, when Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapers" in his campaign opening speech, immigration has been at the heart of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump's pompous drives Latin voters away from the Republican party and harms rebranding efforts.
According to a new ABC/Post survey published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the heart of things, so is Donald Trump.
Frustration in the government has reached a new peak.
Support for Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of the Republican voters, largely due to their role outside politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said in the ABC/Post poll on Monday that they prefer to choose a non-political person rather than someone with government experience.
They're also angry with the federal government.
Des Moines Register/Bloomberg survey in Iowa, two weeks ago, showed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa have become frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54% are "unsatisfied" and 21% are "very angry."
Jeremy Corbyn's introduction to the Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first appearance at Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election.
The new leader of the Labour Labour Party, Jeremy Corby, will meet David Cameron for the first time at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, and probably both the media and Labour MPs will be watching his performance closely.
Corby's been calling for "less theatre and more facts" for this weekly show.
He has also said that he could leave some of the opportunities to his colleagues.
This meeting is the first parliamentary test for Corbyn's leadership since he was appointed to the shadow government and spoke at the annual meeting of the Confederation of Trade Unions on Tuesday.
At the same time, the Labour leader's decision to stand silently during the national anthem in Tuesday's memorial service held on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain air war has raised criticism among Conservative MPs and has appeared on several front page cases.
Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention.
Corbyn's representative said that he "standing respectfully quietly" and confessed to "the bravery of the Royal Air Force in the British Air War."
Corbyn's shadow board member, Owen Smith, said to the BBC Twon Newsnight that he would have urged the Labour leader to sing a national anthem despite the fact that he felt that the royal house should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to be part of Corbyn's inner circle, arguing for disagreements in economic, defence and foreign affairs. Originally, less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant says that the policy differences regarding the role of the party in the European Union and the government's subsidy ceiling have also "massed' within the Labour Party since Corbyn was appointed.
Corbyn said at a meeting of the Confederation of Trade Unions that the Labour Party is proposing a change that would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, the shadow government's employment and pension secretary, Mr Smith, stated that the party was "very clear" that they were only opposed to the government's plans to lower the ceiling from 26 000 pounds to 23 000 pounds.
Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader that David Cameron has faced in the last decade when he has been the leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the Labour Party has promised a new approach to politics and now says that he has "enlisted" ideas for questions to the Prime Minister and has received over 30,000 proposals.
Mr Corbyn, Member of Parliament of the Islington North region, has said that the nature of the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confronting and that he intends to refrain from both clever words and pricking, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the financial secretary of the shadow government, is replacing her in Question Time when Corby is not involved - for example when Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corby has also proposed that other colleagues should sometimes be allowed to speak, and he has said that he has approached the President of the House of Commons, John Bercowi, on the subject.
When Cameron took the lead in 2005, he said that he wanted to move away from a political theatre that was often associated with the Prime Minister's Question Time, but later he had to admit that he had failed.
Since they began to be televised in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important measure in assessing the leadership's judgment, his control of the House of Commons, and his position with other MPs, although critics have criticised Question Time for becoming just a travesty that requires far-reaching reforms.
Photographed in Joburg: Training homeless young people to be photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and earn a living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a non-profit studio where homeless young people are taught how to take pictures of their neighborhood and gain profit from it.
BBC News met one of the first young graduates of the project.

The value of the pound rises as the wage growth in Great Britain accelerates
The value of the pound jumped upwards after the numbers showed a rise in the salary growth in Great Britain, while the FTSE 100 index rose with SABMiller.
Between May and July, British wages, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9 per cent compared with the same period last year.
The rate of growth was fastest since 2009 and was considered to bring with it estimates of higher rates.
The pound rose from over one per cent to $1.505 and from 0.84% to 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49 per cent to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most distinctive share on the market and increased by 20% after the offer by its competitor AB InBev.
The agreement would combine two of the world's largest breweries and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 per cent after encouraging news from the rival luxury product group Richmont.
Richemont's latest sales figures were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in China - which is Burberry's key market - had started to grow again.
Glencore's shares rose by 5% after the mining giant reported that it had raised USD 2.5 billion by issuing shares as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Packing and Paper Group Mondi's shares were one of the biggest calculators in the index by 4.3% after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation to "sell'.
JD Sports rose by 3.1 per cent after the sportswear company announced its six-month yield before taxes: an 83% increase to GBP 46.6 million.
According to the director of JD Sports, higher wages can damage enlargement
Peter Cowgill, director of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage for employees is raised in Great Britain, it may mean that "potential consumers' purchasing power is increasing."
However, this purchasing power is not likely to exceed the higher labour costs for the company," says Cowgill.
The cost could be related to the company's expansion plans, he added, which would mean less extra jobs.
Metcash launches a grassroots campaign against entry into Aldi's industry
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA trades from Aldi's attack in South and West Australia.
The food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in South and West Australia before Aldi's $700 million attack.
At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food brokers and build an IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as Adelaide show.
Traders and suppliers of IGA have jumped in, and brands such as Simmo's, ice cream manufacturer from Dunsborough, offer a taste of IGA's stores, and shop owners sell discount-price tickets to Australian football matches to their regular customers.
Metcashi is expected to reveal further details of its defence strategy on 29 September when this wholesaler of food, alcohol and hardware organises an annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake, as South and Western Australia account for almost 30% of the IGA trade area in Metcash and have higher profit margins than the IGA network in the eastern Länder of Metcash.
Shopping in South and West Australia is known to be a parish and IGA dealers have a much larger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30% in the South and 24% in the West compared to 14% in the Eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi captures about 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening up the first stores, with turnover coming from all operators, but mainly from independent dealers.
In this week's report, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA dealers may lose $360 million annually in sales and Metcash may lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open up 25 and 30 stores next year in the south and west, producing $500 and $600 million in turnover in these areas.
Loss of food and food sales and amounts at Metcash's high fixed costs base can cost Metcash about $13 million in operating profit losses before interest and taxes," Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the eastern Länder mainly for Ald and Coles, although a recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA's customers were the most loyal of all.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcashi's food and food sales will fall by 3,8% in 2016; 4,1% in 2017 and 2,1% in 2018, so that its market share will fall from 14% in 2015 to 10,3% in 2020.
Last week, the manager of the leading investment fund and founder of the Magellan Financial Group, Hamish Douglas, said during a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "very possibly lose in a decade'.
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglas' comments.
However, it has been understood that a member of Metcash's board would have contacted Douglas last week.
Since 2010, IGA's market share has decreased from 18% to 14%, and revenues from Metcash's food and food business, which supplies products to around 1200 IGA dealers, have decreased by 43% since 2012, reflecting the reduction in the debt financing of the operations when pressure is exerted on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler stands up for itself and has invested more than $150 million a year in reducing the prices of hundreds of products to the same level as Coles and Woolworths each week, helping IGA dealers restore stores by increasing the fast growing fresh food and bringing to the market a better range of private brand products.
Metcashi's President and CEO, Ian Morrice, says that lowering prices and improving stores has increased attractiveness, and he hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Steve Healy, President of the Australian Tennis Association, supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanai Kokkinakis deserves credit rather than criticism of his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered bystanders in a recent storm that has raged around his friend Nick Kyrgios. He deserves credit rather than criticism of his own behavior," says Steve Healy, president of the Australian Tennis Association.
Mr Kokkinakis, a younger member of the talented two called Special KSks, was unwittingly exposed to the incident of Stan Wawrinka in the Montreal Masters competition.
Shortly thereafter, in a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati, the main judge had to twice separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison from each other when Harrison declared: "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten that brat."
Although Kokkinakis was last seen breaking his bat after the cramp ruined his potential victory over Richard Gasquet in the US Open, Healy has been a staunch defender of Kokkinakis.
Right now, a young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth for another place in a duel with Bernard Tomic at the Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
"I think quite strongly that your Thana has just been dragged into the racket," Healy said.
He broke his bat when he lost a cramp at the U.S. Open, but he's not the first player to break his bat when he's frustrated, and I know Thanas well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But he has behaved excellently, including in quite provocative situations at the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little harshly.
She's very mature for 19 years, she works hard, fits in with the team and so on and has never had any problems with other players. She's appreciated in the dressing room, she's practicing firmly, she's in good shape and she's a very calm and mature young man, and I think she should be judged according to her merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to include Kyrgio in important games starting on Friday, describing this 'common decision' as a good solution for all, but still supporting the Canberran return to the team's regular equipment.
"We want the team to be fully focused on games and not all the polemics around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen really quickly, as Federer and Murray, for example, have pointed out, and he grows up in public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has received. However, we are trying to support him, we are trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe that it is best for both the team and him if he spends some time out of the public to reflect on these consequences.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border against Serbia, arresting those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim of damning the flow of migrants entering the country.
There was chaos at the border as hundreds of migrants flocked to neutral territory and the Serbian authorities reacted with dismay.
People who fled the violence of their own countries have now erected their tents and settled on an undefined stretch of the road between checkpoints in two countries.
However, frustration grew.
While the police helicopter was above them, immigrants said "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water to protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared that it is 'impossible to accept' the return of migrants from Hungary when they are constantly arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
" (Serb) wants to be part of the solution, not to cause damage to civilians.
The debate must take place in the next few days with other countries and Brussels," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
Confusion on the Hungarian-Serb border arose after the failure of the 28 national groups to create a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the allocation of responsibilities for 40 000 asylum seekers, who have now taken over Italy and Greece, who spoke hopefully about reaching a final agreement - next month or by the end of next year - on which EU countries will take 120 000 additional refugees, including part of Hungary.
On Tuesday next week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded an additional EU summit to discuss the continent's migration crisis.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will work in the near future.
The emergency situation on Tuesday in two southern regions gave the authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis and enabled you to be closed and asylum cases to be speeded up.
At the same time, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, said that now that the fence on the Serbian border is ready, the country will also set up a barbed wire fence on part of its border with Romania in order to halt the influx of immigrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the largest bottlenecks and entry point for refugees in the European Union, many of whom are fleeing from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that the majority of those arriving are economic refugees looking for a better life, not those fleeing from war who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly at odds with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now define as a crime an attempt to cross or damage a 4-metre (13 ft) barbed wire fence built by the government on the southern border with Serbia and include longer prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"As a result of mass immigration, the Hungarian Government declares a state of emergency," the government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told journalists in the southern Szeged city.
We are very clear on this: crossing an illegal border is a crime.
Parliament still has to formally accept the expected military deployment next week, but the Associated Press journalists at the border have seen heavy-armed military personnel with their vehicles and dogs for days.
Orban's Homeland Security Advisor, Gyorgy Baktoni, said that the authorities had caught 45 people trying to cross the border, as well as 15 people who had already reached the country.
They got across by damaging the fence, are now imprisoned by the police, and are charged with violations as defined in the new laws.
The authorities will quickly repair the fence.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossing points on the border with Serbia after sending a wired train car to close one of these places.
The main border crossing point near Roszke in Hungary was covered with chaos when Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for handling people and crowds tried to infiltrate.
About 20 got in, but thousands were left outside.
One group of immigrants blocked the main motorways between Serbia and Hungary, saying that they refuse food and drink until they are allowed to come to Hungary.
2016 elections: According to a national survey, Hillary Clinton's lead to Bernie Sanders has narrowed by half
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will continue in two-digit leadership in the Democratic nomination contest, but Senator Bernie Sanders will be stalking him.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of democratic voters (down from 58%), while Sanders is supported by 27% (up from 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he is going to the presidential race, but he is in favour of 15% of the Democrat electorate.
More than five months before the opening of the primary elections, most of the Democrats say that it is still too early to say that they would have decided who to vote for.
However, Clinton's supporters stand by their own choice more firmly than those of other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has decreased among several population groups since last month's CBS News Poll survey, and at the same time Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is strongly in charge of women and moderates, but his leadership has narrowed.
His popularity with men has fallen considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's lead in democratic voters under 50 has disappeared, and he is now even with Sanders.
However, Clinton is clearly in charge of senior voters.
Last month Clinton led Sanders in a double-digit number among the Liberals, but now Sanders is leading this group by five percentage points.
About half of the democratic voters in the country say that they will be very supportive of Clinton if he becomes a party candidate.
One quarter says that they support him with certain reservations, and 15% would only support him because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support him at all.
It is not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are very likely to be zealous in supporting him.
Opinions are more confusing for those who are currently not in favour of Clinton - only a quarter would be eager to support him.
While 48% of Democrats say that they would support Clinton enthusiastically, the Republican number one Donald Trump says the same thing about fewer Republican voters (35%).
When Clinton's supporters were asked in an open question why they wanted him to be a candidate, the most popular answer was that he had the right experience (16%), then the most popular answers were that now is the time for the female president (13%), and that he is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Since the vice president has an influence on a possible presidential candidate, 57% of democratic voters would like to see him already in the race - even though a third disagrees.
When asked by democratic voters who they would choose second to the party's appointment, Biden is the most popular choice.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half say that they would choose Biden, who is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to seek the nomination of the Democrats, Hilary Clinton's management of Sanders will grow. If Biden goes with him, the management will be 20 percentage points, but if he drops out, it will be 30.
55% of democratic voters believe that Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential elections, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
By this standard, Biden remains far behind, but the proportion of those who see him as the most voted has increased.
However, when asked what was most important in the candidate, the democrat voters put their opinions ahead of voting.
Moreover, last month no democratic candidate or potential candidate was considered an impossible candidate for these voters.
The candidates or potential candidates of democrats are doing well on certain key issues among the electorate of their party.
Most people think of Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden is best able to handle the trio in honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of democratic voters say that Clinton is not honest and reliable, which is twice as much as Sanders (15%), but 27% say that they do not have an opinion on Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally agree that Clinton, Sanders and Biden agree ideologically.
When you look at all these things, about a quarter of Democrats say they have no opinion on Sanders.
Although the use of Hillary Clinton's personal e-mail address and server as Secretary of State still raises questions, most of the Democrats are satisfied with his explanation and say that it did not affect their general opinion about him.
But it is different when you look at America as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
The public's opinions were divided in March shortly after the matter came to light.
Most Americans say that email polemics did not affect their overall view of Clinton, although 36 percent say that their opinion of him has deteriorated.
More than six out of ten Republicans say that their opinion of Clinton has become worse.
Although the voters of Clinton's own party think he is honest and reliable, this is still a problem for him among all registered voters. Only 32% think he is honest and reliable, and this figure has fallen by 8 percentage points since last month and by 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say that Clinton is not honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55% of voters registered in the whole country do not consider Trump to be honest and reliable.
However, both Clinton and Trump are considered good leaders.
Of the six candidates in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered honest, but many have no opinion of him, just like Carson.
The margin of error in the study of 351 democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in a national poll
Ben Carson comes near Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
Two candidates collected half of all votes in the new survey, leaving others to fight for a foothold.
Republican voters across the country still strongly support Trump, whose support has risen from 23% of the CBS poll published on Tuesday in the previous Fox News poll before the election debate last month to 27%.
At the same time, however, Carson rose dramatically from 6% to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well with different demographic groups and is being replaced by Trump's highly educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field has fallen behind, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support has decreased most: from 10% last month to 2% today.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place at 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest survey conducted in September is +/- 6%.
Last week's latest CNN/ORC survey showed that Carson is on the rise in the polls: he has 19% support for Republicans, and Trump is ahead of him 32%.
According to the latest ABC News/Washington Post survey, Trump was also ahead of Carson.
As Carson gained popularity last week, Trump criticized a retired neurosurgeon for nothing, even though Carso apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday on his campaign visit to Iowa.
Five members of the fraternity are charged with the death of Baruch College's first year student.
Nearly two years after the student died in a fraternity ceremony in the Pocono Mountains area of Pennsylvania, five people have been charged with murder.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood of Baruch College University in New York City brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the membership dispute in September 2013, and then delayed taking him to hospital, thus contributing to his death, the police said.
Authorities say that Deng's eyes were blindfolded and loaded with a backpack of over 13 kg of sand, and then repeatedly tackled the ground as he tried to walk through an icy field towards the finish line.
Eventually, Deng complained that his head was hurting, after which he lost consciousness.
The members of the brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng fainted, but according to accusations they waited an hour before bringing him to the hospital, the police say.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, to search the web for information about his symptoms, and to contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood, asking for advice from him, Chris Wagner told at a press conference.
"This is where members began to hide their ritual equipment and thus practically put the welfare of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng," said Commissioner Wagner.
Deng could not be revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated blunt force trauma to the head, body and thighs.
"Too many families have had to suffer from fraternal culling when at least one student has died each year since 1970," said Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, in his statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is important.
The grand jury in Monroe County advocated that the first five members be charged with murder in the third degree.
32 other members of the brotherhood, including Meng, are also charged with violent hazing and criminal intrigue.
"We do not want to be held accountable only to individuals. If there is an organisation behind what happened that accepted the situation either formally or informally, they should also be held accountable," said Wagner at the press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national fraternity from contacting the local department.
This is what happens when the US Central Bank raises interest rates
The increase in interest rates will come, and the market for rising rates will fall, bond yields will rise and the economy will go into recession.
This is what we know.
What we don't know is how long it's gonna take or how long it's gonna take.
The past does not help much with timing, especially in terms of the economy.
Since the first withdrawal, the recession has taken only 11 months, sometimes as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the US Central Bank in raising interest rates has often, though not always, been a determining factor in how the economy and financial resources react.
That is why officials from the Federal Reserve have so vigorously stressed that investors should not focus on this because interest rates are being raised, but rather on the development cycle of the period leading to normalization.
Indeed, there are several variables in the equation.
In the end, however, market participants can see that all the fuss about raising interest has been excessive.
"The first increase in the Central Bank after the global economic crisis will inevitably be interpreted in some circles as the end of the "low-money" era," said Julian Jessop, Capital Economics' chief economic expert in global affairs, in a message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect that the gradual return of US interest rates to normal, albeit still low, will be a revolutionary shock that many people seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that it will not have any effect.
Below is an overview of how some sectors of the economy will react in the light of past developments:
As seen on the market in the last month or so, waiting for interest rate increases can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
"It appears that the return on capital tends to stop 12 to 24 months after the first increase, possibly reflecting a delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what will happen after the central bank increase.
More specifically, over the last 35 or so years, the market is generally strong, rising by around 14% as the increase is approaching, 250 days later, the situation is fairly stable (average increase of 2.6%), and the normal state has been reached after 500 days with an average return of 14.4% in the last six cycles, says Bob Doll's recent analysis of the capital strategy of Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on shares is generally clearer at a later stage of the increase cycle when profits start to fall.
The recessions are part of the economy, but interest rate withdrawals often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces certain challenges that have not existed in the past and can accelerate the recession.
This is especially the gross domestic product, which will be closest to its lowest ever level before the central bank raises interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 withdrawals since 1950 nominal annual GDP has only twice been below 4.5%.
Although the figure for the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent, few believe it will last when the third quarter has reached 1.5 per cent, says Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.
The increase in interest rates in such a fragile economic environment can be risky and raises the question of whether "this time is different', Deutsche Bank said.
The market partners have been prepared to raise the central bank throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which will end on Thursday.
Although many strategists and financial experts believe that the Committee can accept the increase at this meeting, futures trade anticipates only 25% probability.
"Our research shows that since 1950 all rise cycles have so far appeared in the supercycles of increasing leverage, where GDP has passed its pre-crisis peaks very quickly since recovery began," reports the report.
On the other hand, there has now been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst in the period of observation.
In the current cycle, the Central Bank has been by far the longest to expect from the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and it is now the 74th month.
Fixed return has also been unstable as the market waits for interest to be raised, and the model is somewhat similar to the capital findings.
The main difference is that when the Central Bank changes its line, its effects are reflected more quickly in bonds than in shares.
The direction of bond yields appears to change immediately with regard to the first increase/cut of the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the bond yield drops immediately," Deutche Bank said.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that raising interest rates will lead to convergence of longer-term and shorter-term bond yields, thus smoothing the yield curve.
High-income bonds often produce better in such a situation, although "we are still cautious about looking for returns," said Schwab's fixed return analyst Kathy Jones in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the central bank's policy expectations.
"In addition to the dollar's strength and the fall in inflation expectations, there are several indications that the market has adapted to the prospects of a tighter monetary policy," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is evener, credit margins have increased and volatility has increased - all of these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its stance.
Generally speaking, companies whose business is mainly located in the United States win when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debts are less performing when the increase in the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than the money they have.
"History shows that "quality" shares are generally more profitable in the three months following the first interest-rate increase," said Goldman Sachs analysts in their report to customers.
Companies with strong turnover passed low turnover enterprises by an average of five percentage points after the increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Enterprises with high return on capital and low volatility shares performed better than those with lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
The debt is going to be a big problem.
The companies with a high level of floating rate debt are losing the most," Goldman said.
Outside stock exchange speculation, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from the increase in the value of the dollar.
Savers can also gain profits with higher returns, even though experts disagree on how quickly the impact is felt.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM," states Congressman Andrew Bingham.
Conservative MEP Andrew Bingham blames the channel for "publicisation"
He claims that it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish it from a commercial competitor.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying that they were just mimicking the Brit Awards.
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins criticised The Voice, saying that it was not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is "translating" to Classic FM, claims to be a leading MP adding pressure to the production company to prove that it is doing something that commercial production companies are not doing.
Conservative Member Andrew Bingham also told the BBC leaders that the public service radio channel seemed to be "publicising' its content and that it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between commercial competitors.
"It seems that Radio 3 - I don't want to use the term "people" - is turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards Awards, which was launched last December.
"The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, only appear to be the Brit Awards gala organised under a different name.
So if you are trying to do something different, there are two examples that I remember directly when you actually just copied something that is already on the market," Bingham said.
The president of the BBC denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival in terms of live music and sharing information with citizens.
Radio 3 teaches things about classical music that I cannot learn from anywhere else.
In fact, its commitment to live music and music is first class.
"In addition, I think it is really important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works," he said.
Earlier this year, the head of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel needs to work more than before to reach the audience because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC's offer, which was criticised for stepping on the toes of commercial competitors during the hearing of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Damien Collins, Member of the Conservative Tory Party, criticised The Voice, the musical competition that the BBC bought from the Dutch production company Talpa Media estimated at 22 million pounds.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and is not unique?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 channel program, with the astronomers Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced "in the style of the BBC."
He added that he wants the production company to "find success inside your own house" the next time it starts a show.
However, he refused to prevent the production of future periods of The Voice, or to order that the money of the licensees be used for other entertainment formats.
Online sales rose least so far in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Online sales increased by 7% in the first three months of 2015
Last month's rise was lowest since the start of statistics in 2000
Three years ago, online sales were strengthened by the use of mobile devices to make purchases
Experts believe that the November Black Friday may contain consumption
Virtual shopping has grown dramatically for over a decade and has turned many of Britain's shopping streets into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs of evening up online sales, whereas the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
Total August consumption grew least since the start of statistics in 2000 by only five per cent from last year.
Experts say that there are signs of evening up online sales, whereas the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
"If you look at the growth levels in previous years and go back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would become more rational over time," Andy Mulcahy, supplier of the JMRG sales index, told Guardian.
He explained that three years ago online sales were strengthened when buyers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that more people were shopping online and that they could be done in different environments, such as on a couch.
But now it's evening up, and (growth) can fall.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America has been seen as one of the causes behind the slowing down trades.
Experts believe that consumers will curb shopping before the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times as many buyers flocked to their computers to catch shops, knocking down the websites of many traders.
Experts believe that Black Friday, who caused buyers to fight over discoveries, can curb shopping.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one in five pounds was used online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of purchases are now made online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of using fashion chains in shopping streets.
Muslims bury the victims of Mecca's crane accident, the family of Bin Laden.
The Muslims carried 29 dead bodies across the streets during the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the collapse of the building giant Saudi Binlad Group
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were also injured when the crane collapsed.
29 dead were carried in the air through the streets when hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them. The victims died when the crane collapsed in Mecca's great mosque.
The mourners dressed mainly in white filled the route to honor the first of the dead who made their final journey to the cemetery of Al-Moissem.
A sad procession passed a sacred place where just a few days ago a crane fell through the mosque roof and fell down worshippers.
The bodies were released for burial when the king of Saudi Arabia confirmed that the Bin Laden family was responsible for the disaster, which also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 of the worshippers killed by a dead crane in Mecca's grand mosque were carried across the streets
Among the dead were the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Manchester, on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Akram had been in a great mosque with his parents before the annual hajj pilgrimage began.
The Saudi authorities have already sworn that Hajj Mecca will continue as thousands continue to arrive in the city.
Today King Salman stated that Binlad Group should not have left the crane up when it was not in use.
The Arabic version of the decision published by the State-led Saudi Press Agency stated that the Binlad Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The news agency's English service did not mention this detail, but it said that company managers were forbidden to travel abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman swore to find out what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the grand mosque where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered before the hajj pilgrimage to be held later this month.
The Binlad Group has not published any communications on the collapse of the poor and its representatives have not been apprehended for comment.
The royal decision also accused the group of not using up-to-date safeguards and of not cooperating with the meteorologist authorities.
There are dozens of cranes around the great mosque of the Mecca that are part of a huge building robbery run by the Binlad Group.
The Binladin family has been close to the Saudi dynasty for decades, leading major construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a rebellious son whose family banned him in the 1990s.
The collapse took place in windy and rainy weather only days before millions arrive in the kingdom for pilgrimage, which every capable Muslim must do at least once in his life.
Authorities report 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities ordered a million rials (£174 000) to be paid to the relatives of the deceased and to the permanently injured.
The other injured will get half of this amount.
The boss of B&Q says that working cheaply in Eastern Europe is behind popularity.
The British use more and more auxiliary services," says Veronique Laury.
The number of professionals coming from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
As a result, Screwfix stores for professionals will open 200 more
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores across the country
Author Rupert Steiner, city chief correspondent for Daily Mail
British people are said to give up hammers and paint pens and prefer to hire skilled Eastern European workers to do home-rehabilitation work
Looks like if you're smart with a hammer or a hack to paint walls, you're in a minority now.
You see, the British are hiring more and more helpers to do their own work in their homes," says the boss of the company behind B&Q.
The new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the home renovation chain, Veronique Laury, said that the popularity behind this is the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer their services at a mockery price.
This leads to Kingfisher planning to open up 200 new Screwfix stores for workers and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said that she wanted more women to work in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions made in the store were made by the more beautiful sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that the changes in the population must be taken into account: today there are more households of one woman who do more housework than before.
Laury said: "Most of the staff in our stores are still men.
We need to find a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of the product purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of only five women who run the most important companies in the British FTSE100 index. She has rebuilt her management team with equal numbers of male and female managers.
Kingfisher is almost the only company with exactly 50% of women in the group, including its Director General and Financial Director.
Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It hasn't been difficult to find good women in the management team."
Kingfisher reported a decrease in both six months' profits and sales after the group took on the costs of closing stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher is opening 200 new stores in the Blackfix and B&Q stores
The government of three aces decided to resort to coercive legislation to save the country's economy.
The visible effects were quite rapid.
The sharp head of SAK and other employee centers began to be forced immediately and as a result the country stands on Friday because of the widespread expression of workers.
A lot of people think there's reason to stand there, too.
Let's see if it's worth a strike when things are bad anyway.
Even a resistance movement has been established.
More than 50,000 people have already been online to announce that they are not going to participate in the demonstration but go to work.
In an old time of good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no Internet where to protest, but openly declaring yourself a scab would have been the political suicide of a small person.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of millions of trade unions does not give much thought, but it gives cause for thought.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as self-evident as it was 20 years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement as their own, values have changed
From the point of view of the interest in the operations of the Ay movement, the harsh solutions of the government can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
After years of showing that things are rolling with their own weight, the unions are finally getting to the point of defending, visibly and properly employees' rights.
In this way, the government may want to imprison the role of the Ay movement, as membership in the trade union is perhaps seen to be more necessary than before.
Regardless of what the organizations say, it is nonsense that Friday's expression of mind would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has been falling for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to decline and unemployment is rising.
You'd think these things would force everyone's head.
The University of Lappeenranta has a hard austerity cycle: The aim is to save EUR 8.5 million, reducing staff by 130.
The University of Technology in Lappeenranta will start a savings cycle aimed at reducing costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the University will open negotiations on staff as a whole with a savings target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, this means a reduction of around 130 employees.
In addition, two million are being saved from other activities.
The CST negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which anticipates an actual deficit of 8.5 million.
It is also affected by the cuts made by the government.
During this financial year, the University will produce approximately 2.6 million deficit results.
Expenditure will increase slightly next year, while funding from the Ministry will decrease by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The university's total budget is approximately EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive cuts in education and research and the reduction in corporate funding in our university is very significant," says Rector Anneli Pauli in the University's release.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but the reduction in complementary funding now appears to be in new proportions.
Negotiations with the stewards will start next Tuesday and will last the six weeks laid down by law.
Yle: Onnibus wants to visit Finland's railways
The owner of the Cheap Bus Company Onnibus, Sir Brian Souter in Britain, tells Yle that the company also aims at rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in getting involved in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of Britain's largest railway companies," Souter says.
Rail transport should be gradually opened up to competition.
The first is local traffic in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in 2017-2018.
Following local traffic, long-distance traffic will take place.
Souter says he's already approached the Department of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes Onnibus' plans.
Of other international companies, at least Transdev (former Veolia) has announced its interest in rail transport, which also has bus services in Finland and rail services elsewhere in Europe.
The Federal Reserve must take decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world will stand by as the Federal Reserve meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision as to whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
With Reuters asking 80 economists just over half of those who thought the Central Bank would raise interest rates last week now believe that the situation will not be resolved and that interest rates will be maintained at the current level of 0-0.25%.
This is an historic event, because it is seven years since the Central Bank cut interest rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank has the opportunity to get off zero and start normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Senior Fellow of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has been working relatively well and the recovery has brought billions of dollars into the balance sheets and created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore less rosy global prospects.
It has warned the market that they should be ready to lift, but the signs also show that they believe that the odds are against the increase.
The decision will be published on Thursday at 8 p.m. (CET).
The shooter at Delta State University left an apology note.
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning before shooting his colleague later that day, Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he was "sorry" for the first murder, hoping that he could cancel it, the authorities told me on Tuesday.
Mississippi Gautier police reported that Delta State University science teacher Lamb called 911 at about 10:00 a.m.
On Monday, he told me he shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police must send officers to his home.
He said he "killed his wife last night" and also mentioned that there was a "sweet dog" in the house that "doesn't bother anyone" but is probably upset.
The police asked the caller his name, but he wouldn't tell me.
Lamb didn't give us an explanation for the shooting.
When the police got there, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a message written by a 45-year-old Lamb saying, "I'm so sorry I wish I could cancel it.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me."
After writing the message, Lamb drove nearly 500 kilometers to Delta State, where he killed historian Ethan Schmidt before he finally killed himself late Monday when the police surrounded him.
William LaForge, headmaster of the university, said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt as far as he knew, but that "clearly there was something in Lamb's mind."
The authorities said on Tuesday that despite the allegations published on Monday that Mr. Lamb believed that Prentiss was in relation to Schmidt, there was "no information or evidence' of any kind of "triangle drama'.
Shawn O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss were married for about seven years and described him as "a good person."
A couple broke up 15 years ago, but they stayed friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who was "disturbed."
O'Steen told me that Prentiss and his daughter were "totally best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked online from his home, and Sun Herald said that Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
The police told me that Lamb called his relatives sometime on Monday to tell them "he's not going to jail."
When the police reached Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car on the side of the road, left it there and ran into the woods where he shot himself.
Lamb's debate on education in Delta State in spring 2015, says the curriculum vitae on the university's website.
Stars Lost their Charmed Ones
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), has had a rough time in recent years.
In 2001 he suffered from leukemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
Rumor has it that he has also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this really takes its toll.
Manchester United Luke Shaw is out for months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw had a double fracture on his right leg when Manchester United lost to PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League match.
Although the defenseman remained in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will still be able to play this season.
The injury was caused by Héctor Moreno's reckless tackle at 15 minutes after 20-year-old Shaw crashed into PSV territory.
She was treated for nine minutes in the field and had to be given oxygen before taking her to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture on his leg and he's in the hospital now."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day after that, and then he'll operate in Manchester.
The boy comes to Manchester United when he's 18 years old, gets into trouble and then plays great, and this is what's gonna happen.
When I was in the locker room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but it's gonna take at least six months for a double fracture, and he's not playing in the block stage.
I hope he gets to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky to get a red card and a penalty shot.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that an Italian trustee be mistaken.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say it became a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-foot tackle.
Shaw tweeted as follows: "Thanks to all your messages, words are not enough to tell me how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I come back stronger."
Related: Manchester United suffers from Luke Shaw and loses to PSV
The English defender has an additional incentive for recovery next June's European championship in France.
Coach Phillip Cocu of the PSV said, "It's a really bad injury."
If a player gets out because of an injury like this, everyone is very sad.
Our players are never meant to offend the opponent.
Moreno's leg was broken when he played against Van Gaal's Dutch in the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno takes this hard because he doesn't mean to hurt his opponent, and when he finds out that the injury is really bad, it's bad," Cocu said.
I didn't see it in that situation.
The only thing I saw was a ball going in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn't see Luke's tackle.
Moreno said to SBS6: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel terrible about this, I'm so sorry."
The PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after Chris Smalling's subpoena.
David Cameron knows Lorax better than this, right?
Each parent soon learns one thing: If your child loves a book, it won't take long for you to learn it almost by heart.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When the vacation service asked the Prime Minister about his favorite children's book, he chose Dr Seuss's The Lorax book, an environmentalist story published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes in a post published on the SuperCamps website and continues: "Fun, moving, creative and strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children because it always seems to have a picture or message that we have never seen before."
All of this is true, but the next paragraph in which Cameron presumably describes the plot of the book is a summary of the 2012 film version, where new characters and details had been added to fill in the rather short original text.
"In the Tarville city inside the walls, where all nature has disappeared and even air is a commodity, the Ted boy hopes to win over the girl of his dreams by fulfilling Audrey's desire to see the right tree," the text says and describes a love story that Dr Seuss, who died in 1991, was not written by the real name Theodor Seuss Geisel.
If this isn't suspicious enough, Cameron's text sounds like it's taken from the Lorax film, which starts as follows: "In the Tarville city inside the walls, where everything is artificial and even air is a commodity, Ted-boy hopes to win his dreams with Audrey girl" .
Considering that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so unfamiliar with the plot of the book. There a young, anonymous boy hears how the local nature has destroyed greedy, tree-chopping and needy Kerskanen, ignoring the story of the short, mustache creature Lorax, who "talks for the trees."
This relatively invisible PR task is probably outsourced to an assistant who apparently has never read the book 20 times in a row to a child.
The Prime Minister's publicist said the text must have come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff but did not comment further at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being sidelined from the British team, but it was still a tough spot.
Playing against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for the tour, I do not think that the last 3-0 series loss is likely to happen again.
I wouldn't rule out a foreign win.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the three-year-old team, but it includes good spinners and the team's thinking is strong: they have no scars from 2012, only youthful positivity.
Moeen Ali is developing in his spiral feedings and Adil Rashid is an attacker option, although he is an unknown factor at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth fell off the English cricket team and is replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth's team is understandablely difficult to analyze for me because I am his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against attackers under challenging conditions, and the simple but harsh truth is that cricket players are judged on their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about the choice of Joe Root before the press release, because, as I have said before, players are the best choice makers.
About 100 points more, and Lyth's season in the team could have continued, but he was himself responsible for his own fate.
Hopefully, if he gets more runs for Yorkshire, another chance will come.
England's head coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth's attitude even when he didn't do as well as he could, and that doesn't surprise me.
It's hard to answer the question of how long a hitter gets to leave a trail.
Lyth was selected seven times for the national team, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was selected nine times.
Only Compton was given the opportunity to play both at home and in guests.
The only complaint is that England first selected Jonathan Trott to the Caribbean when Lyth was in top shape, but that missed opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming along, and there's a hitter I appreciate.
As a cricket player, he has something that we in Yorkshire saw early this season when he scored 236 points against us in the Trent Bridge field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as others before him, but of course this depends on the team's composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen has been dabbled in the punch opening next to Cook, so that we can get an extra pitcher on the field, but we can keep four fast, and I am not against this.
I don't understand why a hitter couldn't hit him there, and this left-handed guy has already proven to be quite a cricket player.
Moe did not necessarily perform his duties in his county of Worcestershire, but he is a third to them and there is little difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games when the first grid fell, before moving on to the opening in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points and didn't remember the past.
Zafar Ansari will be on the team as a backup pitcher, and, as little as I've been dealing with him, he seems like a very impressive young man.
People can look at his unpretentious statistics... hitting an average of 31, with a ball of 35... and think it's gambling, but there aren't too many pitchers out there, and the voters chose young people.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few tough additions to the coach side.
The appointment of the Sri Lankan hitter Mahela Jayawardene as a consultant in games may prove to be a genius.
He's one of the nicest guys in the game and brings with him a huge amount of experience because he's done everything in every situation and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood joins the games of the white ball and brings both energy and a ruthless fuss.
I've always thought he was born to be part of an international cricket, whether it's playing or coaching, and he's got the same kind of brains to use as Mahela.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, rested in one day, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and at least I have no problem with this.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and voters do not make schedules.
And you have to remember that just as players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions are never taken on a light basis.
Britain's departure from the EU (Brexis) can be won if the economy is in difficulty in 2017
David Cameron's half-hearted re-negotiating strategies to keep Britain in the EU are becoming increasingly problematic every day, even if we do not even take into account the heartfelt Jeremy "Is it a yes or a no?" Corbyn's election to Labour Leadership or the anger of the Trade Union Confederation for Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Faragens.
The European diplomatic friend recently explained that because the EU is so deeply involved in various crises, not all of which are its own faults, some Member States are bored with Britain's self-centered agenda, which is full of discordant concessions and disturbing treaty changes which these countries do not want to see for the most part.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Federation of Trade Unions decided not to want them either if they undermine social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's Selfie Agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, taking a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without a local eyewitness, and then coming home, saying that they will win supporters for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outward into the inside of the British EU tent - 'Do not leave us alone with France', says from Berlin - suggests that the shortsighted ministers and officials of certain capitals are now at a point where they do not care if we leave.
Germany's cautious and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave his actions before it goes to ruin as it did for the long-stayed Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Francois Hollande is facing a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's a fading force, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain has a left-wing government.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrificing for the Selfie British when their energy should rather be directed towards preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want that either because of their own separatist tendencies.
So, my friend suggests, some of these ministers may even consciously plan to make useless remarks in the Scottish National Party style during the British referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Brexit process.
"The new negotiations had been organised" and "the new negotiations had no meaning for Britain."
Europeans have experienced bitterly how greedy the Fleet Street press can be and how EU-skeptical the dictators of the press are, what they were not at the time of the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, when our membership, which began in 1973, was confirmed by ratio 2:1.
They can vaguely recall Boris Johnson, the largest Euro-opportunist who named himself by writing about 'the EU's direct bananas' when he was a correspondent in Brussels in the early 90s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a bunch of tax aliens, hacking phones, and persons who have their registered office elsewhere and who own most of our big newspapers.
Tony Blair actually felt exactly the same way about them, but he realized that if you're in a cage with a horny gorilla, you have to give up bananas for a distraction if you don't want to be on that gorilla's lunch list and later at dinner.
In fact, Mr Miliband was more Blaire than Mr Blair himself, when it comes to opposing Mr Cameron's reconsultation, because Bair had agreed to the principle behind the EU's rejected constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thereby giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But the nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly patted me on the back at the Westminster Parliament Hall on Monday (I told him that he would no longer have time to waste on me), seems to be in danger of resuming Neil Kinnock's '80s boycotting Murdoch' strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
Although it may take time, he is forced to develop a coherent strategy to keep in touch with the media, not me, but no doubt Andrew Marr, whose BBC couch Corby left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, to put it nicely, evolving.
He says that he would like us to stay in a reformed Europe.
Well, most people outside the UK Independence Party Ukip's war paint enthusiasm and the most fierce nationalists in the Conservative Party can certainly stand by this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn fan" Benn said this on both radio and TV this week when his inner scout would have liked to admit that Corbyn's choice to name John McDonnell as the finance minister of the shadow government was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his daddy was on TV trying to be disloyal to his Labour Government colleagues without going so far as to lose his seat in government.
Hilary's struggles were more tempting.
But the fight to keep up with any "situation" - Benn's statement - was not what McDonnell said, nor, by all accounts, what Corby told the mains and MPs at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever is the unhierarchic, emotional and personal image Corby wants to convey (remember that she even touched me), the discipline of communication is important in the era of 24/7 TV, and especially in social media circles, which is an acceptable breeding ground for paranoia and fraud.
As Mr McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Mr Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to take the Labour Party's support in the referendum campaign for granted.
At least that's what Simon Jenkins thinks.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic tour of EU membership (and in line with their Benn-spirited economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult discussion among left-wing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small differences is the central dogm in doctrinal squabbles.
As far as his duality with NATO is concerned (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby's campaign is not to give up), foreign diplomats must only try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they also have suspicious voters) on concessions to Britain when it can be completely pointless?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed by the poor military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with the Conservative Government that cuts costs in power, as I was reminded at the start of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticize Public Health England's e-cigarette assessment
Researchers have said that the state-funded agency's claim that electric cigarettes are 95% less harmful than conventional ones originated from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom had contacts with the tobacco industry.
British Medical Journal (BMJ) experts joined Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on electric tobacco.
PHE published its report last month, describing it as "a comprehensive review of the evidence."
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of data and have pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, the medical magazine Lancet published an editorial that attacked the "exceptionally shaky base" of PHE's main decision.
Two other researchers who wrote at the BMJ have wondered whether the claims were "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: "The main principle of public health is that policies must be based on proven efficiency."
They say that the public expects that PHE's claim that "according to the current best estimate, electric cigarettes are approximately 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes" is based on a detailed assessment and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from one meeting of 12 people, where the multi-criterion analysis model (MCDA) was developed to synthesize their opinions on the disadvantages associated with various nicotine products and the results of this meeting were summarised in the study.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was the company named EuroSwiss Health, whose president was previously reportedly funded by British American Tobacco for independent research.
He also supported BAT's public health powers in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced that they had received funding from an electric tobacco manufacturer, but not the funding that he was reportedly previously receiving from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The selection criteria for the panel members are not explained, but there are a number of well-known e-cigarette supporters, some of whom also report that they have received funding from the sector in the investigation.
Others who were present are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the PHE tobacco director.
The study produced by the group "probably admits" that there is a lack of "uncontroversial evidence concerning the disadvantages of most products and most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these links or restrictions are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell claim that PHE's claims that "no evidence exists that electric tobacco is the route for smoking children or non-smokers" is premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, says that the claims made at the BMJ have been answered earlier.
He says: "E-cigarettes are far less harmful than smoking."
Half the people who burned their lives die of addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electric tobacco are relatively low, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there is so much public uncertainty over the relative dangers of tobacco.
Nearly 80 000 people die each year from smoking-related illness and smoke costs NHS £2 billion a year.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, although electric cigarettes are not risk-free, their disadvantages are only a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco - we are fulfilling our national responsibilities.
The BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 Director
Former Channel 4 President Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programs such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "give anything" for hits such as this Albert Square soap series.
Mr Johnson said that licence fees should only be used for the production of programmes not performed by other British broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes that are likely to have a smaller audience into difficult broadcasting times against the most viewed programmes by competitors and on channels such as BBC4.
After the president of the BBC, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to cooperate more with other organisations, Johnson said that he tried Channel 4 once for six years to establish a relationship with the BBC, in vain.
"I do not understand the idea that the BBC will produce and broadcast programmes that would clearly suit non-inventive competitors," Johnson said to the Upper House Communications Committee as part of its study on the future of the BBC.
If the licence fee is maintained - and I am not sure it would be a good idea for this media or in the long term - it should at least limit its production to programmes that others do not do and produce.
The Voice will be sent to the most important broadcast time, because it is to be supported as much as possible for its future.
The idea of no one else showing the show is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: "I do not understand why a regressive tax should finance programmes that could also be financed without state aid.
The Voice is one such and the EastEnders another, undoubtedly built within the house.
Frankly, other channels would give anything for it.
I don't understand how it's about a public service.
I don't think that would weaken the BBC at all."
Johnson, a series entrepreneur who led Channel 4 between 2004 and 2010, said that the BBC is guilty of crowd hunting "because of the goals of the people who work there and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support."
His comments on the most popular series of the BBC are similar to those of Tony Ball, former Sky leader, who used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC sell such series as EastEnders.
Mr Johnson said that the public service programmes for the smaller audience of the BBC "are going to BBC4, which often cannot measure the number of viewers, but the BBC therefore fulfils its responsibilities and then, in defending the £4 billion concession fees, can hypocritically say that 'of course, we are doing all these unknown programmes that no one is looking at'.
They're putting them on a mission site where no one ever comes to see them.
With regard to the licence fee, Johnson said to the committee: "I challenge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who gets the most out of it.
Of course you all think, we all think that 150 quid a year gets a lot of value, but I don't know if that's true for people who have 150 quid a lot of money because they don't use the BBC much.
Former director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who also testified to the Committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should re-evaluate its "information, training and entertainment" mission at Reith's time.
He said that only a small proportion of BBC production is now classified as training - he said the figures were 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should be modeled by Australian and Canadian broadcasting and change the task to "information, education and entertainment."
As far as partnership issues are concerned, Elstein said that the BBC should focus more on events such as Proms concerts, which, according to him, are shown on television only a few, and form an alliance with commercial companies so that they can all be viewed online.
"Audiogenetics" enables brain cell control by sound waves
The video shows how the shuttleworms change direction as soon as the sound impulse hits them.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems to be controlled by sound wave bursts.
The tiny shuttleworms change direction as soon as they are hit by a sound impulse that is too high for human ears to hear.
Impulses work by switching on genetically modified motion nerve cells with membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Related: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
Scientists said that worms show the functionality of a new method called sound genetics, which can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Salk Institute researcher Sreekanth Chalasani, in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the method could one day replace deep brain stimulation. It is an invasive procedure to channel electrical impulses into people's brains to treat Parkinson's disease.
Shuttleworms do not normally respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when they are surrounded by liquid with microscopic bubbles, the situation changed.
He found that the bubbles strengthened the ultrasound waves, which then passed through the worms.
The amplified ultrasound waves affect the TRP-4-ion channels, the structures found in the cell membranes of some worms.
The sound waves cause these ion channels to open up and activate the cells attached to them, reports a report published in Nature Communications.
In order to manufacture ultrasound-controlled shuttleworms, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motion nerve cells have TRP-4 ion canals.
When Chalasani used ultrasound for modified worms, the microbubbles strengthened sound waves and transmitted them to worms where they switched on modified motion nerve cells.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to switch nerve cells on and off using light impulses.
However, Chalasani says that the use of sonogenetics may have some advantages over optogenetics.
Unlike light that needs to be sent along optical fiber to the desired location within the brain, low frequency ultrasound waves can pass through the tissue unhindered, so they can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it may be possible to temporarily induce the target human nerve cells to react to the ultrasound signal in certain neurological treatments in the clinical environment," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin producing cells," he added.

Advertising Shame on Britain's Arms Trade
Watch a video against Amnesty International's gun fair.
Terrible killers!
Ankle-smashing legcuffs!
Crayfish!
And electronic stunners that cause painful pain but leave no trace!
The joyful voice and the imagery language of comics leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest weapons fair is a sharp parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British Government's willingness to sell arms to the repressive regimes at the ExCeL Centre in London's shipyard district.
Related: DSEI arms fair: authoritarian regimes arriving in London
With a separate campaign, many posters also appeared at bus stops and subway trains, requiring more information.
"Are you travelling on the DRR route on September 15-18?" together are asked using the London subterranean font and brand, when the DLR track turns into the image of the tank.
This September, a bunch of arms dealers are arriving on the DLR route... customers are being asked to help stop the weapons fair.
These 300 posters were made by artists whose works were featured at the Banksy Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs (Museum of Designs).
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped spread posters around London using "Ad Space Hack Packs" packages. It's a six-pound pack of six-pound keys that, according to the collective, "gets access to a third of the advertising space of the entire planet's bus stops."
Transport for London is not amused by this unauthorized 'publish vandalism'.
One of the parody ads produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Cruel Designs curator and University of Essex lecturer Gavin Grindon, artists increasingly question and want to take political work to outside audiences.
A lot of artists have started working with activists in opposition resistance when they realize they have to go to the outside world if they want their art to influence society.
Another anti-arming poster greets commuters on the subway.
Amnesty's video has been watched over the last 24 hours over 100 000 times on Facebook. It was created for free by the advertising agency VCCP, and the graphic designer and background reporter also worked for free.
VCCP's creative director Matt Lever found that the gun fair wasn't advertised at all - and then there was an empty spot on ExCeL's calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They were playing with the idea of a more realistic commercial for shady corporates, but "it was more stopable to stress it with bright colors and animation."
"They have done a fantastic job helping us raise questions about illegal torture equipment sold at the fair," Amnestyn Tom Davies says.
Now the British Government must take action to ensure that torture equipment is not illegally sold near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art related to the arms fair comes from inside ExCeL, as exhibitors are selling fantasticly adorned products.
Saab revealed in his press release that he received an order from the US Army for "the shoulder-to-shoulder AT4CS RS."
This includes "a unique pipe bet warhead, which exerts excellent effects behind the armor on the inside of the object."
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student dorm
It's been 11 years since I moved to a student dorm when I was 19 years old, and then I still believed in bars and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the forced smiles of the people I annoy and the many long complaints about others.
Much of what I have learned can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving into a dorm can be anything that gets on your nerves completely scary.
It's tempting to talk: tell me where you're from, whether you've had a year off and where you think about Corbyn, and why "I really don't love or hate Marmite because it's really just yeast extract.
Take a breath.
And help others take a breath - ask questions and show interest.
It will guide the conversation and help you find the people you like, not the ones you don't want to talk to even if your eyelashes are on fire and they'll share the fire extinguishers.
Give people some space.
People's rooms often turn into cocktail parties, movie nights and lofty entertainment places, but they are also the places where people dress and repair their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about starting a university when you're in a relationship
The university is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but many dormitories form a culture of wandering from room to room that is friendly, social and creates lifelong friendships.
It could mean hell to someone trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you permission to say "I like you and I want to be friends with you, but you have to leave now so that I can recover the energy I spent talking to you."
Try to sense when a student friend is tired of socializing - and perhaps send a text message instead of knocking on the door.
About knocking when the speech came in... knock.
A guy in my student dorm thought that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw quite a few things.
Make friends by baking.
Since you're starting a university at the top of the baking trend, knocking on people's doors with a chocolate cupboard and introducing yourself seems somewhat less strange, less "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something for you, now smile when I ask you personal questions" from the '50s.
Offering self-made treats is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors feel obligated to talk, and it may be that in the future they will combine your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you can bake.
Poorly mixed flour-sugar-fat lumps are likely to make people just pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
Understandably, stealing some chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk into your tea?
Ask the owner of the milk and check it out.
It's possible they'll give you permission even if they're boiling internally.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you get my sympathy, but try to take it more adultly than my housekeeper who mixed her milk with detergent to punish those who stole it.
He's in prison now.
You should not make noise so that people can't sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that proverbial pot beating the kettle.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor if they could play their drum and bass music quieter because it was 3:00 in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally quieted at 5:00 a.m., the girl kindly let them sleep for two hours before she put her own music on, locked her door and went to a three - hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dorm with you?
Or inversely, wouldn't it be incredibly awkward if you considered a housemate to be your future spouse, hooked up, divorced, and then you would see him every day and possibly lose all your mutual friends to him?
Of course the heart wants what it wants, but if the hot dorm partner isn't really your future mate, at least try to reason with you.
In the exhilarating moment when you notice that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between pranking and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but you can cancel in no time.
You can teach a useful and fun lesson about safety by hiding something, but never mess someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer - but don't attach their property with a blue sticker to the ceiling like twice.
Racist attack on the guesthouse of foreign students with crystal - House planned for reception center was shattered in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist blow was made to the guesthouse of foreign students in North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police told us earlier, this is not the accommodation for minors' asylum seekers, but the sleeping quarters of foreign students who have been in Finland for longer," says Heidi Luukkainen, teacher at the Evangelical People's College of Kite.
The windows and walls of the folk high school accommodation were shattered with racist signs such as swastikas, and a metal object had been thrown through a window in one of the accommodation spaces," says the Eastern Finland police.
According to Luukkainen, the responsible teacher for youth guarantee education at the folk high school, there were an estimated ten people in the vandalism building at the time of the attack.
"It was the weekend and adult people were free to move, so some could have been elsewhere," Luukkainen says.
There are people from 12 different nationalities staying at the folk high school.
They have already been students in Finland for some time and have recently arrived underage asylum seekers.
Everyone in the messed-up building has a status.
Some study in adult primary school, some study in vocational studies and others study Finnish," Luukkainen says.
A status is a so-called continuous residence permit, which can be issued for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
The Eastern Finland police investigates the attack as an act of damage and a violation of domestic peace.
According to Luukkainen, a briefing was held to students on Monday, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for over ten years, and this is the first time anything like this has happened," Luukkainen says.
Luukkainen says the mess has already been cleaned off the walls.
At least three men were suspected of being involved and had been on the move in a light passenger car.
I think this is the whim of a youth weekend night, since this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious than that," Luke says.
In Salo, too, a hospital has been smeared and a reception centre has been planned.
The case happened last week.
It was announced on MTV's website on Tuesday night.
A swastika was drawn on the wall of the hospital and written in English "You are not welcome."
There's been a police report.
Revision 15.9. at 16.02 Corrected police incorrect information about the age and status of the people living in the building.
The government is shutting down the Y train to Karjaa... with the passengers starving... "Oh, that's so idiotic."
The Y train from Helsinki to Raasepori Karja stops running in March.
The news upset the passengers who started the train at Helsinki Central Station.
In particular, the crash strikes the Siuntians," said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It is quite idiotic, because the population is growing and those who work need a quick and smooth connection with Helsinki.
This cannot depend on anything other than political will - or lack of it.
Bengtström says on HSTV's interview video, he's gonna take a tractor to the capital.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H and R trains on the main line are combined into a new R line.
Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula will be disabled.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR released information on which routes the Ministry purchases train traffic during the next contractual period.
The term of the contract will change at the turn of the year and the routes to be closed will be available throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement to be finalised in the autumn will be adopted by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Bengtström, a Siuntioist, believes that the government's train cutter is short-sighted.
Make the same mistakes that have been made in the past and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then comes remorse.
The Y train is also used by non-Raseporians and Siuntians because it is fast and passes several stations.
Annina Pöyry from Espoo was troubled by the fate of those travelling farther from the city area by train.
"That's exactly what sucks for those who have to redesign their journey," he said in pain on the Y train.
There's gonna be a little relief.
There will probably be a new train connection to the beach track that replaces the Y train in Helsinki's region of traffic (HSL), i.e. takes you all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This brings additional costs to HSL, in practice the municipalities of the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now beginning to explore different options and their impact on service level and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to assess the costs accurately.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about a million dollars a year for the Y train, although the Ministry is much more than this.
The R line on the main track misses two stations.
On the other hand, the number of train shifts in Ainola and Saunakallio doubles.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease from the whole country.
The Ministry no longer buys train traffic on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki- Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route will be shortened to Pieksämäki- Varaus.
Train shifts will decrease on routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka harbour and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million trips a year are made on excruciating shifts, while the total number of trips purchased by the Ministry is about nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring savings to the State of 12,3 million a year.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the Capital Timeliness book: "Marx is worth exploring"
The crises in the world economy have brought Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main theme Capital, published between 1867-1894, to the surface, writes George Hakanen, former Chairman of the SVP, in the book The topicality of Marx's Capital, published today.
"He will be taken more seriously now than in a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx's assessment of the development, internationalisation and penetration of the capitalist economy has proved surprisingly far-sighted in all areas of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of capital and fictitious capital.
The list of authors of the book based on the Capital Seminars organised by Hakanen also includes Aalto University Professor, respected financial advisor Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes Marx is current "now and forever."
But the former CEO of the Business Research Institute and the Business Delegation isn't Marxist, is it?
No, no, no, no.
On the phone, Korkman tells us that he does not consider Marx to be a timely economic thinker but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and scholar of literature.
"The usual idea is that the history of ideas tells of the wrong opinions of dead men," says Korkman.
True, Marx's predictions went badly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far from the initial course of capitalism, Korkman ponders.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"The most relaxing thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
We are discussing the interests of Marx again, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may be able to give inspiration to someone who wants to understand a big picture, a world changing as a result of a technical revolution," Korkman analyzes.
But what the government should decide tomorrow won't help Marx.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should just be stopped.
Still, Mr. Korkman thinks it's worth exploring Marx.
"In the '70s, Marx couldn't be read," says Korkman.
"The Maoists and the Trotskys and other sects hated capitalism, but even more each other."
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political burden of the past years.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's mindset - like other classics," says Korkman.
The UN demands war criminals to be convicted in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for a special court to be set up to investigate war crimes committed in Sri Lanka's civil war, reports AFP.
The UN report on the civil war in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long postponement.
The report blames war crimes both the Sri Lankan Armed Forces and the rebels known as Tamil Tigers.
At least 100,000 people are estimated to have died in the Sri Lanka Civil War.
We don't know exactly how many victims we're dealing with.
In particular, the major military attack in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, as called for in the UN report.
The Sri Lankan Armed Forces report blames torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, the victims of which were as likely as men and women.
According to the report, the rebels have been guilty of forcing bystanders and children into combatants.
According to the report, both sides have committed murders.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intended to organise the investigation itself, but did not intend to allow the establishment of the UN Court of Justice, as foreign judges.
The English yo test allowed you to weigh social media.
Autumn matriculational writings featured a long foreign language on Wednesday, most of which was English.
More than 16,000 trainees tested their English skills.
You could write a paper on social media if you wanted to.
Based on our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the essay of 150 - 250 words in English could be addressed to the e-journal counsellor.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt corresponds to Leelia's resting chair in Finland.
He was to ask for advice on how to get parents to look at things for young people too.
In total, there were four subjects, one of which had to be selected.
"It was the hardest of them," assessed the third topic Mia Lybeck, English lecturer at the Swedish secondary school in Porvoo.
On the third topic, there was only a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
But Lybeck said the fourth topic was pretty cool.
It had to write a fire talk about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least our school has practiced writing speeches," says Lybeck, and estimates the whole experiment as "pretty normal."
In Finnish - or Swedish - the English test was able to answer questions about texts that called for, for example, the adaptation of summer sole to climate change and the processing of large data masses.
Also on Wednesday some long Russians (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were written.
The autumn articles will continue on Friday, when the second Finnish or Swedish or Finnish test will take place.
In upper secondary schools, the test is arranged normally, which means that the employee statement does not affect it.
The matriculation examination board invites students to search for suitable transport connections in time so that they can make it to the test event.
You can also have more time if you can show that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
In Oulu, a shop was robbed at gunpoint.
In Oulu, a shop was robbed on Wednesday morning in the district of the clock.
According to the police, the robber was dressed in dark clothes and a ski mask covering his face.
He's a normal body. He's about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money.
They're investigating it as a felony robbery.
Police are preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of protesters in Helsinki - support teams from other parts of Finland
The government's protest against cutting decisions will block the city center of Helsinki on Friday, predicts the police.
According to preliminary data, up to tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, Akava and STK's unions meet at the Railway Square at 11:00.
Police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
In turn, the task of police officers at work is not only to carry out emergency tasks and other police activities, but also to ensure the success of a giant demonstration.
Roads leading to the railway market will be closed to motor vehicles for a period of approximately 9.30-14 hours.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed into the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi traffic will be cut off at Kaisaniemi's roundabout, from the west to Mannerheiminti.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
At least for the time being, it looks like it's enough.
I'm not gonna take a stand on a cop's work-fighting case.
According to Kujala, support teams from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki.
The police don't give us exact patrol numbers.
"Something is coming, but as a rule, we can manage on our own," says Kujala.
The police advises to avoid private car traffic in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic fog extends from Hakaniemi level to its core centre.
Standing traffic is expected until the beginning of the morning.
With protestors from other parts of Finland there are also a lot of charter buses coming to Helsinki.
They won't be allowed to the Railway Market.
In principle, buses are quite remote.
The rest of the journey must then be walked to the protest site," says Kujala.
The statement also stops Helsinki's public transport.
From the police point of view, there's a positive side to this.
The issue of the flow of public transport, which is normally at hand at these big gatherings, will now be dealt with on its own.
The organisers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government's economic policy may come to Helsinki.
The police expect the expression to go peacefully.
People are ordinary working people or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
After all, Finnish people are reasonable and peaceful," says Kujala.
Local protests will also be held in different parts of Finland on Friday.
Friday's statement is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
In many ways, the big expression organized by trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional.
For example, there is no such good comparison in Finnish political history," says Professor Emeritus Martti Siisiinen of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It's no wonder the Ay movement is protesting.
If it didn't, it would raise hands in front of the government," Siisiinen says.
The very right-wing government has hit the core points of the Finnish corporate tradition - and also those that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard grip is missing in contract law.
There are a lot of features here that the Ay movement is really being tried to get on its knees.
The same ay movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
For example, a mirror is needed because the ay movement does not have the support of all employees for Friday's statements.
What is new now is the sharp division that the expression of mind will bring about in the group that the Ay Movement would want to participate in the demonstration.
The unemployed from different parts of Finland showed their minds at the Parliament House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a reference point for Friday's expression, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed," says Siisiainen, organized in 1993.
In the middle of the deepest recession, the Murder Thursday gathered 20,000 unemployed.
The Esko Ahon (central) government stumbled from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relationship between the Finnish Government and employees' organisations had never been as bad before as during the Aho bourgeois government.
Now the relationship between the government and the Ay movement may be even worse than it was in the days of Murder Thursdays.
Besides, Finland's largest bourgeois government is now in power," Siisiinen says.
The current government coalition is still so interesting that it is so tight on the right, despite what the basic Finns have said.
There were certain elements of the old labor movement at the time.
Several thousand protesters are expected on Friday.
The expression also stops public transport and possibly closes up day care centres and schools.
Although the expression does not receive undivided support from employees, it can become the largest for years.
In recent years some 300 demonstrations have taken place annually in Helsinki.
They're from side to side.
Traditionally, Finnish AY protests have been quite peaceful - although practices have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is law-abiding.
The protesters strive to avoid damaging or destroying property," Siisiinen says.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of protest changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous about throwing eggs and the police were prepared to get pig shit on their heads.
The firefighter strike lasted for three months in 1998.
There were also spectacular strikes among pilots and air traffic controllers.
Remember these strikes and protests?
Metal and electrical strikes of the 1970s
The most significant strikes in the 1970s were metal strike in 1971 and power strike in 1977.
Seventy thousand metal men participated in the strike of the metal men.
The strike was suspended by a motion from the Conciliation Committee after seven weeks of the strike.
The metal men got a 16 percent raise.
In the spring of 1977, the power strike lasted 49 days and caused blackouts across the country.
Murder Thursday, 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20 000 people, many of whom were made unemployed by the recession, met outside the Parliament House to express their views on the job.
Firefighters strike for three months in 1998
The firefighter strike was one of the longest in the 1990s if not the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were caught in an egg rain while farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
"Siberia teaches, the EU quits" was one of the slogans.
For Espa, farmers skipped tons of snow.
The 1999 Helsinki EU Summit also prompted farmers to protest and burn hay bales in front of the meeting place.
Nurses strike 1983 and 1995
Nurses struck for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been on strike in 1983.
The strike in 1995 was colored by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened with strike and mass redundancies of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass redundancies finally accelerated the negotiations.
Doctors on strike 2001
"Doctors on strike - forced" was the slogan of strikers in 2001.
The strike of municipal health center doctors and hospital doctors lasted for about five months and produced a lively debate on how strikes can endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised the salaries of doctors.
Students on the move in 2013
Around 5,000 students marched for student support from Senate Square in Helsinki to Parliament House in 2013.
Central Crime Police investigates the background of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police
The Austrian police have requested assistance from the Central Criminal Police to identify the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped a truck in Asterheim near the German border with 42 refugees.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
Everyone in the cold truck was in good shape.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility are at the scene in Austria," says Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the Central Crimes Police.
At the end of August, other refugees on board a lorry in Austria became more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board apparently died by suffocation.
According to U.S.R., who first reported cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited company.
Among other things, the company engages in restaurant activities and its CEO is a man of foreign background, approximately 40 years old.
In Austria, two Iraqis have been arrested for smuggling human beings.
A refugee-beating captain, a former drug courier and a wealthy businessman - a story of five smugglers
A wealthy king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a stylish missionary and a taxi driver who thinks he's a good guy.
For example, these people are engaged in the smuggling of human beings into the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola at the University of Trento and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "clients," and the book Death Travel Agency is published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present tentacles in human smuggling, make suggestions for solutions, and present smugglers from different business steps.
HS presents five of them.
I'm gonna beat the shit out of them right now.
Kerkenna islands on the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head there for summer.
The islands are also ideal for smuggling, as there is only 120 kilometres to the island of Lampedusa, Italy.
For comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a burning captain in the chain and the father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimps, but it is more productive for fishermen to carry people.
That's what Emir has done with his blue, ten-foot wooden boat hundreds of times.
If the boat is full, it can accommodate 40 people.
After one trip, Emir earns about 8,000 euros.
Emir has five assistants looking for clients all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis flared up again.
Customers arrive from the mainland to Kerkenna islands in small groups.
Emir will put them in empty houses for as long as it takes.
Food is given in such a way that customers barely survive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer runs out of money, that is their problem.
We're going out to the water at midnight with a shut-off lantern.
The first night is driven off the islands, then stopped, waited for the day and driven the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes seafaring is hard, and passengers cry and vomit when they reach 20 meters [20 m] high.
At the destination, the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir is on his way back.
Emir wants people to be afraid of him.
That's why he beats his clients and at least claims to beat the shit out of them.
He says in the book that when the police caught him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed clients one by one from the neck and threw them overboard," says Emir in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of the Sahara.
I hear he's gotta beat up his countrymen for this.
I'm gonna beat the shit out of them right now.
We need to show them who's in charge here immediately.
Just a regular cabbie.
Goran is a regular taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.
His cab isn't very good - the starter engine is pulling its last and it's seen its best days anyway.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi moves at all and moves towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where families are mostly admitted.
In the forests surrounding the city center, men traveling without their families are staying in tents, lavas and abandoned cars, which now everyone has managed to find or build.
Families living in the forest who have not submitted an asylum application to Serbia for one reason or another.
Some also stay in private dwellings, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans the route requires a large number of border crossings and weeks of walking in difficult terrain, often mountain areas and in the dark.
Eventually, when entering the Bogovaða area, the great node of human smuggling, people are tired of death.
Goran's riders are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their business once and that's enough," Goran says.
He says the Africans are trying to bargain.
That's what Goran doesn't like.
He's a jerk all the way.
For example, the price is set at EUR 300 first, then they count it to 200 and finally offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he's a nice man with a good heart.
I don't care about money.
I just do my job and help people," he says in the book.
Goran tells us that he works cheaper than others and that he only charges EUR 50 per person for a ride to the Hungarian border.
It's about 200 miles away, most of it nicely on the highway.
I hear that colleagues are asking for three or four times the price.
Goran earns about 50,000 euros a year.
It is not a large sum for smugglers, but in Serbia a very nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not be transported 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his rides a mile from the border.
Then he shows his clients the right direction and he flies away.
In the Work of Mercy
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called the Missionary, and it's not just a nickname.
He really does have a Protestant church in Kampala, Uganda's capital, visited by many of the refugees from Congo, as well as a small center for helping Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business in which people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He sees himself doing the work of loving - kindness.
It's important to the missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and makes sure that the rubber band of white underwear peeks elegantly underneath the low waist of the jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his terrain car and his three motorcycles.
When the missionary does not preach, he arranges people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
The customer initially calls one of the five telephone numbers of the missionary.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money carefully, and stumble into the shopkeepers crossing the border.
In order to get an asylum seeker or refugee status to the Ugandan authorities, we must tell them that they come from, for example, the war zones of Northern Kivu and that they have been forced to flee violence from their homes.
Often it is true, but if not, the missionary will arrange a new identity for the customer.
The old ID will be destroyed and the replacement will be replaced.
The missionary's contacts in the Ugandan police will help with that.
After that, the customer will be directed to the same place where the real asylum seekers go: asylum application, to NGOs, eventually to the UNHCR.
The missionary knows bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He charges separately for each step: submitting an application to the Ugandan police costs about EUR 100, managing documents for humanitarian organisations approximately EUR 150 and moving to a country in Europe for example EUR 4 500-7 000.
Folio and ice cubes
Tom is a beginner smuggler, a former drug courier.
A 40-year-old Irishman on duty off the coast of France in Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks on their way to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan, a French taxi driver living in London, and dozens of truck drivers who do not even know they are in the human smuggling business.
At night Tom and the taxi driver picked up their customers, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near the centre of Calais.
They're driving on the A26 and trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would go straight to prison for organizing illegal immigration.
Tom doesn't want that. He's been sitting on drugs for seven years.
Taxi stops, Tom and his customers run across the highway to a resting place where drivers sleep before continuing across the Channel to the British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck - we need to make sure it's on its way to England instead of Holland - and cut off the safety cable on the cover.
We have to do it quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver's in on it, but then it's more expensive.
Once the route is clear, Tom will wrap his customers in aluminum foil, the same kind that is wrapped around a roast or baked potato in the kitchen.
It should prevent a police thermal scanner from picking up the hidden device.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his customers in the truck and leaves the place hoping that the driver will not sneak in before Britain.
King of smugglers
Mummer Küçük is one of the world's most famous human smugglers.
The immensely rich Turk has been called the champion of marketing and the undeniable king of illegal invasions in the Mediterranean, which controls maritime routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and has continuously developed new methods of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he requires the money only when he arrives.
One of the new methods is the luxury craft scam: from Turkish ports they rent yachts to take American or European families to comfortable tourist cruises for a few days.
In reality, ships are being loaded to a crowd of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are being transported for a fee of between EUR 5 000 and 7 000 first from Istanbul to a port and then by sea to Europe.
Customers are kept in human stores, such as old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
They put people in minibuses and drive somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among the vegetation and wait for the sign.
When it is given, you must board quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden all the way under the deck.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, for there are no other signs of the crowd.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
Küçük will receive approximately EUR 53 000 for one luxury ferry trip after cost.
He doesn't handle practical matters himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, shelters and other smaller people to do the work for him.
During the summer season at least hundreds of transports are organised and Küçük makes millions.
He is thought to have bought undercover companies throughout the country, a pharmaceutical company and over a hundred apartments he rents.
Mummer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a member of the Turkish Democratic Party and an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical sector.
Since then, apparently, he's disappeared.

The American Olympic Runner tells about his illness and becoming a prostitute in his book
The new book by Suzy Favor Hamilton, a 1,500 - meter runner, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton in his book Fast Girl tells about ending his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published fragments of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the races in top shape and ran at the qualifying for the second best time.
But in the final, he panicked.
At the outset, he rushed to the top and defended his position of leadership with a maniac run.
150 meters before the goal, however, his strength was exhausted.
He collapsed to the surface of the track, and the other competitors passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot and thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself over the finish line," says Favor Hamilton in his book.
Later it was discovered that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt tremendous pressure for success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when he became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but she was fascinated by the idea of getting money for having sex with strange men.
She also convinced her husband to accept his actions.
Favor Hamilton's rate was 450 euros an hour.
He tells me he spent the money on a luxury life.
Another explanation of Favor Hamilton's becoming a prostitute was that he longed for the same adrenaline spikes as he had in competing in athletics.
Later, Favor Hamilton discovered that he was suffering from bipolar disorder.
The double life of a former stellar runner came to light at the end of 2012 when Smoking Gun magazine published an article on him.
Favor-Hamilton attended the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was one of the world's 1,500 metres in the time of 3.57,40, but he was last in the Olympic final in Sydney.
The world champion rejoiced when the union brought the Norwegian ski rooster under control: "Right back"
Norwegian ski king Petter Northug has exceeded the limits of propriety to at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Association have twisted the whole summer and autumn as in last year's athlete agreement.
Even though the union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been good enough to multiply the world champion and Olympic champion.
The Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northug from the World Cup for the coming season.
The decision was commended by the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was happy that the union put the ski rooster under control.
"Thank you for pointing your spine," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the union sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Northug seems to want to be part of the season's national team so he can advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent an alliance that would also take care of future generations and would not allow one athlete to solo.
At the same time, he recalled that Northug had been granted financial and other privileges by the Federation for many years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has a completely different set of rules than just because he's the best.
On Tuesday, Northug issued his own release, in which he declared that he wanted to play in Norwegian colours next season at World Cup as well as after World Cup and Olympic Games.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six World Championships, two gold medals.
Last winter, he was on the team that won the message gold in Falun.
Steak Translators' Shield Day is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On Shield Day, September 25th, there will be raptures in various restaurants and shops, which have been awarded the Roast Translators' Shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high-quality food expertise and lower the threshold for going to the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the plate as part of high quality.
At the same time, we want to remind you that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, but that the top restaurants audited and rated by an impartial operator are found all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of plate restaurants and organisations.
In Ostrobothnia, the day will be held in Vaasa Restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola, the Old Town Restaurant takes part in the shield day.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It has been decided to make the event one of the most significant international events in the organization, which will take place during the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland will continue to be the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki-lehti: A complaint to the Chancellor of Justice concerning the establishment of a Kauava reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to set up a refugee reception centre in the premises of the Kauhava ex-ship owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the critical infrastructure of the crisis period, which is used by the military and its partner, Finland's Separate Networks Ltd, is still located in the region on a permanent basis.
The Kauhajoki magazine says that, according to a private individual, investing a reception centre in the same building structure would constitute a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the armed forces may have interests related to the territory of the former Air War School and the airport, which have also not been explained in the preparation of the reception centre, the paper writes.
The case states that negotiations have been held over the last two years on the organisation of flight training and the outcome of any foreign operator to the airport.
The matter has been discussed with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistön (Ps.) and Secretary of State of the Ministry of Defence Arto Rädy.
A private person tells the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not about opposing the reception centre in principle but about the wrong place planned in the former garrison area.
The Kauhava City Board discussed the reception center issue last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Management means that immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö comments to journalists in the evening after meeting the chairmen of all parliamentary parties in his official residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, concern about the management of the refugee situation brought together all participants.
He considers it valuable that in Finland government and opposition parties are able to discuss the fundamental issues confidentially.
Especially in these times when we face major challenges
According to the Niinistö, the situation in Syria and the actions of Russia and the United States in the region can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, the Baltic Sea region.
Niinistö is optimistic about the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia will be able to do so, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the tension in the Baltic Sea.
According to the Niinistö, the NATO issue was also discussed.
The President did not take a position on the labour market situation.

The Finnish Agency for Early Childhood Education promises to inform you more about changes in operations tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, communication needs a variety of channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio talks are one channel among others.
Such a direct talk channel will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time," Sipilä said to journalists in Parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches become a recurring habit.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be delivered on Yle's channels.
If other channels sign up as a channel, we'll see.
This channel is being used tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires TV and radio speech for citizens.
This subject, which we are talking about here, is quite complex and requires a longer explanation.
That's why we ended up on this channel. Sipilä figured it out.
The speech will be broadcast from 21.05 to 21.20 on both TV1 and Radio in Finland.
You can also watch it in Yle Arena.
Sipilä's taking a big risk.
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä's television talk will not tell us about the more general internalisation of the government.
Is it the intention to take the right to define public debate more firmly into your own hands and refuse to discuss questions in the public debate? asks Professor Anu Koivunen of Stockholm University.
Reminds me of Mr Soin's recent comment that he does not follow the media agenda and lets it define himself.
In the interests of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these issues are not related.
Koivunen understands that commercial media is indignant about Sipilä's announcement.
It would be weird if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not announcements in democracy.
The role of media representatives is, by definition, to try not to take the political agendas as given.
According to Koivus, TV talk is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations of the speech.
Is there any more that we have heard today?
Or is he able to speak in a different tone, in a different way, or in different words, or to say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only going to be more of the same old, one must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
In this sense, too, the superiors take a risk if it is not a special situation but a routine speech among others.
There is a risk that Yle will be branded as a communicator of politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in line with Yle's interests or general policy.
Clever bet by the Sipila
In Sipilä's forthcoming speech, what the Prime Minister does not say is also important, the media researcher emphasizes.
In the evening we should look closely at what Sipilä is missing and not at," says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at Jyväskylä University.
According to the moon, the TV talk is a clever bet from Sipilä, because this allows him to bring out his own view without the sound of gravel.
This will bring the message to the public without a journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
Sipilä passes the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a risk that the media will misinterpret something from the speech, because no specific questions can be asked.
According to the moon, it's very important how Sipilä plays on TV - whether the sweat leaks, whether the hands tremble.
He compares Sipila to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can make a good presentation, it can work.
The situation is different from that of the government's being informed about something, because here, as it were, a person is speaking directly to another person.
This is what Obama and its partners do regularly (President Barack of the United States).
Very extraordinary.
Political researcher Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to the public to be truly exceptional.
According to him, it has not happened in decades for the Prime Minister to speak directly to the people.
An exceptional time requires exceptional means," says Railo.
The researcher thinks that this is the way the Prime Minister wants to get the Finns to sympathize with the blackmails ahead.
On Friday, wage earners' organisations will organise a demonstration and strike against government action.
Paavo Arhinmäki, President of the Left Alliance, says on Twitter that Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a announcement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed.
Antti Rinne (sd.) President of the Social Democratic Party announces that he will challenge Sipilä to dialogue.
This is no time for monologues.
Soon, six months after the election.
You can't hide for the end. Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on the run has been found in Tampere.
The boy was okay when we found him.
The kid's found it, and the kid's dad updated his Facebook pages.
The Police Department of Inland Finland also confirms the case to the Evening Magazine.
The boy went out to play around 4:00 in the afternoon.
Later in the evening, he was no longer contacted.
My father thanks all the people who helped me find him.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short period of time.
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed in the violent fad of young people: You create hatred
The Kurdish free fighter Makwan Amirkhani released the video on Facebook, which particularly appeals to young people from immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani made a speech against youth street fighting.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and who arrived in Finland at the age of five with his family, has so far won both professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking for a look at an Instagram account.
Videos have been downloaded into the account where young people fight with extreme violence.
Amirkhani tells me he's disappointed in the youth's fad.
26-year-old Amirkhan has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
Guys kicks people on the ground, sits on top of each other and beats without thinking about the consequences of this when you do such videos, Amirkhani updates.
It's hard to justify it anymore.
Some of the young people in the videos are of immigrant background.
According to Helsinki police lieutenant Jarmo Heinonen, fighting videos have been downloaded into social media by both immigrants and youths from Finland.
It's about you fighting on the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, Turku Amirkhani reminds us.
Amirkhani recalls that there are sites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
There have been quite a lot of these isolated cases.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be guests here for quite a long time.
That's a different way to thank you for being here, Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever become the target of racism, you will blame yourself.
Come on, guys, think about it a couple of times before you guys get in on something like that.
Amirkhani says that violent activity is a source of money for racism.
You guys make me hate things I don't like.
You guys are pretty bad anyway, and you're not gonna make it any better, Amirkhani decides.
SAK puts its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
Lauri Lyly, Chairman of the SAK, says on Twitter that the employees' organisation will consider its position on the alternative savings list presented by STK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on STK's proposal on Twitter.
Earlier on Wednesday, the staff centre organisation STKK announced that it would submit its own proposal to the government to achieve the 5% productivity leap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Kesk).
Mr Sture Fjäder, President of Akava, believes that the government will approve the proposal if SAK, STK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest SAK should soften its previous position.
Lauri Lyly, President of the SAK, said little on Twitter.
Mr Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock" and that agreements concluded by active parties are needed instead of compulsory laws.
Lyly points out that Prime Minister Sipilä's government's proposal for a social contract was not acceptable to SAK.
In the past, Sipilä stopped negotiations on a social contract when SAK refused to commit itself to the target of a 5% productivity leap.
Comment: There's a threat of a major protest... that it feels a little funny to shake a fist.
It does seem a little funny to put a fist in your pocket if you already have a reconciliation paper, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The moods vary from one side to the other in an employee camp.
Is it the intention to call down the government or to settle with it?
On Monday, the SAK's federal leaders expressed sacred hatred for the Government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened with arrest.
The hawk spread to the Aquavans.
The teachers' trade union OAJ threatened to close schools and kindergarten.
On Tuesday OAJ withdrew: no school or day-care centre will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd) was the president of STK.
He explained that he had kept in touch with the government and that he was preparing an alternative proposal for a 5% productivity boom, as demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Kesk).
Akava's president, Sture Fjäder (kok), immediately hurried to announce that his compromise paper is already ready.
There wasn't a peep from SAK's office at first.
It is difficult for President Lauri Lylyn (sd) to agree when the federal leaders just said on Monday to put the country on a stand on Friday.
Finally, however, Mr Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK would look for solutions to "open the labour market lock."
In order to create a joint proposal by employees, the SAK should be inclined to accept a 5% productivity leap as an objective.
It is no wonder that Palola's STK has relations with Sipilä's government.
The right hand of Palola, Jukka Ihanus, head of social influence at STK, previously served as special assistant to the Central Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
In fact, Palola described that the government's ay-know-how has constantly improved.
Coincidence or not, but the output of Palola took a little breath away from the Finnish solsticers, whose front image is marked by the ACP Marko Piirainen (sd).
It's kind of funny to put a fist in your pocket if you already have a compromise paper.
Edit at 6:00 p.m.: Added commentary for Lyly.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
Sergei Naryshkin, President of the Russian Duma, criticised the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
Sergei Naryshkin, President of the Russian Duma, considers Mongolia to be a better OSCE host than Finland.
In the capital of Mongolia, Ulan Bator, a autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun, in which Naryshkin made extensive comments on the Helsinki Celebration Conference in July.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians who had been forced into the European Union, such as Naryshkin, to attend a meeting - an issue on which the President was able to remind journalists.
We believe that this was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and to the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, according to Naryshkin's news agency Interfax.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU but also at the United States, where his access had also been blocked.
Sanctions are political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation got to Mongolia without any complications, so Naryshkin continued to pick up Finland by complimenting and thanking Mongolia for its "excellent organisation."
I am sure that the parliamentary assembly will go constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting that took place in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue should not have obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (Cok) who, according to the Russian media, has already discussed with the Russian delegation at Ulan Bator.
The lock meets the true playoff troll: "Males tight"
Tappara and the Clave continue in the Hawk Forest today as both are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that there will be no actual goal festivals in the Hawk Forest today.
Tappara went to Kuopio last night to dig a 3-to-2 profit from KalPa.
The rise was masculine, since last season's silver group was at its worst at the loss of two goals.
Tuesday of the lock was more minor.
The Raumans' catch of the smashed Blues was the guest of round zero points, and the loss figures were also 2-3.
Hard game, tight goals, if any play the same game as last year, Lukko-attacker Janne Lahti anticipates the setting on the club's website.
The killer has become quite a playoff nightmare for the Rauma.
For in the last two seasons Tappara has just dropped in the semifinals from the final series of the Clave.
On both occasions, a decisive seventh game has been called for.
Last season the Clave took the series to rehab already in the fourth game, but Tappara rose in the next three breasts and passed.
There are no major changes in the compositions of the groups except for the goalie.
The cashiers who rejected both of them yesterday get a flute shift today.
With Kappara's goal, Mika Noronen will make room for Tomi Bear, and between the Clave posts Rasmus Rinne will replace Ryan Zapolsk.
View angle: The ass is running a lousy play
The sports director Toivola wrote an inappropriate sequel to head coach Iron Rock, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote a Rocky movie in which he himself played the leading role.
The underdog put up a sensational struggle with the heavyweight world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a lot of sympathy, even though he finally lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's premiere, Mika Toivola wrote a restless Cinderella story to Pori.
An anonymous and wooden cauldron went to everyone's surprise at the Finnish Championship Finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but persistent underdogs like Rocky.
There were white Indians, Pori's Matt and Pele from Pele Pelto.
In the drop-off games, players colored their heads red and cut off the Iroquois.
Hope became a blonde.
Excellent TV reporter JP Jalo called Coach Neumann.
The aces took the silver that was won.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
Script writer Toivola believes that this season's renaissance works in the same way as it did ten years ago.
The man who works as sports director of the aces has built a pot roast on the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been hitting guys in the trough like Rocky pig carcasses at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Copper's earnings are in some other way than hockey.
Toivola has forgotten that in Rocky VI, the lead character is Pekka Iron Rockio.
Karri Stone has crossed Iron Rock with Sean Connery.
In Toivola's scripted Rocky, Iron Rocky is as clumsy as Connery would have been in the original of 1976.
There's no Rocky in the Iron Rock except a nickname.
Iron Rock's game philosophy doesn't include rushing and squirting.
He appreciates the hard game, but it's one thing to play hard like a pig.
Last season, Garret Stafford of the Aussies tackled Kappara with Jere Karelia.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Iron Rock put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
The only people that play for us are the ones who deserve it.
I don't accept that kind of game and it doesn't belong to the ace hockey, and after the game, Iron Rock, who was hot, got pissed off at the people of Satakunta.
The aces of this season's team is weirdly built.
We got kids, we got veterans, we got cops, we got hounds.
There are virtually no key men of best game age.
No wonder the head coach has been complaining about skill shortages.
How much have you been able to influence player procurement, Pekka Iron Rock?
Last season's events affected procurement and, unfortunately, the situation on the market was quite limited, Iron Kallio replied diplomatically.
It's smokin' underneath the surface.
The 1953 Iron Rock is reportedly interested in moving to Toivola as sports boss.
Men's contracts end in the spring.
The balance of the aces in the three league games of the season is equal to the loss of the goal difference 1-6.
Toivola shouldn't have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santa Santa Claus' mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuuka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under her husband's direction.
Yeah, I'm playing my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, the actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
She has been married to Apunna's ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temonen since 2008.
The couple have worked hard together before, but now Olga plays under Tuuka's guidance for the first time.
Olga's role in Apulanna's early years You made us beautiful is drummer Sipe Santapuk's mother Cricket.
Cricket crickets and supports his son, although his father Risto (who is represented by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I have become acquainted with my real role model, Cricket, the easier it seems to be to play the role.
He's a great guy and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me with the part.
Olga had already met Sirka before the film project, but since then, the two of them have come closer.
They've met, spoken on the phone, and they've been communicating.
Cricket's been really helpful.
We've been through a lot from different angles in their history.
Fortunately, the cricket also realizes that drama is drama and the truth may need to be colored a little.
Olga stresses that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apunna would become the largest band in Finland.
In the '90s, it was a recession and it was really lame.
There was a pretty low probability that someone really could, but Sirka had some intuition, and she was right.
Olga tells us that she had heard a lot from Tuuka about her youth even before the film plans.
However, the stories of parents have sometimes been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were up to.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from Tuuka, who was known as Heinola's notorious skateboarder.
Olga was an everyday and good girl who had nothing to do with Tuukka.
At most, he could have been secretly attracted.
According to Olga, he's worked so hard with Tuuka over the last ten years that a big project together doesn't scare him.
Everything's always been super good.
Now the whole production group is going to Heinola for a month.
True, a couple living in it often plan to drive home overnight because the distance is not too long because of their young children.
We're taking over Heinola for a month.
They have received us very warmly, only asked which streets and when will be emptied.
Iron Sky 2 became Finland's most expensive play movie
Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, has a budget of 17 million euros.
The shoot starts in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola begins filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
Scifi film Iron Sky's sequel, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will become Finland's most expensive play movie with a budget of 17 million euros.
Previously, Finland's most expensive film title has been Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation in progress will also rise after completion of Iron Sky 2, as the film has a budget of over 100 million euros.
The films directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa begin in October at Antwerp's AED Studios and last eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium next week.
A giant budget doesn't scare you.
I've been so relaxed!
I feel so relaxed about the script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone in the task force seems to realize that we're doing something that we've never done before.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Just because time's tight doesn't mean there's any fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience," he tells The Evening Magazine.
Originally, the budget for the film was set at 8-10 million, but as the manuscript developed, the budget also increased.
There's a big budget, but there's a big story.
However, 100 million could be added to the film because every angle and effect is so expensive.
Now everything's so tight, it's not loose at all.
Today, the film production company Iron Sky Universe launched a crowdfunding campaign and a bond with an annual interest rate of 4 to 8%.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
At the latest two years later, the company will repay the loan.
Udo Kieri, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov are among the actors in the action film.
Coward or cool?
Big logos go back to shirts
The fronts of the trendsetters have recently been adorned by big logos.
Not long ago, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
Advertising a hoodie or a T-shirt sign was seen as a bit of a hillbilly.
But times change.
Sportism has become a real megatrend of fashion, and so have the old, familiar sports molds such as Adidas and Nike.
And, like so often before, the line between funny and trendy is fluctuating: if something is right, it begins to turn into ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. the mold where trendsetters surprised by favoring the most boring basic clothes as a way to separate themselves from the mass.
Instead of a basic gray college, we're already putting on the sweater that's buried at the bottom of the cupboard, with the manufacturer's logo in front of it.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, Adidas' identifiable track co-drivers, favorite team jerseys and New York Yankees hats have made their way back into street fashion.
The Calvin Klein logos of the underwear that start to squeal on the edge of the jeans are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sportstimers to luxury brands as well.
For example, the front of Versace's scavengers makes clear what brand of clothing it is.
Would you be willing to introduce logos in your dress?
The Russian politician released evidence that I didn't get stuck for hours in the tank!
According to the claims, a special incident would have taken place in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015 was held for Russian military products.
In recent days there have been colourful claims in Russian media that the Russian Ministry of Emergency had to remove large Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything in his power to deny the information.
He even published a picture on his own public Facebook site where he seems to peek at the armored vehicle's hatch in quite good moods and at least those pictures are not about getting stuck or angry.
That's nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't enter the battle tank, but it was the assault tank BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier myself, Colonel, I've served at Ural.
I went inside, looked around and came out in peace," Zotov said to Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I didn't get stuck and I certainly didn't spend five hours in that position," he said.
On the Russian military television channel, Zotov explained that he admired the new Russian technology at the exhibition because he was a former professional soldier himself.
That's why I was interested in what was inside the carriages, and I admired our technology.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And even in the next exhibition I will definitely visit all tanks and all assault tanks," Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the reporter who wrote about it a fool.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside and came out.
I'm tall and ratty, but nothing like me getting stuck in a tank somewhere did happen," he said to Russkaya sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photograph of alleged sticking has been published, even though a total of 50,000 people attended the gun show in a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck was originally triggered by a case on Bloknot.ru, where Zotovin was told that he had broken out of the tank hatch while trying and threatened to shoot everyone around him if he didn't get out of his grip.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up article in which the exhibition organizers gave their views on what happened.
All they're used to is soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles quickly.
But Congressman Zotov, due to his large size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he certainly did not sit there for five hours," said Alexander Pisarevski to Bloknot, the coordinator of the exhibition.

A leak has occurred at the Kittilän mine of Agnico Eagle Finland, a Canadian-owned mining company.
The refined process water from the gold mine has leaked from the so-called tailings pond to the ditch.
According to the company, measures have been taken to correct the leak.
The pool contains neutralized tailings and purified process water from the foaming process.
In general, water is pumped either for reuse as process water or as authorised through the surface draining field into the environment.
The bleeding was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was observed.
According to the company, the quality of the leak water meets the current permit conditions.
No other matter spilled into the environment.
The leak was detected during the inspection round on Monday morning.
No structural damage to the reservoir's dam structures has been observed.
The company states that it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and remedy the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent employees.
Dansken Kuopopamäki: IMF warns against overcutting
The country report published today by the IMF is broadly in line with the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation pushed Finland into comprehensive structural reforms to cope with economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime allowances and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire contractual system and unemployment insurance.
According to Pasi Kuoppanmäki, the main economist at Danske Bank, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
The IMF estimates a lot of positive messages for government action, but on the other hand there are also warning words about what should not be cut too much.
These include investments in infrastructure, for example," says Kuoppanmäki to Talousanomi.
In the IMF's view, growth projects should also be implemented within the shortest possible timeframe to support weak economic growth.
The IMF anticipates an economic growth rate of 0.4 per cent for Finland next year, which will accelerate to 0.9 per cent.
Today, Danske's new forecast for the economic cycle predicts that growth will be zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have provided the basis for the latest findings.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported a small increase in total output in summer," says Kuopjamäki.
It has been possible to pay less attention to the weakened confidence of industry or other so-called softer indicators.
However, these differences are limited to a few percentage decimals.
Nintendo, recovering from death, appointed a new leader
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata who died of cancer in July, began her work on Wednesday, Nintendo told me on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and she was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for launching the successful Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimisha is no big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata's footsteps, assessed by Ace Research's analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
Kimishima's task is to bring Nintendo into mobile games, but not to eat the company's bread on the traditional game consoles side.
More and more minor asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service acknowledged that hundreds of children who have come into the country disappear every year.
SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter have reported this on their website, according to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of minor applicants disappear each year.
Chief Inspector Juha Kannelmaa of the Finnish Immigration Service tells us what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is there a similar situation in Finland?
How much of the applicants disappear under "land" per year?- In 2013, a total of 156 applications were made for asylum of minors who have been singled out in Finland.
We lost nine of them.
In 2014, the corresponding applications were 196 and 11 of them disappeared," says Kannelmaa.
The reasons for the disappearance may be that it is clear from the case that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and has possibly been found to be of age there.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue processing the case in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for examining the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, 134 of whom were subject to a decision to lapse because the applicant had likely moved out of Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared over the last 123 years," he says.
Is the number growing?
By September of this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum for minors who have come alone.
The overall statistics on missing minors are not yet available this year, but the number of minors is therefore known and clearly increased, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons, he stresses.
What about the proselytes?
Do they also disappear, for example, into the 'dark labour market'?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for the implementation of conversion decisions," Kannelmaa stresses.
Minister of the Interior Petteri Orphano (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered applicants.
He's taken action.
At the EU Home Affairs Council, Orphano, who discussed refugee issues, announced on Monday practical measures to manage the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see the photos of the equipment
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkonen for TV and radio productions is now on sale by a pioneer who has lost his job in the media sector.
Mikkonen's spouse, Nina Mikkonen, sells equipment on Huuto.net, which were once one of the most advanced professionals in the field.
The Internet ad was the first online magazine to be reported to my Evening Makas.
Today, much of the equipment has been left at the expense of technological development.
In the digital media world, television programs for Betacam tapes are no longer being filmed.
However, Nina Mikkonen is confident that interested parties will be found.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date, but these too will be needed as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitised.
On the other hand, there are also many hobbies - collectors and developers of their own studio," Nina Mikkonen ponders to IS.
The reason for the sale is that the Mikkonen are trying to move away from their current Storm Village home.
There's no way we can take all the stuff with us.
I'm slowly starting to inventory and see what things are being disposed of.
This is where I started," says Nina Mikkonen.
There is no longer any use for TV and radio equipment.
It is clear from recent strokes that a man who has worked a long career will no longer return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen's actual life's work was already archived in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up films and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic threatens to porch worse than expected: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
The drivers of the subway and trams will decide today whether or not they will expand their efforts in connection with Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to stop subway and tram traffic only during the demonstration on Friday.
In the afternoon, it will be decided whether traffic will stop all day.
Chief Trustor Pekka Hirvonen says that the poof is large in the field.
The night and shift operations are killing the drivers, so the government's plans to cut the extras are a source of opposition.
Hirvonen wonders, however, that stopping traffic all day is a kind of dilemma.
If the subway and trams stop by Friday, public transport in the capital region is virtually completely stopped.
According to VR's records, trains don't run between 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on Friday.
There will be no commuter or long-distance traffic on Friday.
Trains leaving before 6:00 a.m. will be driven to the station of destination.
According to HSL's records, most of the buses will be in the pit.
ACP members will be absent from work on Friday from 3 a.m. to 3 a.m. on Saturday morning.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, they are driven by superior forces, HSL's publicist Pirkko Repo thinks.
Repo says that HSL can't tell exactly which bus runs on Friday.
The wage earners' organisations organise a major demonstration at Helsinki Railway Square on Friday from 11:00 to 1:00.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place at the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, reports the news agency AP.
According to Sky News, refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water cannons against people.
A Muslim boy was arrested at a school in Texas... and the teacher thought a self-made watch was a bomb.
In the United States, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested since the teacher regarded the self-made watch he brought to school as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he just wanted to show off the output of his electronic hobby.
However, one of the teachers viewed the watch as a bomb.
The police were called, and the situation finally ended with the boy being taken in handcuffs to a juvenile detention cell.
Mohamed has never been found to have claimed anything other than that he had made a watch.
Still, it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a fake behavior.
According to Mohamed, the police had found that the watch looked like a movie bomb.
The clock is in police custody, but it was reportedly made up of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident occurred last Monday and Mohamed was punished for three days on forced leave from school.
His father is furious about the incident and the American-Islamic Council of the country is wondering whether this case is yet another indication of Islamphobia in the United States.
♪ Great Britain ♪ ♪ Labor leader refused to sing the national anthem ♪
In the song, God is asked to protect the Queen, but Corby is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism of the right-wing press has also been shared by members of Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has offended the people, believed Labour MP Kate Green at the BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corby should have joined the song.
Yesterday's Memorial honored the Battle of British Air Force pilots against German Lufthansa in 1940.
In its official statement, the Labour Party defends Corbyn and stresses that he paid tribute to the pilots by participating in the event.
We are all deeply indebted to the heroics of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national anthem, the statement emphasized.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided the ranks of the Labour.
In particular, there are those who fear that he will expel moderate voters with his radical views.
Corby's in favour of unilateral disarmament, ending austerity measures and increasing public spending.
For the first time today, Mr Corbyn is to appear as party leader in Parliament at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Mr Corby has asked the public for proposals on what should be asked by Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron hung on Twitter for the election of Corbyn as party leader.
The Labour Party is threatening our national security, our economic security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister tweeted with his own account.
The cause of the Minnesota family murder is still unclear - the father of the family was facing a lawsuit
South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating a family murder in Greenwood, Minnesota for a week.
A family of five was found dead in their home on September 10, and a couple of days later the police confirmed that the shooter was Brian Scott Short, the father of the family, 45.
After shooting a shotgun first, his wife and three children, Brian Short, killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days
The family was found after concern at school about the absence of children.
On the basis of this announcement, the police went to the house for a visit and found the short family dead all over the huge house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A Million House and a Successful Company
South Lake Minnetonka police chief Michael Sitar's case is still under investigation.
The motive for blood feuds is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and had created his assets on the social media site AllNurses.com.
In 2014, in an interview with StarTribune, Short told us that there are four million different visitors per week on the site.
I've been offered 50 offers for the company over the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to put into practice.
Perhaps at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
Among other things, the success was shown by the fact that in 2011 the Short family bought a crazy house in Greenwood for $2 million.
The house is advertised as a real estate site in Zillowi as a car collector's dream: there are not only 12 rooms but also a garage for eight cars.
Case pending
But according to StarTribune, the father of the family was awaiting a lawsuit.
Acchieve Test Prep, offering various prep courses, had sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, no pre-punching comments had been removed from Short's site and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a significant impact on Short's business.
Vesku Loiri offered me a cup of cake.
In addition, the owner trio was awarded with the Finnish Hippos horse owner's prize for the month.
This is great. Loiri commented in a good mood on her honorboard.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100,000 euros.
Artist legend Loiri was still confused by Fabrice Duo's success in the big race.
I still don't think it happened.
According to Lori, the coach of the successful horse, Korpi, will find full peace while working with the horse.
Pekka orders and decides where to take the horse to compete.
And I'll keep my mouth shut, Loiri bumped.
An amazing gesture from the NHL star, "The greatest donation ever made by an athlete"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P.K. Subban has donated $10 million (about €6.7 million) to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the hospital report, this is the largest single donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital with other fundraisers for the next seven years.
Subban made a deal with the Canadiens a year ago worth eight years and 72 million dollars.
So Subban's donation is significantly higher than his $9 million annual earnings.
Subban receives a lobby in the hospital for her donation.
Canadiens players have helped local hospitals significantly before.
A year ago, long-term captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same children's hospital and Saku Koivu collected a huge amount of money for another major hospital in the city to provide the hospital with the necessary PET scanner for cancer research.
You can order a wife from a Japanese café for the evening... serving food with nothing but bikinis and aprons on.
Theme cafes are tough in Japan.

Soon 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network: Attacks against car security started to be equipped
In addition, the Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) supports technological development and innovation in the sector," says Intel's release.
The Board consists of top security experts from all over the world.
Asrb researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections to standardise best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of best practices in cybersecurity.
The company will update the report on the basis of ASDB's research results.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consulting company, estimates that by 2020, around 150 million vehicles in traffic will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share web-based data.
We can and must improve the cybersecurity of cars," says Chris Young, Director of Intel Security.
With ASDB, Intel can establish best safety practices and support the view that cyber security is an important component in the design of every car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASDB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in data processing.
Ford Focus RS in Finland costs about 52 000 euros!
The Ford Focus RS model has been waiting for years like the moon rising.
Finally, the car is also starting to appear in Finland.
Ford released RS's information now that the car world is looking at Frankfurt's car show.
Ford's new four-wheeled RS accelerates with its 2.3-litre, 350-horse-powered engine from zero to 100 per second and has a peak speed of 266 kilometres per hour.
In Finnish terms, the price is also interesting; it is provisionally reported to be EUR 52 000.
The car is already available for order, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford does not report in his release.
Kia's favorite brand presented two new features at the Frankfurt Car Exhibition - a new Sportage and Optima
In Finnish terms, the new fourth generation Sportage is certainly more important than the two new ones, with which Kia intends to take a larger slice of the ever-growing SUV market.
The Sportage created under the leadership of Gregory Guillaume, the new European Design Director, is more round than before.
There's a centimeter between the axles and the outside dimensions, and the car's cutting the air even more efficiently.
The engine range is broadly unchanged, but a 1.6 litre turbo with 177 horsepower has been added.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption will be reported closer to the sale.
We'll have to wait a little longer for that, because we'll have a new Sportage coming in spring 2016.
Even before the turn of the year, the new Kia Optimat came to our country.
Suddenly, the novelty does not seem to have changed, but it is a brand new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of the upper middle class buyers with better driving capabilities, lower noise levels and higher quality equipment.
Optimos with 1.7-litre turbodiesel and 2.0-litre petrol engine are initially available.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate when Optima GT comes alongside them with a 2.0-litre turbo engine.
At the same time, it starts selling Optima Farmer.
Chisu returned to the stage... blew in a bold jumpsuit.
The singer Chisu is at the Life for the Child concert with other Finnish stars.
There's an impressive, open neckline in an electric pants suit.
The costume presents beautifully the singer star's graceful waist.
The whole is crowned with a golden metal belt and a red lipstick.
During a three - year break, a mother - made singer has lost her pregnancy pounds with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to turn one year old.
The singer released her first single on a new album in August.
I'm not really nervous about getting back on stage and standing in front of the public after a long break.
I've missed everything about music," the singer says.
In a couple of weeks, Chisu will release his new and at the same time his fourth album called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired the making of new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu will think.
Kim Kardashian's maternity style is astounding again - now you can see your chest
True TV beautiful Kim Kardashian gives the subject one after another.
She presents her pregnancy belly and breast gear freely in sexy clothes, last night at one o'clock in America when she and her sister Kourtney Kardashian left the gig of husband Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent for the breasts.
It reveals the color of the bra underneath the flickering flashlights.
The last time Kardashian wore an Amazonic maternity dress was when he visited a friend at a dinner party in New York just a few days ago.
The costume was emphasized by black overcrowded boots.
The third special maternity outfit is as fresh as last week's Friday, when the introduction was a pregnancy stomach.
The hard laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, the competition is terrible
The top model Manon Leloup wanted to correct the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary, Speaking Dolls, where Leloup and his colleagues talk about modeling.
Harpeer's Bazaar magazine compiled six hard truths from behind the scenes.
Every season starts with nothing.
Even if you had posing in top designers' costumes in the previous season, the new season will start again with castings.
And every season, there are new, fresh faces in the industry that compete with the bad guys.
Models rarely have places they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and can go for a year so that the accommodation is a hotel room or an apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearably difficult.
New York and Paris are wanted jobs, but they are the most stressful.
There's not just one kind of thinness.
Agent in New York may ask you to drop the pounds, but then they say in Paris that you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
In fashion groups, models and designers are always together and act as a support network at the same time.
When the Fashion Week ends, it's gonna be a bad breakup.
Models want this sector because of the opportunities it offers, but they are consumed by the fact that everyone thinks that work is just a showdown of clothes.
Models like to be their own people too.
The work makes the models feel like they're actors with a role to play.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
Models for the Tory Burch show last night.
Fashion Weeks are currently being held in New York City, where the designers will reveal their collection for next year.
Scrooge Salminen, who changed his style, plays the most unknown musician in the film, Apulanta.
Scrooge Salminen presents Antti Lautala, the founding member of the band, in a film based on the early years of the Apulanta band.
Lautala founded Apunna in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but resigned from the band in 1994.
After all, this is quite a challenge for me because I'm a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitar player, Salminen laughs.
I haven't wanted to meet the real Antti before the shoots because I want to make my own interpretation of him.
Antti is clearly the most unknown person in the group, so I think it's okay that I only learn her play style from the video.
I don't want to do a human impression.
The man who pilots the Scrooge Salminen and the Dogs band doesn't go into character.
Punk-manners come naturally with a man.
In the punk episode of the Stars and Stars program, I'm sure many people saw a foretaste, too, if they've ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been anything petty, but always going to the fullest.
During the years 1993-2004, the main actors of the "Tuukka Temonen" film, which played bass in Pupulanta, were announced today.
A core group familiar to the band's audience is still presented to the general public by quite unknown young actors.
The drummer Sipe Santa Claus is played by Teppo Manner, singer Toni from Wirta Tattu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka from Temo Iiro Panula.
Scrooge Salminen gave a tip about his future job last night when he told Snapchat mysteriously that he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Roope has already published a picture of his new look on Instagram yesterday, which he has had to make for the film.
Roope, previously seen in the mustache and jaw beard, has shaved his face to shave, and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
In recent days many parents have wondered how to tell the child about the situation of refugees seeking Europe.
Or is there any point in telling me about it?
We don't have to force this into question, a member of the SPR crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
Smaller children should be protected, for example, not allowed to watch the news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can remain in the mind and distress, he says.
However, if a child has come across television news pictures of refugees or heard from elsewhere, it is worth mentioning.
It is good to have a conversation about the child's starting point and listen carefully to what he asks.
A child's fears may be surprising.
They may not be the ones the parent imagines he is afraid of.
You don't want to scare a child in vain, even if you're distressed and scared.
A smaller child follows closely the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child too feels safe.
Bigger children are likely to come across a discussion about refugees at school, with friends or online.
Parents do well to bring it up with them if the child is concerned.
The fact is, not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents, together with children, can reflect on how we view this in our family.
In the end, though, do we feel that the world is safe or unsafe?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand: If the family also talks about difficult things, the child will have a model of how to deal with life's difficulties.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your children to help the weaker"
My powers at the end?
You can still be a good parent to your child
It's hard to control the Pallosalamaa that hits Vermo
Perttu Pohjola was able to grind Apila's Pallosalama into a blow in midsummer.
It was only making profits and second place until the end of July, the races in Tampere had collapsed.
Since the stallion was completely frozen, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered a period of time for his protégé from the vet.
The explanation for shutting down was found in the lookout.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not of the mildest end, but it took two courses of medicine to overcome it.
Since Apila's Pallosalama had to exercise lightly, Pohjola says that she is positively surprised by the horse's last run.
It was another SE mare after Taruntuuli in Turku in record time.
Apila's Pallosalama was under great pressure from the break, having been able to drive it normally for just a few weeks.
Taking those things into account, a slight bending at the end was understandable," says Pohjola.
The coach assumes that a good competition was a good thing for the Ori.
The horse's spirit certainly moved on, and I hope it would have evened out.
Apila's Ballslama has been a so-called humor horse.
When it hasn't been amused, it could have thrown fat without getting sick.
On a good day, however, the Ori has lost the kind of lightning girdle that opposers have been amazed.
At short speed, rivals can't compete with the Ballosalama, which can even deliver warm-blooded rides.
In Vermo there is a peer run in the hopes of the Nordic Region.
But the difference is how Apila's Ballsalama agrees to it.
It's pretty hard at the time of departure, and it could be under the boom of the departure car or something like that.
Hopefully the stallion will be calmer by now than Turku's leaving.
Apila's Ballsalama can also come out of the bow when it's okay, and we're gonna take it for a win, coach promise.
This is why you can't get rid of unnecessary iPhone programs.
Tim Cook, CEO of Apple.
At least some of the programs that come with Apple's iPhone phones may sometimes be removed in the future - but not all of them.
Apple will possibly delete some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future," says Tim Cook Buzzfeed, CEO of the company.
Apple's iPhone has a number of programs that are relatively few to use: FaceTime calls, Journal Kiosk, Health, Exchange, Podcasts and Tips, for example.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which entered the iPhone phones as an emergency update, although it is only necessary for Apple smart watch owners.
Cook says that removing Apple's software is more complicated than it looks.
Some apps are linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple iPhone apps work closely with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is looking into this because the company doesn't want to waste memory space on users' iPhone phones.
Inflation in the euro area dropped to 0.1 per cent in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only marginally in August, i.e. by 0.1% from one year ago, the EU statistical authority Eurostat reported today.
The rise in prices was pushed down by lower energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised its estimate of 0.2% slightly downwards from a couple of weeks ago.
In July, inflation was 0.2 per cent.
In August, so-called bottom inflation fell to 0.9% from 1.0% in July.
Eurostat's forecast for base inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Last month, energy in the euro area was 7.2 per cent cheaper than one year ago.
In the EU-28, average inflation was zero in August.
In July the rise was 0.1 per cent.
In the euro area, consumer prices rose most, or 1.4 per cent, in Malta in August.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest as prices fell by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent minus sign according to the EU Harmonised Price Index.
Inflation in the euro area remains persistently far from the European Central Bank's (ECB) target of 2% price increases in the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
Next year the increase will pick up to 1.1%, the Central Bank anticipates its new inflation forecasts released at the beginning of September.
Fed of the United States is now trying to tighten monetary policy.
The next recession in the United States will begin at its fastest in less than a year's time, but more certainly within three years after Fed's long-term interest rate rise.
And on the financial markets, the decline begins before the next recession.
Fed has hinted that he may start raising interest by this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession can hit its peak by the autumn of next year and as a financial market jam before then.
Or at least this will happen if the world's largest economy and financial markets function as they have used to - and if they react to Fed's extortion of money as they have done in the past.
Such conclusions have been drawn by the German bank Deutsche Bank's London market research strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive long-term market and economic cycle research.
The Bank distributed a Long-Term Asset Return Study report over 60 pages to its international major customers last week.
The strategists who produced the study and the report do not think they know exactly when Fed will start raising interest rates or what will happen in the economy and markets thereafter.
Instead, they use the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics to show how the economy and markets have behaved in the past during and after Fed's interest collections.
In addition to historical observations, they will look at the key variables of the economy and financial markets which are now on the same or another model as those of previous interest rates - and which may result from this.
It becomes clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a more shaky condition to withstand interest rates rising than ever before since the 1950s.
Maybe not even a year before the recession started.
The leaders who decide on Fed's monetary policy and its current stance have hinted throughout the summer and early autumn that the time is beginning to be ripe for raising interest rates.
The first increase in interest rates in over nine years can come as early as this week.
This will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed Board meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
The last time Fed raised its so-called Fed funds steering interest rate in June 2006.
That was the end of a series of relatively regular but small interest rates of 0.25 percentage points that lasted exactly two years, increasing Fed's interest rate from 1.25 to 5.25%.
The symptoms of the financial markets started in 2007 from the difficulties of the most risky housing financing in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis torn into a global doomsday nightmare.
A major recession occurred in 2009.
Last time, serious financial and real economic hardships began at a slower pace than has typically occurred since previous Fed interest collections.
Similarly, the trials were harder and harsher than ever since the recession of the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategies have been screening the rise and fall of the world's largest economies and the turn of financial markets since 1950 and in some places since the beginning of the 19th century.
Fed's interest rate increases and their economic and financial impact will be reported from the 1950s onwards.
The rate of recession has reached its fastest point in less than a year, mostly less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The rate rise on the financial markets has ended within two years of the start of Fed's interest rate withdrawals.
In turn, Fed has increased its steering interest rate by a dozen cycles of different lengths since the early 1950s.
Each time has deviated from others in some respects, and the number of times in the review is relatively limited, so they can hardly conclude anything certain about the effects of subsequent interest collections.
The strategies therefore remind us that many things are different this time.
And not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
The decisive causes of the financial crisis, let alone the culprits, may not be conclusively identified even by decades of research.
But three things about the causes which led to the crisis and which have increased its destructive power are probably somewhat indisputable:
1) In the 21st century, Fed, the euro area ECB and the rest of the world's largest central banks considered their key interest rates to be too low for too long.
They patched up the traces of the techno bubble, and then they grew the next one.
2) Over the decades, the debt accumulated and already too high in the various parts of the financial and real economy grew even more as a result of the excessive monetary policy of central banks.
The biggest debt bubble in economic history to date was created.
3) In particular, the crazy cheap debt financing, which has been packed almost without restraint in the financial economy, expanded most sectors of the financial markets' main policy bubbles from shares in real estate, bonds and commodities to date.
It is also unlikely that there will be a very strong dispute over the fact that the financial markets, which had risen to high levels, were particularly dangerous and unstable when Fed and the other central banks last pushed interest rates up.
Financial structures rigged with debt levers, let alone valuation bubbles, did not last much longer than after interest rate withdrawals had begun and debt financing costs had turned up.
The risks were realised as a result of the financial crisis, followed by a major recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
Deutsche's strategists are not guessing what will happen next, but give cause for thought by mentioning, for example:
1) Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy stance even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower for even longer.
2) Indebtedness has not been crazy cheap for a long time, as it was ten years ago, but now at its lowest price is literally cheaper than free.
As a result, the debt burden on the financial and real economy has not been reduced but now, in various parts of the economy, it is a much heavier burden than it was before or to the financial crisis.
3) The liquidity provided by the central banks, which was more concentrated and cheaper than before, has largely remained in the financial markets and has reduced key types of securities and property to the most expensive, whether at the pre-crisis peak or never.
And not only are the strategists lattice with the warning signs of the financial markets, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and decades of the worst recession to the model that has occurred in the past.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is unusually weak, but the pressures and risks of financial markets are vastly higher than before the financial crisis, when Fed next starts to tighten up its money taps.
Perhaps the picture of the future of Societe Generale's strategy, Albert Edwards, is not as strange as it may seem.
For a long time now, he has trained the Bank's international investors for the following full translations of Fed:
First Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst, and soon it's time for Fed to hurry out the financial fires with even larger QE money syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) which manufactures computers and printers will reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are directed at HP's business services, says the company.
In November, HP will be divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., which focuses on consumer pcs and printers.
HP's number of employees was highest in 2011, when it had 350,000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302,000.
The company records one-off expenses of USD 2.7 billion (about EUR 2.4 billion).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will reduce 25,000 to 30,000 employees.
The consumer-side reductions will remain at 3300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its activities to low cost countries with 60% of its employees in low cost countries in 2018.
The company says that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers will account for more than 10% of its operating results.
In the previous year, its three most significant customers brought 65 per cent of the operating result.
iOS 9: how to get a new operating system after an update release of iPhone Apple
You can request a new operating system by entering the Settings app, clicking "General" and then selecting "Software Update."
If the update is ready, the phone will give you an option to download and then install it.
Some have had problems since this installation when an error report "Software Update Failed" has appeared on the screen.
To overcome this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst traffic to pass or try updating via the iTunes programme.
The phone guides the user in the final process.
This may include removing applications to get space, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the update and also facilitated the process with a new tool that proposes the apps to be removed and then re-install them when the update is completed.
You should make sure the phone is loaded or near the charger during the upgrade so that the battery doesn't run out.
If the charging level is too low, Apple will not allow the upgrade to proceed because if the battery runs out, it can lead to the update being broken.

You should also make sure that you've gone through our list of all the things you need to do before downloading, so that things don't go wrong, and how you can protect yourself from it if they go anyway. iOS 9 brings new features, such as a much smarter personal assistant and hugely new productivity features for your iPad, as well as improvements that speed up and correct your operating system.
Yle: Minister Berner has worked on the board of the Tax Paradise Company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner has been a member of the Board of Directors of the Tax Paradise Company.
According to Yle, the company's activities involve so-called tax planning.
It is a Luxembourg company called Saltri II LuxCo, whose board member Berner was appointed in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Business Register, Berner is still an official member of the government.
Berner himself says that he submitted a resignation notice in May of this year.
I checked it out, and that's enough for me to file a notice of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration chains take place on an agreed schedule," Berner says in Yle's interview.
Membership after merger
The ownership of the Swedish company Kährs is managed through the Luxembourg company.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer who merged with Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner was a member of Karelia-Upofloor's Board of Directors in 2010-2013 and, after the merger, a member of Kährs' Board and a Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, Kährs' holdings run through a multi-tier ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted membership in the Luxembourg company at the request of Kährs' second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been on the board of Karelia-Upofloor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was asked for a partner who was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a venture investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt it was my job to take care of the benefits of the Finnish family company's capital.
It is important that we ensure that our Finnish companies' capital profits are taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context," Berner says.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's holdings in the company do not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up in the tax havens is due to the fact that Kährs' largest owner had a capital fund for ownership already in place by Triton, a Luxembourg holding company.
Espoo opens a reception centre maintained by the company
The first reception centre for adult asylum seekers is opened in Otaniemi, Espoo.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants today starting from 6 p.m.
The number of seats may increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 persons.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre in the property of the former Rescue College.
The operations are maintained by Luona Oy, whose field of activity is in particular the production of health care and medical services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy jointly agreed on security arrangements for the Centre.
STK is preparing an alternative labour blackmail package
STK will start preparing an alternative package for the government's work-related blackmails.
The organisation also wishes to include other employee centre organisations.
According to President Palola, attention is currently being paid to Friday's statement.
Alternative ways of reducing the cost of work will then be returned.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday," Palola pointed out to journalists during the meeting of the organization's administration.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) is not prepared for discussions.
STK economists have calculated that the change security of the government's competitiveness package is estimated to cost the employer EUR 30 million, compared with EUR 2 700 million on the other side of the package.
I don't know if there's a lot of enthusiasm on the part of the party to have a conversation if there's a one-to-a-hundred relationship on the side.
Palola: A constructive connection to the negotiations
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (in June) has requested alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is to submit a communication to Parliament on its own package and start preparing reforms.
Palola did not take a position on whether the timetable is realistic.
According to Palola, there is a contact with the government and it has been constructive to him all along.
According to Palola, surgery on Sundays is a painful place for the staff centre organisation STK.
The organisation requires the government to withdraw from the coercive legislation that would allow it to carry out some of the blackmails.
According to Palola, the STK does not warm up to the fact that the alternative package is being prepared with the SDP, which has been the subject of the case.
The employees meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the labour blackmail package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, the salary of the first days of illness is cut, overtime is halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
It is stressed that the central organisations have invited employees to the demonstration and that the intention has not been to organise the strike.
Akavan Fjäder says thank you
Mr Sture Fjäder, President of Akava, commends the MTK's announcement of the preparation of the alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STK now goes along with Akava, as Akava has been developing an alternative model for government performances for longer.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without SAK the package will not be comprehensive enough.
Mr Sture Fjäder, President of Akava, would like Lauri Lyly to join the SAK in preparing the proposal as an alternative to the cuts.
Earlier on Wednesday, Antti Palola's STK reported that she was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, Mr Akava announced that he had been preparing his own proposal for a long time and that he was ready to negotiate a 5% competitive jump from the country's government as an alternative to surgery.
The Akava has been ready to negotiate all along, and we have been writing an alternative model for government proposals for a long time.
We are prepared to look at the conditions of employment as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks," says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also join Akava, as STK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model for the government and employers of the country," says Fjäder.
The Akava Bureau will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
"Same boat, common coal, coyotes" - plays bingo while Sipilä speaks at night
Green Left of the University of Tampere
Viva bingo coupon for the Green Left of the University of Tampere for the evening.
In the past, Prime Ministers have made exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of Finland's economy at Yle channels on Wednesday night at 9.05 p.m.
When applying for a similar Prime Minister's previous speech, it must be 1932 when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the Prime Minister when he gave the famous radio talk that marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
The president and ministers then gave several radio talks during the winter and the follow-up war.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen used a television speech to end the strike by train operators.
A monologue, a monarchist act.
Sipilä's speech has aroused criticism and speculation all day about what is to come.
Paavo Arhinmäki, President of the Left Alliance, stated on Twitter that "Sipilä could consider his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a announcement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed."
According to the Greens Ville Niinistö, "a single phone call has already been made.
Leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
On Facebook, the SDP's Erkki Tuomioja condemned "monarchist action: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for them."
Antti Rinne, president of the SDP, challenged Sipilä to dialogue: "Soon six months after the elections.
Not a single appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
We've tried.
What are you afraid of?
Public service
According to the Prime Minister's Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it was commented live by Lauri Lyly, President of SAK and Jyri Häkämies, CEO of EK.
High has been criticized for making Sipilä's speech.
We considered the matter and stated that it is part of the public service mission to promote public access throughout Finland, a policy of Yle's Director of Publications Ismo Silvo Yle on the news.
♪ Like us in the Tammelo era ♪
The speech has also been aroused by ridicule.
When evening comes, dinner will be enjoyed well in time, the children will be combed and dressed best.
My mom puts on a prettier cripple and my dad puts on a tie around his neck.
At 9:00 a.m., we turn off the TV like we used to in the Times of the Tammelos," writes the blogger Saku Timonen.
"Will Prime Minister Sipilä also tell us in his speech why the Finnish government is sitting in tax havens with millionaires hiding their capital in order to draft amnesty laws for other tax evaders while at the same time claiming to the people that it is necessary to cut off the government when the money is gone?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
Of what Sipilä says, one guess is presented by the Green Left Viva of the University of Tampere.
On Facebook, it has published the bingo included.
Do we hear about the same boat, the same coal, living in debt and team spirit tonight?
Ready the coupons and pens, at 9.05 p.m. it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Arena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: The Western countries rejected Russia's proposal to overthrow al-Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected Russia's offer to dissuade Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power, says President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian UN ambassador proposed a plan that, after some time, al-Assad would have left power elegantly.
However, the Western countries did not take up the proposal because they believed that al-Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
In 2012, Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed three plans in a bilateral debate: no arms to the opposition, immediate contact between the opposition and al-Assad, and the abolition of al-Assad's power had to be carried out with restraint.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on all things, but we are able to have an open debate.
I told him what I was doing there and he said sit down, Martti, and I'll tell him what we have to do, Ahtisaari will remember in the Guardian interview.
The diplomats are not commenting.
Ahtisaari tells us that he sent a message from Tshurkin to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion, but according to Ahtisaari, there are no two words about it.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said that al-Assad's troops had already committed several massacres at that time, and the main opposition groups refused any agreements that would have left him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former director of the Middle East Department of the British Foreign Ministry, is hesitant about what Ahtisaari said because, according to his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest part of Ahtisaari's claim is that Tshurkin spoke under Moscow authority.
If he had told me about what Mr Tshurkin said, I would have said that I wanted to hear the same thing from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, even in that case, he would have suspected that it was Putin's trick to keep power with some supporter of Al-Assad.
The flow of refugees is what we've done.
During the negotiations of the Ahtisaari, some 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
According to UN estimates, the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have had to flee their homes because of war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own doing.
I see no alternative but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we ourselves caused," Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
Centre for the organisation of asylum seekers in Tornio
The government's plan for the organisation of asylum seekers in Northern Finland is likely to be set up in Tornio.
The center would be set up in an empty building in the city center of Tornio.
The Ministry of the Interior has sought a suitable place to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
The Helsingin Sanomat reports on Tuesday that the council had already decided to present the school building as a space solution for the Ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppinen (left), Vice-President of the City Council of Tornio, this is not true.
When the whole council was not assembled and some of the group wanted a formal decision, we decided to invite the council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he will specify to the STT.
There were 36 delegates from 43 at the conference.
Thirteen delegates were opposed to the Arrangement Centre.
Based on this, one could expect a positive decision," says Professor Hyöppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday and responded quickly.
There are an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is 200 meters from the border, so it would work in that sense too," says Nousiainen.
Sipilä still wants an alternative to blackmail from the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä, half of the holiday money in public would only cover part of the government's efforts to reduce the price of work.
However, the government will be happy to take the alternative package with him if the social partners manage to agree on it.
In Parliament Sipilä told journalists that he had not been in contact with the social partners.
He also did not know how seriously organisations were looking for compensatory measures for the blackmail of working life announced by the government.
If such an agreement arises, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä's view, halving holiday money would be a viable means, since it would target almost all employees, unlike, for example, the government's plan to cut Sunday supplements.
Labour market organisations could agree among themselves on a cut in holiday money because it is enshrined in collective agreements rather than in the law.
On Wednesday next week, the government will tell the Parliament about the tensions in working life in the form of a Government statement.
According to Sipilä, the proposals made by the organisations should be known before then.
This is not the final deadline either.
Legislative work will then start, i.e. the train will be on the move and it will become increasingly difficult.
Now's a good time.
It won't take long for things like this to happen if there's a will, Sipilä formulated.
The list published by the government last week includes, among other things, the conversion of the Epiphany and Helatorsta into unpaid holidays without shortening the annual working hours.
In addition, the salary of the first days of illness is cut, overtime is halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
Reforms are being implemented as mandatory legislation past trade unions, which has been strongly criticised.
In addition to organising a major demonstration on Friday, wage earners' associations have announced political strikes by several trade unions.
Tohmajärvi Board of Governors approved the expansion of the sap hall warehouse
The Board of Directors of Tohmajärvi unanimously approved the expansion of the warehouse of the administration of Nordic Koivu Oy, a little murmuring.
The criticism was caused by the fact that the project was bigger and more expensive than originally discussed.
Also, a busy schedule is heartbroken.
It was wondering, too, that the need for space was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this stage, stock expansion of 400-450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but the money will be decided later in the interim report.
There was still talk of an investment between EUR 150 000 and EUR 200 000 on the agenda, but at the meeting the technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it brings work and tax revenue to the local community.
The municipality has no risk since the company pays for the investment as a rental," Vesa Väistö (ps.) explained.
There is also room for Karelian language in Joensuu
The city government relaxed its earlier sharp stance on bringing street name signs in Karelian into the city center of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct in view of the maintenance of the Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of the Karelian language because there are no historical grounds for it and the Karelian language is not an inherent part of the region's identity.
The language spoken in the area of Joensuu has been more a part of the eastern savorian dialects.
After a new decision there will be no street name signs in the city center in Karelian.
However, on a case-by-case basis, the City of Joensuu is also ready to use Karelian language in information boards and tourism marketing, for example.
The same approach is recommended by the city to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, it is also worth taking a wide-ranging view of the use of Karelian language now that multiculturalism lives and changes strongly in North Karelia.
Karelian language is still a special feature of the province, as well as the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of Finland.
Both of them can well be used in the various marketing activities of the province.
Shutting down rail links reduces the vitality of the province
Train lines cuts strike the vitality of the province with a hard hand.
Transport links have a direct impact on the region's business and competitiveness.
And that affects the fact that we can live and work here at all, Joensuu Mayor Kari Karjalainen wonders.
He also raises the issue of air transport, which has also been followed up on several occasions.
It is important for the whole region that our chances are not reduced by government measures, as is happening now.
We should look at the impact of these closures on employment, for example," Karjalainen stresses.
The deterioration of transport connections poses an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better services here, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees," says Jukka Mönkkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor access also affects the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot because of research.
Recruiting Manager Marko Junkkarinen says that marketing the university towards Western Finland is already difficult because the connections are weak in the transverse direction.
About half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland currently come from outside Eastern Finland.
On the other hand, about 10-20 per cent of them are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by direct train connections.
Joensuu's one gravel sound came to your court
The view of the City Council of Joensuu on the provincial Siun sote project is seemingly unanimous, but one of the gravel sounds is.
At the board meeting on Monday, Pentti Keskisalo, a member of the City Council (sd., picture), presented a proposal to abandon the entire project, but his presentation was unsuccessful.
The Board approved a draft decision by Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be revised at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will give a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train shift from Kouvola to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger train traffic from Kotka to Kouvola will continue in the future, although less than one train crew.
There will be changes in passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One train crew misses, but still five times a day gets from Kouvola to Kouvola and vice versa.
The contractions are the result of government austerity measures.
The purchase of train transport by the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four years will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely stopped.
VR will draw up new timetables by the end of the year.
They will enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed up on the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys snuck out.
The rescue department let a 12-year-old climbing up the roof, who couldn't get off the roof on his own.
The situation arose in Tornionmäki on Ketotie at half past six on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house where there is no ladder to the roof.
It did not prevent a group of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the radio amateur mast next to it.
The other boys got down the same way, but one didn't.
As a result, others sneaked out and passersby alerted the rescue department to help with the betting darts the last one left on the roof safely back on the ground.
FedEx's operating profit is twofold, decreasing prospects for the tax year 2016
FedEx reported depressing results in its latest quarter, and the delivery giant cut its performance forecast for the whole year, due to reduced demand for cargo services and higher costs for its land services.
The company also said that it intends to hire about 55 000 seasonal workers during holidays.
This time last year, FedEx announced that it was hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
Its share fell by about 2.5 per cent at the opening auction 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening clock.
FedEx Corp. says that it expects next May to end the tax year with a result of $10.40-10.90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
The analysts were expecting $ 10.84, according to a factset survey.
The lower outlook came despite an average price increase of 4.9%, which will enter into force on 4 January, and despite higher additional charges for the land transport of heavy or large packages starting in November.
The company said that it expects the operating profit to continue to grow from the previous year because they have cut costs, the turnover has increased and the online store is growing.
The president and CEO, Fred Smith, said that the company "will be able to perform steadily, taking into account less favourable economic conditions than expected, especially in production and global trade."
The plans for salaries during the holiday were announced the day after the competitor UPS announced that he was going to hire 90-95 000 extra employees, about the same as it did last year.
In the quarter ending on 31 August, FedEx's result was $692 million, which is 6 per cent more than last year.
The profit per share came to $2.42, leaving a $2.44 average forecast. 12 analysts surveyed Zacks Investment Research.
Net sales rose by 5 per cent to USD 12.3 billion.
In Zack's poll, six analysts were expecting $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a reduction in international priority transport, which has halted the development of the turnover of the Express unit.
However, the rise in e-commerce has improved the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the net sales of the country unit rose by 29 per cent, but the revenue from operations was basically the same due to the high costs of larger packages and own insurance.
The revenue of the Express unit was better due to higher basic fees, while operating profit in freight operations decreased by higher labour costs.
At the opening auction, about an hour before the opening clock, FedEx's shares decreased by $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $15.15.
On Tuesday, FedEx closed 11 percent down for this year and 17 percent below the 11 June record.
This week, the decision-makers of the Federal Reserve are sitting around a huge mahogany table for two days at a long awaited meeting to decide whether the time has come to raise the key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
At the other end of the central bank's decorative two-storey meeting room is a mural from the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation above everything else.
The Congress has laid on the central bank a dual responsibility: they must maximise employment in the United States and keep prices stable.
However, since the great recession, the central bank leaders have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: economic stability.
It is precisely this third requirement that can be a decisive factor in the decision to be published on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted; the decision whether the US economy is ready to be weaned on a record incentive which, until the end of 2008 , has been brought by short-term interest rates that have remained almost zero .
While most of the data show a steady economic growth, recent turmoil in global financial markets may have made the central bank officials, already on guarded in advance, even more frightened when it comes to increasing instability, fearing what would happen if the federal fund rate were raised by at least one percentage point per quarter.
"The labour market and inflation are the first and most important issues to be monitored," says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economic expert at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I believe that if they are looking for justification for the restoration of interest rates, increased uncertainty on the world market is a valid reason to wait," he says.
There has been no agreement on the decision of the central bank, which is already causing nervousness in the economy.
According to a recent study by Bloomberg, about half of financial experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
On the other hand, the financial markets expect the central bank to delay the withdrawal, as the key indicator suggests that the potential for growth is only about 30%.
This refers to a decline in the securities market if the central bank does not raise the level unless the decision-makers succeed in softening the impact by promising that the next withdrawal will not take place in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent, with a new figure of 16 599.85.
The recovery was accompanied by the expectation that the central bank will keep the level unchanged this week," says John Lonski, chief financial expert at the Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It's surprising if the central bank raises interest rates right now," he says.
If the decision-makers raise interest rates, "they will have to make a great deal of effort in their policy to support the financial markets so that they do not panic."
Other experts argue that an elevated level would calm the financial markets as it would eliminate uncertainty as to when the central bank will operate.
Only a month ago, it seemed that the Central Bank would be increasing interest rates by a quarter percentage point this month, thus taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of the monetary situation that would ensure the stability of the recovery in the United States.
Mr Yellen has said in the spring and early summer that he expects the level to rise this year despite the fact that the Liberals are calling for more economic development in their complaints.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
Last month the unemployment rate fell to 5.1%, which is the lowest in seven years and close to the level that the Central Bank considers to be the limit of full employment.
The increase in wages has shown signs of picking up.
Although inflation is still below the central bank's 2% annual target, the main reason for this, according to the central bank's decision-makers, is the temporary impact of lower oil prices.
The economy "is clear about higher interest rates and also needs them in view of the tight labour market situation," says Ian Shepherdson, chief financial expert at Pantheon Macro-Economics.
However, the financial markets around the world were shaken last week when China devaluations its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average decreased by as much as 16% of its record in May, when investors feared that China would slow down the economy also in the face of global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now nearly 10% below the peak in May.
For central bank decision-makers, market turmoil is an additional factor in a complex equation that tells us when interest rates need to be raised.
"Without these events on the financial markets and recent weeks' news of the weakness of the Chinese economy, the decision-makers would tighten the level at this meeting," says Stephen D. Oliner, UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Central Bank official.
Now he predicts that decision-makers will wait at least a month to get a better idea of the effects.
"The potential impact on the US economy is still quite unclear and they have little information at their disposal as regards the consequences of the events in China," says Oliver.
The welfare of the international economy is not the central bank's main concern, so in principle it should not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Central Bank has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the Central Bank has been immense.
In 2013, the hint of the then president, Ben S. Bernanken, that the Central Bank could "climb" the amount of money was causing upheavals in the markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interwoven, central bank officials are expected not only to follow developments elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The decision-making process of the Central Bank is "more art than science," says Zachary Karabell, Head of the Global Strategy of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Laker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of the State of Virginia, Richmond, pointed out this month that "the central bank has previously overreacted to financial market movements that seem to be separate from economic fundamentals'.
The Federal Open Market Committee has requested an increase in interest rates, and Mr Lacker, a member entitled to vote in the Committee, is an example of the 1998-99 decisions.
The Asian economic crisis caused the Central Bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 percentage points during three meetings "without worrying about its limited, identifiable impact on US economic growth," says Laker.
One year later, the Central Bank canceled these cuts.
The central bank should give priority to financial stability only during a major crisis, as the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's Committee for the Determination of Interest.
The latest turmoil is nowhere near its level," Posen says.
"Nobody wants a situation where interest rate increases are feared because the market is upset," says President Posen of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a dual requirement and does not mention financial stability; as long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

Brazil's Children's Disease Organization in Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet for breast-feeding
The Brazilian Children's Disease Organization (SPRS) has invented a shocking way to try to make women understand the importance of good food during breast - feeding by publishing pictures of babies sucking breasts that have been painted descriptions of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which give babies all the nutrients needed to develop a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that increasing calorie intake is not the only diet change that mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Professor Robert Waterland of Baylor College of Medicine in Texas revealed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genetic expression of their babies and protects babies from tumour development.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the child's immune system.
The Sunrise programme of the Seven channel is a favorite in the audience, despite Nine channel's attempts to report a director report in the Today Show program.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's rush to Canberra to report the aftermath of the Liberal Party's executive exposure failed to increase the number of admissions to Today.
The morning program for the Nine channel was broadcast from the capital of the country after Malcolm Turnbull took Tony Abbott out of power.
The competing program Sunrise, led by David Koch and Samantha Army, was stuck in London as part of its week-long series of international broadcasts covering Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The weight of the distance did not seem to affect Australian TV viewers, since Sunrise's average viewer average was 397 000 in five state capitals compared with 339 000 in Today's.
Today's average rose slightly compared to Monday's (317,000) and last Tuesday's (283000), but it was still lower than last Thursday's (343,000).
Today's been catching up with Sunrise over the last few months.
In August, the average for Today was 318,000 and for Sunrise 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varied between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
So far in September, Sunrise's average is 349 000 admissions, while Today's average is 314 000.
This is the most interesting event all morning.
The winds are blowing this morning away from Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

The great news of the Seven channel was the 800 word series of former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson, an amazing first performance.
The new drama series, which collected an impressive average of 1,219 million viewers, tells of a recently widowed father who decides to move to New Zealand with his two children.
The critics have wondered if Thomson is the most popular of the series to carry alone without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave him real certainty.
Seven channel The X Factor was a strong favorite for its 1.136 million spectators, easily winning The Block series (838 000) and TBL Families series (726 000).
Seven was the second night of The Chase Australia.
Andrew O'Keefe's first half hour of the new game show (17-17.30) gathered 446 000 viewers.
The second half hour (17.30-18) rose to 623 000 admissions - which was a small enough victory for Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat programme (613 000).
On Monday evening, the Chase Australia's first half-hour watcher averaged 520 000 admissions, while on the second half hour the number was staggering 720 000.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second night average drop will give the Nine channel confidence that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular program at 5.30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute programme, which failed to reduce the number of viewers in McGuire.

The final trio agrees with the fathers that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
The secret has been revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally revealed who's gonna win The Bachelor.
The identity of the woman has been kept extremely secret with whom Sam Wood ends up in The Bachelor.
The three remaining girls are certainly not slipping who got the last rose.
However, when discussing with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Flows the day before the three became two, they could inadvertently give a clue about the winner's identity.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's finals.
All three women became poetic when they told how Wood is a perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, ambition, family value, and positiveness as reasons why they would want to be his partner.
However, when they were asked, "If Wood's last rose is not for you, to whom should it go?" their answers could offer a revelation of who won the bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly mentioned Mackay as the best option for Wood after themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been uncomplicated since day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house, (Sarah's) energy and Sam's energy seemed quite compatible, and that thought was in my mind throughout the series," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is really earthy, it's fun to be around her," Markoski added.
I've seen them together and there's chemistry between them.
They seem to be comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a great match.
Mackay said that last week's house visits made him realize that Wood could be the real one.
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game - I am now wholeheartedly involved in this," he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say," he said.
I like the remaining girls just as much, so it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday at 7.30 p.m. on the Ten Channel.

Jarryd Hayne has many options where to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle were both very interested after he moved to the United States, and many other teams have asked about him since his impressive open day of training at the end of last year.
However, Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers team as well as Coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game after this convert from the Australian rugby league dropped the ball in his first flight kick return when the team won Minnesota by 20-3 on Tuesday.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and let Hayne return the next flight kick and took him in after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula's true nature was also seen in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of calling his newcomers a battalion in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at the post-game press conference.
49ers specialist Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised her to forget about the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped the kick that Minnesota Vikings picked up in the first quarter of the game.
This really wasn't the beginning that Hayne and his numerous Australian fans wanted for the man's NFL debut.
Hayne was seen cursing on the way from the airport after the drop, and later he told the Australian radio team Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM channel at 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start for his NFL career.
"It was just one of these things, you just have to think about the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared his groping to his 2007 Origin debut when the feed in his own paint area led to Queensland goal.
All in all, it was still a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed to her Instagram account in a photo with fans holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at gunpoint on a Siberian runway.
Mr Khodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was seized and his efforts to support democracy were restricted.
4 killed while police were shooting rubber bullets at protestors in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, died in southern Nepal after a policeman shot rubber bullets in a crowd that protested against the country's new draft Constitution, the authority announced on Wednesday.
Violence took place on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh region about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the region's highest official, said that more than 1,000 protesters had been gathered outside the police station and some of them were throwing stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty cops and five civilians were injured, he told me.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, known to have killed but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, seemed to have caused so many deaths.
The conflict was the latest in weeks of violent demonstrations across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of the ethnic group called Madhesi say that the new provinces set up under the proposed new constitution undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in Western Nepal when the Tharus Group demands its own state.
Since 10 August, at least 40 people have died in violent confrontations, of which 11 have been police officers.
At that time, the four main parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - this is a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has had central government for centuries.
The new constitution has been planned since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
This week the legislators have voted on the draft Constitution in Katmandu, and the authorities have said that the new Charter could be adopted by Sunday.
United States National Hurricane Center NHC says that south of Cape Verde has a 60% chance of a hurricane
The wide low pressure front, located about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde island group, has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical hurricane in the next 48 hours, reported the U.S. National Hurricane Center on Tuesday.
Another precise low-pressure front, halfway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles, also has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical tornado in the next two days," added the weather forecast centre in Miami.
Google launches a donation campaign aimed at collecting 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) launched a donation campaign aimed at collecting 11 million dollars for humanitarian organisations helping thousands of refugees from Europe fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal perspective when publishing a donation campaign in his blog.
Instead of notifying the director, Google's employee Rita Masoud, who fled with her family from Kabul at the age of seven, wrote about his personal experience.
"Our journey consisted of numerous dark train and bus journeys, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But when the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has increased, people like my family are desperate to help.
Donations receive four non-profit organisations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google told us that it will be equal to every donation made worldwide on Google.com/refugeeelief up to $5.5 million, with a total target of $11 million.
Europe is experiencing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, mainly due to the four years of civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people out of their homes this year.
Many are also fleeing from war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery may help mildly obese diabetics
According to a new study, the benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese type 2 diabetics may last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics live longer after weight loss surgery than those treated in other ways than surgery.
"It takes a long time to obtain mortality data," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery who wrote an editorial for a new study in JAMA Surgery.
Different methods are used to reduce the size of the stomach during diet surgery.
They reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, Baratric surgery has been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the subjects in the study have been morbidly obese and their body mass index (BMI) has been 35 or more.
The BMI, i.e. the ratio of weight to length, is considered normal when it is between 18,5 and 24,9.
If BMI is over 25, it indicates that someone is overweight and if a person is over 30, they are considered obese.
You can count your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used the data collected from 2007 to compare two types of baratric surgery, gastric bypass surgery and gastric reduction, with type 2 diabetes medications in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of cut persons fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, BMI remained broadly the same in 29 persons treated with non-operative methods.
Thirty-six percent of the cut persons had complete and 28 percent had partial diabetes improvement.
By comparison, in the treatment group, the overall improvement in diabetes was only 1% and partly about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and the "evil" LDL-C "were generally better in the surgical group," the writers noted.
Scientists also monitored patients for haemoglobin levels of A1c in their blood, which reflect blood sugar levels in the long term.
Hemoglobin A1c should remain below 7%, researchers write.
Post-operative haemoglobin levels of A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the therapeutic group it remained stable at approximately 8%.
However, this better "glycaemic control," as described by improved haemoglobin levels A1c, did not reduce mortality over five years," says chief researcher Dr Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The study group also compared average results between two different types of surgery.
At the fifth year, when compared with a gastric reduction group, a gastric bypass group had lost more body weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), a higher reduction in its body mass index (74 and 5.1), a higher reduction in haemoglobin levels than its A1c levels (3.1% and 2.1%), and was more likely to achieve complete diabetic remission (46.9%) and 16.7%.
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix Blackstone says that although research does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are results from Sweden, where surgery led to longer lives for the heavier people.
A Swedish study found that obesity in weight loss surgery was 29 percent less likely to die over a period of 15 years when compared with a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not show any improvement in the survival of surgical patients, Blackstone says that the results are nevertheless encouraging for people with BMI less than 35 who are interested in surgery.
"Research results are crucial precisely because they show that surgery is safe for a lower body mass index group" and does not involve an increased risk of death or kidney disease," he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously when patients are between 27 and 30.
"I think we'll wait too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that when a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it will be very difficult to reverse the situation.
"Not everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibet's Buddhism has called for an end to violence in refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the beginning of his ten-day visit to Britain, devoted to ethics research.
The Dalai Lama claimed that, in the present situation, the needs of all mankind should be put ahead of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that although the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is also inadequate.
"Not everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria in the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of many thousands of refugees, but in the meantime we have to think about long-term solutions: how to bring true peace and development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The ultimate thing is to think about how we can reduce killing in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In taking a stand on the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the violent response of the United States caused the violent events in the chain.
"After 9/11, I expressed my condolences to President Bush in his letter and told him that the solution to this problem could be found through non-violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and it created unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
During the last four years, children's ingestion of hand-diagnosing agents has increased fourfold.
Poisoning focal points across the United States have reported an increase of nearly 400% in the consumption of a strong alcohol-containing hand-diagnosing agent in children under 12 years of age since 2010, says Georgia's Poison Information Centre.
According to Dr Gaylord Lopez, the director of Georgia's Poison Information Centre, the cases of ingestion of disinfectants reported in poison control centres for children under 12 years of age increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"Children are interested in these products more often and unfortunately a certain percentage of them will end up on call," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant on purpose, while others want to impress their friends or respond to the challenge in social media.
There are videos on YouTube where teenagers drink disinfectant to get a cheap ups and downs.
According to reports, teenagers have mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
Pleasant fragrances of disinfectant can attract younger children.
"The kid doesn't think this is bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (handicrafts) are those to which the scent has been added.
There are disinfectants scented with strawberries, grapes and oranges that are very attractive to children.
Hand disinfectants may contain any alcohol between 45% and 95%.
In young children in particular, only a few squirts are needed for alcohol poisoning.
"It's really concentrated alcohol," Mr. Stephen Thornton told Fox 4, head of medical treatment at the University of Kansas Hospital Poison Information Centre in Kansas City.
So you wouldn't leave the whiskey shot lying on the table, but you leave the hand-defining agent out there, and if the kids are interested in it, it's a fast way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six - year - old girl who recently swallowed only four squirts of strawberry-scented hand disinfectants at school and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
His blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the limit of adult drunk driving, says emergency clinic doctor Chris Ritchey, who treated a girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was talking and couldn't walk when he arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors followed him overnight in a separate children's hospital for possible symptoms of brain damage, as alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head," Ritchey explained.
"It was really scary," Nhaiyah's mother Ortoria Scott said to CNN.
The situation could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or alcohol wipes and remove disinfectants from children's reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two ontario women died from ingestion of hand disinfectant containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
Health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a deadly substance and not ethyl alcohol, which had been declared as an active ingredient.
In January, in the northern part of New York state, three fourth - graders planned to poison their "evil" teachers by spreading bacterial poison into the classroom, reports a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand disinfectant and banned it from his class.
The police consider the plan to be "a idle nonsense" and leave disciplinary action to the school district.
Rumor mill: Celtic has no conflict
Griffiths disregards the talk of Celtic conflicts, and Deila admits that Hoops is in a tight spot, but she makes it turn around.
Hearts is fighting the Scottish Football Federation against Neilson's charges, and Warburton is on guard against January recruitments that can disrupt team unity.
Dons raised his lead to Celtic to five points.
Adam Rooney's first half penalty kick brought Aberdeen to a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium and enabled the team to increase the difference to five points in Celtic.
Griffiths is gonna play down the talk of conflict.
There have been rumors about Celtic's internal conflicts, but Griffiths immediately overtaken them. He claims that he and his teammates have no feeling of working under more detail when the team is preparing to meet the Dutch serial leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are waiting to meet.
The lack of a Scots Championship bores the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers middle field player and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition for a championship with the Rangers.
Ajax's current ambassador de Boer said: "In Holland no longer shows the highlights of Celtic games, and why?"
Because the Rangers aren't involved.
People here can't just talk about Ranger's return.
They're talking about the Old Firms.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
The games of these teams have a lot of tension, and also non-Scots want to watch them.
Deila swears she's gonna turn the situation around.
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn the situation around.
The loss to Malmö and its fall from the Champions League quickly resulted in a defeat for the ten-man Aberdeen, who is now at the top of the series at five points apart from the next.
But Deila said, "Celtic has had bad episodes before, and we're getting up again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know that this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
So are we, but we have to keep going.
We really need supporters because it improves players' performance.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton is on alert for January player transfers
Although Mr. Rangers' boss, Mark Warburton, just a few weeks ago, commented on possible targets for January player transfers, he is on guard against the most recruitmentist, assuring that he doesn't want to confuse the team with consensus.
The former boss of Brentford said: "The migration window of January is very different from the summer window."
For the players coming in the summer, the adjustment period is the entire previous period, which is reflected in our team this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can do more harm.
Celtic's Interest in Michu Insinuates Retirement
Swansea's attacker, Michu, whose name is attached to Celtic in connection with the transfer window, has suggested that he can retire after his contract with Swans ends.
For two years, a 29-year-old player has had ankle problems and failed to find new company outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts is ready to fight the Scottish Football Federation for Neilson's comments.
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team then lost 3-2. The defender's red card was later revoked, and this was already the third red card condemned by Collum in the last eight months, which was revoked.
Neilson stands by what he said, saying, "I didn't question honesty, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle.
The faithful Hibernian player was reprimanded for singing an insulting song about the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in Roseburn, Edinburg, before Edinburg derby at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was derby and it was a momentary impulse," the attacker added, "It's safe to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I go to Celtic."
Tannadice's government believes in Dundee United's leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee United government still has faith in the leadership team's ability to reverse the situation, but admits that the weakening of players must end.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're gonna get the boys back in shape," Donnelly says.
McInnes cheerful for the "ugly win" game in Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately hanging in the game against Hamilton Accies, but thanks to Adam Rooney's first half penalty kick, he managed to win his seventh consecutive league victory, which brought them to the top of the table with five points above Celtic.
McInnes says: "There is no team that won anything, whether it's a trophy or a league that wouldn't have won games in this way."
Unemployment in Scotland remains the same as the whole of Great Britain grows
UNEMPLOYMENT in Scotland remained in 164 000 people between May and July, while unemployment in the UK as a whole rose to a total of 1.82 million.
Scotland's unemployment rate is 5.9% higher than the UK's 5.5%, the figures of the National Statistical Institute (ONS) show.
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12 000 people over a three-month period, and the number of people employed now stands at 2 612 000.
Over the quarter, the employment rate in Scotland fell to 74%, which is higher than the average in Great Britain at 73.5%.
Scottish State Secretary David Mundel commented on these latest figures: "The government's long-term plan is to build a basis for a stronger economy."
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of Great Britain.
Over the past 12 months, the Scottish labour market has improved, employment has increased and unemployment has fallen.
Why am I witnessing an execution in Oklahoma?
If there is no legal intervention at all, later today I will watch a man executed.
If so, and I hope not, I will sit in the audience gallery at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary prison watching Richard Glossip be executed with a lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
I accepted the request in January through his best friend, and although shocked, I agreed.
I'm starting to freak out about this day as it gets closer.
So why did I say yes?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
Of course, journalists have the opportunity to follow executions in America, and since there are often more applications than free seats, the participants are selected through an appalling lottery.
Oklahoma has reduced media reserved seats from twelve to five.
Whoever's elected is watching the event cool.
I can't do it.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have also made my own connection to him through calls made over the months and one two- and-a-half-hour visit.
I like him.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
Prison officials say I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I can't have a notebook and pen with me to save what I see.
All I have to do is try to remember all the details.
On Twitter, an Oklahoma journalist accused me of compromising my neutrality.
Here's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants you to be involved.
I complained to the reporter.
The wedding admitted that "you could have done better with your words," but you still think what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I've told him that he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants there to be an international journalist here to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help the trend against the death penalty.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is right next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, you can listen to a series of podcasts I've made.
I'm not going to go over all the details again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would in any case make him guilty of aid.
But I think there's a very strong chance that he's not guilty of murder.
I am sure that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think it's wrong to execute him.
And this is the point of view I'm looking at him dying from.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
There will be other journalists who will take care of it.
I'll give you a description of what it's like to watch a man I like die unnecessarily.
The man was lured out of the Canning River after a watery police chase.
Canning Vale's officer stayed dry when he lured him out of the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to distract the police went wrong when he found himself in a shallow muddy water just feet away from a policeman who tried to "lure him gently back to the beach."
Canning Vale police were called to Beckenham on Tuesday for trespassing.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to distract them by heading for the Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
"He was standing in the water saying, "I'm not coming out, come get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to get wet, so he used a safer tactic: a proper police conference.
"Sometimes people do funny things trying to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Master football player Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing and tried to swim across the river Swan River.
He did not succeed, but inspired the locals to start planning the playful Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that his agents tried to spy on him and threatened to stop competing.
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria's operatives tried to infiltrate their spies in his stables last year and threatens to stop competing immediately.
He blames the agents and the Racing Victoria Integrity Division, claiming that they have a personal campaign against him. On Wednesday, Lady Tatain's late rejection due to the treatment procedure on the day of the race was the last staple.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for competition and that he has been in a difficult situation since Lidar's inexplicable positive cobalt sample.
He's been keeping his tongue in check on spy claims for a year and a half, and he didn't want it to look like jealousy.
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so frustrated that everything goes out at once," Moody said.
They knew the situation was continuing.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I've said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk with my head up, and I want the owners to think that I'm doing my best for them.
When they start to think differently, then I'm not supposed to continue as a coach anymore.
Then I'd have to think about what I'm gonna do with my license.
In the past, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview with racing.com where he told me that the integrity department had been trying to spy on his stable.
"Fifteen years ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - I will name him when asked - and offered him a job at my stables if he would pass on information about what I was doing there.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, then they should fire their lawyers because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current president of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of this at that time and are aware of it today.
Am I supposed to start thinking this is getting personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to man up and perhaps pass on responsibility to other than coaches as to what is going on in this field?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I that bad for the business?
Maybe that's what people think.
Perhaps they need to take my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that the things I am saying now may make them think about it.
But now I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, and that makes me sad.
It really saddens me.
I'm putting pressure on them to make a decision that's their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach's frustration has increased with a long-term study of Lidar cobalt, and the late rejection led him to conclude that he could "throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known for the training of the undefeated champion Black Caviar, has called the rules on day-to-day care "laughter" after the mud or clay bath has been placed on the feet of the horse, which is illegal.
"It's against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it," he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put mud on his leg.
It could have had a grave last night.
It could have had it yesterday, just like it was.
He had it on the day of the race.
Moody may face a three-month non-compete for day-to-day tomb care, where officials started an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Arrested driver responsible for driving in Cobram
The police have arrested a man who was forced to flee after he ran into a cyclist this weekend in Cobram.
The biker was transported by air to Royal Melbourne Hospital after serious injuries when the car hit him on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
The police reported that the driver drove away and didn't stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man named Nathalia reported to the police himself in Shepparton.
He will be accused of not stopping in an accident, of failing to provide assistance, and of other traffic offences.
The biker, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in the hospital and is stable.
Melbourne Storm team coach Craig Bellamy attacks rivals in wrestling claims
Craig Bellamy, Melbourne Storm's coach, has criticized the master of two NRL rugby leagues for claiming that his team's tackles are part of the "plan."
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said that the referees allowed Storm to "wrestle" on his own side when it suddenly won the final qualifying in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely hid his reference to Storm after he won the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night in final qualifying. Bennett called the game the rugby league's "show window" and said that two Queensland teams weren't "very excited" wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's tackles and said they were just focusing on "contact" when they tackled.
Bellamy added that his confidence was increased by two leading coach criticism of Storm, which means that they are afraid of losing to the team.
"This always comes up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we lost to them 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we haven't changed anything in our defense systems or techniques all year long, and over the past six weeks, we've just been putting a lot of emphasis on contact in tackles, and that's what's made us successful.
Trent has been on the team for three years and obviously has a great team to train, so he's probably not used to losing, and this was a little shock to him.
It's funny how it always comes up this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting rugby" by reminding his mentor that the St George Illawarra Dragons coached by Bennett won the championship in 2010 by playing boringly.
Wayne's talking about an exciting rugby.
He felt it was important to compare Saturday night's game with our Friday night game and tell him how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember 2010 when St George was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn't care less.
But now he has a team that can play the kind of rugby we find exciting, especially when he has fast young friends.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have that type of player.
He brought it up in 2010, now he wants everyone to play rugby from his style - not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play that way.
I become more confident when they say such things because they are a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as a resistance to important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and Roosters was more pointy than the game between Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was certainly a good game, I haven't looked at it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two more goals but is it exciting rugby?
Or is it a violation of an exciting line of defense and a failure to score a goal?
For me, it's all about the lines.
If they mention us, it means there's a point where we can play against them.
Storm is free this weekend because they have already won the right to a home game against either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronu Sharks for next Saturday night's pre-final in Aami Park. Tickets will be on sale next Tuesday morning.
$200,000 bail for a Serb man on a drug charge.
A man facing a possible life sentence for an attempted possession of 40 kilos of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released against $200,000 in bail.
The 29-year-old Marko Maximovic is one of five men who was arrested last month after the federal police had traced 100 kilos of drugs to the Solay hunt, which came to South America through Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maximovic was seen meeting other defendants at the marina all morning, and then he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse café where the police found 40 kilos of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Although Maximovic threatens a possible life sentence for an attempt to hold the amount of cocaine in the business, his lawyer claimed that there is no evidence that Maximovic tried to hold the whole amount and that he may have been in the cafeteria for absolutely innocent reasons.
Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maximovic was trying to escape.
"He has close ties with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal court case, Maximovic lied to the police about where he lived.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather had jointly offered $200,000 in bail to secure his release.
"After reading the sworn certificates of both persons, it is clear that setting a guarantee of $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
But alone it wasn't enough to stop him from appearing in court, he warned.
Maximovic was granted bail on the condition that he surrenders his passport to both Australia and Serbia, reports to the police daily and maintains his curfew between 6 a.m. and 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used her phone to lure paedophiles to send pictures.
The pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took her phone while she was sleeping and then logged in to an online communications service where Hogg received numerous immoral pictures of the children sent to her by another user.
She woke up later, found that the phone was missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
She searched her phone and found shocking messages, and immediately told her mother.
When the police arrived, they saw five photos, searched the computers on the scene, and found "disquieting" web searches using search words used to search for immoral images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this "to tempt paedophiles" on the Internet before he "professed to be a cop to scare them" .
Eilidh Robertson, representative of the Fiscal Depute, told Dundee's Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he depended on scaring people.
He admitted that he had done the searches on the computer but said that they were only done because he wanted to pretend to be a cop so he could scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with an unknown person who sent him the photos, as well as when Hogg asked him to send additional pictures.
Hogg said he only did this for bait purposes.
He said that when he drank, he had a sick head, and he wanted to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added: "When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she shouted at her mother, shook and cried.
My mother saw the indecent photos on the phone and then confronted the accused.
She was interviewed, and she told me that the defendant had used a computer and a Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
A 23-year-old Hogg, who lives on Ward Road in Dundee, admitted his guilt for making or taking pictures of immoral children on 14 June last year. He broke his bail on 25 January of this year and failed to appear before the court on 24 March of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be entered in the sex offenders' register because it could be claimed that his crime did not contain a "significant sexual element."
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the sentence until October so that the social services have time to prepare the background reports.
Hogg was given bail in this case, but in other ongoing cases, he's under arrest before the hearing.
He was added to the sex offenders' register before the day of the conviction.
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe gave the wrong speech to Parliament
The oldest leader of Africa, Mugabe, fell earlier this year on the stairs leading to the podium.
He didn't get hurt, but the video of the crash spread like a virus on social media.
Parliament's opening ceremony was also tainted by opposition legislators' claims that anonymous death threats had been sent to them to warn them not to boo Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they booed and cut him off in the middle of his speech on the state of the country to Parliament - which he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) group curator Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interfere with Mugabe's speech.
"The number from which the message was sent is not responding, but the message is entitled 'death'," Gonese told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
The message warned the relevant Members that immunity would end in Parliament, and when they stepped out, parliamentary immunity would not apply.
The supervisor of group discipline said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is "disquieted" about threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut 25 000 to 30 000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in business services.
Later this year, HP will be divided into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer business from the faster growing corporate hardware and service activities.
Expected job cuts bring with them the cost of about $2.7 billion, starting in the fourth quarter," HP's release said.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, Chairman of HP and Managing Director, who will lead the unit after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focussed than the current HP, and we will have a wide and deep range of services that will help companies move into new business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to respond to the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual turnover will be over $50 billion and "focuss on producing unparalleled integrated technology solutions" for companies, says the company's release.
The division breaks down a company that was founded in the 1930s by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, who graduated from Stanford University University, in order to manufacture electrical supplies.
HP has undergone a huge restructuring to cope with the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the world's second largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the USA, and its distribution is the latest in a sector based on the belief that strictly limited companies perform better.
Captain Mikel Arttata of Arsenal says that teammates must support injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb's tie.
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is only September and assuming that his rehabilitation is going according to plan, there is no reason why he should not be playing again by Christmas.
Even in this best case, Wilshire will miss at least four more games in England, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will be attending next summer's European championship.
The biggest pity in this latest problem is that Wilshere's end of last season was strong after a single ankle injury, and he remembered his old sharpness before the season began.
"This kind of injury doesn't threaten a career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing weird.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also admitted, when a player tries to return in the middle of the season there is always a risk of additional injuries.
There is also an uncomfortable pattern in the process of formation.
Studies by Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilshere has had 23 different injuries since he debuted six years ago.
In addition, during the last five seasons he has played Arsenal from 157 league games in only 65 games.
Looking at Arsenal's wider picture after the 2007-08 season, in six of the eight seasons it has been one of the Valoliiga teams that has lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger admits the possibility of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that their improvement in the injury statistics for the last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you return from the injury may be prone to a period when you need to strengthen your body and acquire competition," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure it will, and that he can make the career he deserves.
Wenger is preparing to recycle his team when Arsenal starts his Champions League game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then on Saturday against Chelsea and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arta are likely to be in the start.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroudin with Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to maintain balance and give a break to the players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear follow-up favorite of the F-block, it is one of the most frightening in Europe at the Maximir Stadium Zagreb.
Dinamo has also not lost in 41 matches since they produced their own "Invincible" campaign last season.
The stadium was quakeed on Tuesday night by an earthquake of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned from the surrender of the Champions League last season against Monaco, and he is still motivated by the distant dream of leading the team to its first European Cup victory.
"This motivation is huge," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I can be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about man-to-man friendship
It is striking that there are no similar descriptions in the series, especially given that the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rate for young men is higher than for fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to tackle the problem Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 men's year. The aim was to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
A recent study included more than 2,000 secondary school and upper secondary school students who showed symptoms of depression. According to the study, a person's chances of recovery doubled if the percentage of his friends were "healthy" enough.
Similarly, those who were not depressed were halved in the likelihood of possible mental problems if they had sound friends in mind.
But in order for friendship to work, it has to be available first.
In this time of social media communication, the style goes past the content and the indifference of the answer is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, joyful and successful, even though isolation actually dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All of this is done at the expense of internal values - internal desire for personal growth and friendship - which have a deeper impact on our mental health.
And as a billionaire video gaming developer recently explained, money certainly does not provide greater happiness.
The greatness of the Friends was that it turned this focus on its head.
None of the characters defined their work but rather their personality, which stood out clearly in interaction as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs watching football, Ross missing Rachel - their humor came from knowing that yes, men can relate to all this, although they often hesitate to explore their feelings completely.
As a volunteer from Samaritans explained to me: "I listen to people who are depressed and suicidal, I really understand how the slightest interaction with a friend can make them feel better."
Often men who contact us feel that they can't talk to friends.
The old idea of "overreach" is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up to problems, you are seen as weak.
Friends is one of those series that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term survival.
It emphasized the moments of man-to-man friendship.
Although my neutral, outside position at the other end of the phone helps people in times of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal network of family and friends.
And if you participate in the Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend, and all the locations have been redesigned to celebrate, why not take your friends for coffee at Central Perk.
Or, better yet, if you see someone lonely in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You'll never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, take part in #FriendsFest
Di Maria finishes and helps PSG slap Malmö to the side
Angel Di Maria celebrates goals against Malmö with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan.
Angel Di Maria scored in his debut of the Champions League, helping the PSG to bypass the Swedish team in Malmö on Tuesday.
Below is the match report and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started their Champions League game with a nice 2-0 win against Malmö at Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored the Champions League in her debut for less than four minutes, pointing the way to the French league champions, but the team lost a number of opportunities before finally adding their head start when Cavan scored 61 minutes.
Paris, which is in the same "A" section as Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish league champion, as the game was not only a sequel, but also an improvement in their quarter finals in the last three rounds.
But even though the PSG took the score, it wasn't a classic game, because Laurent Blanc's team Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost his seat in front of the goal and later switched from the field. Malmö is his old hometown team and the team where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win in the Champions League at home or in guests, so the 2-0 win will create problems for your opponent and look good in statistics, and it's a good start, even though there are things we're going to have to work on this season," Blanc said.
That's what's good for you.
We wanted to win and we won, even though I regret that we failed to score one or two more goals.
After the injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team in one of the three changes since the team was left in the 2-team league 1 home game against Bordeaux at the weekend, but he was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentinean winger was named a man who takes the PSG to a new level in Europe, and he testified why when he ran Marco Verratt's feed behind Malmö's defense line and then struck a beautiful finish by Johan Wiland in the back corner of the net.
However, if someone expected easy and big profits from the PSG, they were disappointed.
Malmö was a clogged opponent. It won Celtic's decision match when it reached this level, with nine international players and a five-man defense team and two players in the deep center.
But on the attack side, the team offered little more than Nikola Djurdjic's 34th minute shot, which barely passed Kevin Trapp's goalpost.
On the other hand, the PSG sometimes got into trouble because of lost feeds and poor finishing, especially from Ibrahimovic, who failed in five companies only during the first half and then was disappointed when Cavani put the ball in contact with Ibrahimovic right at the beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more effective in carrying out his preliminary work for his colleagues, and it was at the time of Mr Ibrahimovic's pitch that Di Maria sent a round kick that tilted around Wiland's goalpost at 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally achieved after an hour of the game, thanks to the Uruguay Cavan, who struck his sixth goal of the season, after Ibrahimovic had snapped Maxwell's cross pitch from the left.
That was the end of Malmö's hopes to get back into the game, and only Wiland's brilliant rejection of David Luiz's direct kick kept the final numbers down before the goal of Ezequiel Lavezz, which came out of the exchange, was rejected at the very end of the game.
Malmö's coach Age Hareide later admitted that the PSG was as high as his team. Norwegian said: "Our last game of the Champions League was last December."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which is not the same level.
It's not enough to try out.
I'm gonna put my hat on Paris.
This was a great game for them.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion for the sale of shares.
On Wednesday, the Swiss mining giant Glencore, who suffered a price collapse on basic goods, raised USD 2.5 billion by selling shares as part of its extensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, reported that he had sold new shares for about £1.6 billion to reduce his debt.
A company that lost 57% of its market value this year is struggling with the prices of collapsed commodities, as the slowdown in the Chinese economy is putting pressure on demand and causing damage on all markets.
The new entry raised the value of Glencore's shares to the top of the London Stock Exchange in the morning shops on Wednesday.
Shares rose by 2.77% to 131.60 pence in the FTSE 100 index, which opened at 0.69% higher.
The previous week, Glencore had exposed a $2.5 billion stock trade as part of its wider plan to cut its $30 billion debt burden by about a third.
The company sold new share capital for 125 pence shares, which meant a 2.4 per cent discount on Tuesday's closing price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares, which amounted to 9.99 per cent of the Group's total value.
Concerns about the long-standing halting of Chinese growth have cut iron ore prices by around half, while prices of coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40%.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
China's President Xi Jinping makes a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, a statement published by the White House on Tuesday confirmed.

Matt Damon minimizes the difference in filmmaking
Matt Damon brought together an African - American filmmaker named Effie Brown in discussing a difference that Damon says is not needed behind the scenes.
On Sunday evening at Project Greenlight, an experienced actor interrupted Brown, highlighting the need for different perspectives as regards the dark-skinned character of the selected manuscript.
"When we talk about diversity, it's taken into account when choosing actors for a movie, not a series," Damon claimed.
The shocked Brown reacted unbelievably, commenting "Wow. Okay," while The Martian actor's comments were hanging in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the finalists of the series.
"I want to encourage people to think, whatever the director is, how they treat Harmony's character," Brown said at the beginning.
The only dark character is the whore that his white pimp hits.
The producer of The Dear White People demanded the right to direct the film to the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon harshly replied that their guidance "could end up giving us something we do not want."
After the conversation was broadcast, the social media exploded to disapprove of Damon's comments.
The Twitter user, MrPooni, expressed his anger at the film game, writing: "Matt Damon talking to the only dark-skinned person in the room and explaining to him the difference is SO LIGHT that it happens."
After its release, Tweeting collected over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon's comments coincide with a precise racial presentation in the media at the forefront of social debate.
Following the killing of a teenage Michael Brown by the white police in 2014, The Black Lives Matter spread nationwide and urged legislators and authorities to put an end to discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, the singer Prince referred to the movement when he presented the Year's Album candidates for the Grammy Prize.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
The leaders of the Black Lives Matter recently published a statement to answer the question of the Fox News television face Elisabeth Hasselbeck as to whether the group should be regarded as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," said the leaders.
It was recently reported that Damon is among the entertainers, producers, and media moguls invited to visit the pope to discuss the Catholic Church's image in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the pope.
First American Ninja Warrior Champion crowned
The professional rock climber and vessel collector Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and was awarded a million dollar prize.
The competition programme, which ended its seventh season, has never had a competitor who could have survived all the sections of the obstacle track.
In the final episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final round.
The last mission was to climb a 30-foot rope in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and settled the challenge on time, which made him the first athlete of all time to find out the exhausting fourth part of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero cleared the challenge three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after a difficult victory and was still in shock for winning the million dollar prize.
"Well, it's great to think that I've never made or lived for more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told Esaac! after his big raise.
So all of a sudden... I can't even imagine what this is gonna be like... the future is unknown.
Production Director Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the fiinal and why Britten doesn't get more reward money, even though he's the first ever competitor to pass the track.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
"If more people pass, the one with the fastest time will get the money," Weed said.
Even though money is a great reward and changes life, he gets a great sense of satisfaction.
I don't think that's why he feels resentful.
He's just so happy he's done what he did.
His fans have been praising him.
He's a great guy. He's a good family man.
He's a hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If anyone had to beat me, I'm happy it was Isaac."
And I believe Isaac would have thought the same way if it had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior returns to the eighth season, which will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers snuck past Minnesota Twins.
Minneapolis -- The other half of the season hasn't been very funny to Detroit Tigers.
Tigers was once one of the best baseball teams, but is now the last in the American League Central Division.
Tigers played his role as a ruiner perfectly on Tuesday when it won Minnesota Twins on the 5-4 Target Field.
Twins lost the chance to get up halfway from Houston Astros in a race for another wild card spot in the American League.
For Detroit, the game was for at least one night a return to the six-letter H word, which had been very difficult to reach for most of the second half of the season.
"All winnings are fun, no matter how you get them," said Team Leader Brad Austus of the Tigers.
Alfredo Simon, the pitcher of the Tigers, continued his early support for the attack when Detroit ran three times in the first two innings, and then one time in the sixth and one more in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 innings and released three runs.
This was only his third quality in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong ending for this year," said Simon.
It's hard for a changeman to pitch in every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Victor Martinez, Tiger's surrogate, hit three times and made it possible to run two races that were his first beats since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-stroke night since he hit Seattle Mariners four times on July 6.
"He waved the bat well," said Ausmus.
He looked good (at batting exercises), looked much better at batting exercises and continued the same model in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the second half of the seventh inning, and it was their best chance of getting back into the game.
Senteri Byron Buxton started the inning by hitting out twice on the left field line.
On the right side, Aaron Hicks settled down with a single nest, and Simon was able to burn the second nest player Brian Dozier directly before Simon was replaced with the left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only player who stood up to him, the first surrogate Miguel Said, who would rip the two-base run left of the right-handed Drew VerHagen.
With two runners in the field and a smoother on second base, VerHagen caused Trevor Pluffe to hit a double goal.
This was the record for the main series: 27th time this season Pluffe hit a double game.
After Detroit got a backup run at the ninth start, Mauer raced two beats against Bruce Rondon, Tiger's shutter, and the score was 5-4.
But the right-handed player burned the word in three pitches in his fifth salvation.
At the beginning, Detroit took advantage of Phil Hughes in rust.
Tigers got three runs in the first two innings against a right-handed veteran player who got off the list before the game after being out for more than a month due to low back inflammation.
"It's obvious that I didn't want to get started like this," Hughes said, "but as the game progressed, I felt more comfortable, and I felt like I got a few nice pitches in the third inning."
After Hughes grabbed the starter to the first base, he let the second base player, Ian Kinsler, move forward one-way.
J.D. Martinez's walking on the right side in a two-fire situation brought Victor Martinez to bat, who took himself to first base on the center pitch and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez cut his 0-21 tubes while the runners were in good running positions.
Third base player Nick Castellanos continued by hitting the right and creating a second run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was rejected as he tried to advance to third base.
Tigers continued in the second inning and got one fire, two nests in a run by the runner James McCann and two nests, one nest in a run by the center Anthony Gosel, after which the situation was 3-0.
"It was an important punch," said Twins' team leader Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but it flew to the right place.
Hughes began to feed and fed the runless third inning, after which he was replaced by the right-handed follower A.J. Achter.
Three runs were calculated for Hughes for six strokes and a walk for four.
NOTE: Tiger's right-handed pitcher Anibal Sanchez was thrown away due to a shoulder sprain.
He's being investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of injured persons since mid-August due to a shoulder tremor, but he had to return on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is out, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris is coming from the injured list to begin with against Twins.
Norris's statistics in the Tigers are 1-1 in four starts after David Price, the left-handed pitcher, was switched to him on July 30.
Norris has been out since August 20th because of the right slanting of the abs.
The series of three games by Tigers and Twins ends on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2-, 4.43 ERA) stands up against Ervin Santana, the right-handed pitcher of Minnesota (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for a wider economy for the world
The economy must open up more to the outside world in order to promote growth," President Xi Jinping told the group on Tuesday to guide reform.
"China should commit itself to attracting foreign funding and expertise and to developing a policy of transparency," he said at the 16th meeting of the group responsible for deepening the overall reform.
Supporting transparency while pushing ahead with reforms to increase new movement and vitality and creating new room for economic growth," Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted a series of guidelines including a negative list of market access restrictions, a relaxation of border control principles, an invitation to state-owned companies to seize private capital and a revision of the resident registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list of sectors and enterprises in which no investment is allowed will be created.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through pilot programmes.
This change is significant as it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensures a legal business environment and makes the market more transparent, the opinion states.
The government also relaxes its control over the power it distributes to companies, thus ensuring that companies decide for themselves how to manage their business.
The opinion also stated that China would allow border regions to explore new cross-border models of economic cooperation and new mechanisms for regional growth.
In order to open up government-controlled sectors to private financiers, more sectors are opened up.
"The government will not change its approach regarding foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services," said the opinion.
In addition, the application process of foreign permanent residence permits, "green cardien," will be facilitated by optimising requirements and streamlining the application process.
The meeting also discussed guaranteeing the rights of lawyers to practise their profession and supporting professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a post-meeting opinion.
