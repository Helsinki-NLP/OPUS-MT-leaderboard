A 28-year-old chef was found dead in a San Francisco mall.
Only recently, a 28-year-old chef who moved to San Francisco was found dead in a local shopping mall stairwell this week.
The victim's brother says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother. "He had finally got his affairs straightened out."
The body found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco Frank Galicia, reported from the San Francisco Medical Department.
According to San Francisco Police Department, death is being investigated as a homicide.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia told the television company ABC's radio station in San Francisco that Frank, a former chef in Boston, had found his dream job six months ago when he became chef at the San Francisco Sons & Daughters Restaurant.
A representative of the Sons & Daughters restaurant said that death was a shock to all of them.
"We're a small, tight team, like a family, and we're gonna miss you big," the congressman says.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia tells us that Frank first lived in the hostels, but he had finally got his affairs straightened out.
"He found an apartment, and he had a girlfriend," said Louis Galicia to the KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
"He was kind and heartfelt.
His way of being together with the family was to cook for all of us," says Louis Galicia.
"He never wanted to get into a fight with anyone.
He was a brother who went with the river.
Despite all the injustices in the world, he was a rough diamond that shone every day," he says.
Anyone who knows anything about this case will be asked to call the San Francisco Police Department's hotline number 415-575-4444.
Locking junior doctors demand new work - fighting measures
The representatives of British junior doctors (mainly specialised doctors in Finland) have appealed to their trade union and asked for permission for new work-fighting measures in the dispute over the new employment contract.
The JDC, a member of the British Medical Association (BMA), is requesting support from its whole government for further work-fighting operations from early September.
According to the JDC, the ministers have not solved the problem of the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with BMA during the vote in July.
58% of the members who took part in the vote rejected the agreement.
On Thursday evening, the chairman of the Junior Medical Committee, Ellen McCourt, published a letter to the members of the JDC on Twitter saying that the government had "obstinately" raised the questions which McCourt said led to the rejection of the agreement.
The letter reads: "In light of this, the JDC Government has voted against the whole new draft treaty and insists that all our concerns be subject to new formal negotiations.
In response to the government's silence, the government of the JDC has today submitted a formal request to the BMA Government requesting permission for gradual expansion of labour martial arts operations since early September'.
Because of the controversy, junior doctors have been on strike six times this year, including the first complete work solstice ever in the history of the British public health system.
Johann Malawana, head of BMA junior doctors, resigned after the vote because he did not accept the negotiated terms of agreement recommended by BMA.
At the meetings leading up to the vote, Mr Malawiana told the BMA members that the agreement was good and should be approved; 54 000 junior doctors and medical students took part in the vote.
After the vote, Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the agreement will enter into force and will apply to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: external alliance?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
On Tuesday, the leaders of Russia and Turkey met to shake hands as a compromise and to bring an official end to the eight-month vocabulary war and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of his palace in Peter, I had the clear impression that Ankara had a greater desire for reconciliation.
The parties did shake hands.
But Putin's smile looked thin and he didn't get much heat even by his own restraining standard.
On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his "good friend" Mr Putin - according to a report five times.
I couldn't keep track of myself.
He also promised that relations with Russia would be even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country wrote that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I personally understood his zeal just the opposite.
But the constant coolness of Putin showed that the head of Russia has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the first thing Mr Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction to the time of the event was fierce.
Putin attacked Ankara with strict words and accused her of stabbing him in the back.
The insult was even greater because it came from a supposed friend.
It will be difficult, perhaps even impossible, to regain real trust.
Public opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media campaigned for a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, however, it seemed that the Turks were responsible for everything.
The most serious were the accusations made by top officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in Isisi-controlled areas in Syria.
Erdogan has strongly denied the accusations.
However, the official message from Peter was that it was time to move forward.
After all, this meeting was only organised to get Putin the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
This may have enabled Russia to win some kind of victory.
The benefits of declaring a ceasefire to a severe one are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost out of power last month in a failed coup.
He has also been clearly shaken by repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey.
There is also an economic motive for reconciliation.
Russia's sanctions have hit Turkey hard, in particular the charter ban, since, normally, several million Russian tourists travel to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has collapsed by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly sigh of relief when air transport can eventually continue.
They're putting their faith in the late season rushing into the Mediterranean Sea.
And yet this week, state television has predicted a fall in the price of fruit and vegetables when Turkish agricultural products are allowed to be imported again.
"Turns there, tomatoes back here," was formulated in Vedemost's article.
But the visit was also of greater political value to Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West, as it feels that the West is silent in its reaction to the attempt to seize power.
Without forgetting the old resentment about Turkey's accession negotiations and Putin's intervention, which is eager to take advantage of the cool relations and break Turkey's ties to the west.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support to the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
This was self-evident to Moscow, which has its own deep concern about the change of power.
Thus, Russia and Turkey were able, at their top meeting in the glorious seafront latrine, to convey a picture that one analyst described as "the coalition of the outsiders': two countries that feel abandoned and mistreated by the West unite their forces.
Despite public reconciliation, these two still have major differences.
The most significant is Syria, where Moscow has created itself as a peacemaker, but Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
There is much to be said about the fact that, after almost three hours of initial negotiations, both presidents told at a press conference that they had not discussed the subject at all.
The Turkish President deliberately refused to answer the question of the differences between the countries, while Putin stressed them.
There is no clear consensus between countries on where they could seek agreement in Syria.
Given the possibility of a total disaster caused by the NATO Member State, Turkey, when shooting down a Russian combat machine, it is undoubtedly better that, after months of open hostility, these two Heads of State are even speaking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland
According to the President of the RBS Bank, the bank's activities outside Scotland will be reduced in such a way that it will only provide business services, i.e. back office services.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally linked to the Bank's global objectives.
The bank had to retreat from its goals when it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued.
During that period, brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsors international sport with millions of pounds, such as Six Nations rugby and Wimbledon Master Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to put more national brands in the forefront.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will remain at the disposal of Scottish customers, but it will not be used as an abbreviation for RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are changed to NatWeste, with the exception of head office and stock exchange listing.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are also smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a presentation to customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He said to BBC Scotland: "RBS will become an investment brand and the one with whom our staff is employed, because we are now becoming much more a bank of different brands.
Since the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our ambitions are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in its own community, and our employees work with customers under these brands."
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations rugby and has raised the profile of different brands in sport sponsorship.
"Now is the time to become a bank with different brands, because basically the question is how we can make the bank better for customers," says the President of the Bank.
"Three years ago it would have been very sarcastic if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and introduced brands.
But the work we have done and the focus on the needs of our customers rather than our own needs have changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back again, so I think the time is right."
Frankie Dettori rode the Prediction to victory in Newmarket and won his 3,000th victory.
Dettori sprays champagne after winning twice in a row in Newmarket, which meant a 3,000th victory for him.
Jockey Frankie Dettori confirmed his 3,000th victory in the British Championship at Newmarket on Friday.
This milestone he reached by riding his horse Predilection twice to victory on the same night on the track of his locality. Predilection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in the races running on a level track.
He's the same as Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time master jockey Dettori, who once won Ghayyar, says: "This is special.
My feelings are on the edge because my family's here too.
I am very glad that this happened in Newmarket because this is where I ended up 30 years ago.
The competition is not a big event, not a Royal Ascot, but a perfectly normal Friday night and a 20,000-person audience.
I'm relieved and I feel great humility."
Dettori welcomes the cheering with Prediction after his victory
Two jockeys have reached a milestone in the obstacle races, and they are master jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won over 4,300 times in his record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 wins.
"Frankie is one of the best jockeys of this age, and it is no surprise that he was the one who reached this milestone that few have reached.
He's elegant and strong, but his tactical prowess is what separates him from the others.
He is a fantastic representative of the race riding, his enthusiasm and qualifiers have brought supporters to the sport for years."
"I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have won 6,000 races if he didn't only compete on weekends and only in big races!
Seriously, Frankie's riding career in the British Games has been victorious for almost 30 years, which has been wonderful to follow.
He is a lively person, which is good for British racing, but above all he is an incredible jockey."
Frankie Dettori fanned his achievement in a symbolic way by flying off his horse.
"From flying goals to flying downhills, Frankie Dettori has been a model for British racing for two decades.
There's room for ups and downs.
He has won numerous big races, including his famous victory at Ascot in 1996 "Magnificent Seven," but he has also survived a plane crash and has been banned because of drug abuse.
Three years ago, when the non-compete ended, he had trouble getting started, but he showed admirable strength of character, looked to his skeptics and returned to his best.
And for a while now, he's not about to end his career - Dettori has recently said he wants to continue racing until he's at least 50 years old."
Putin was dismissed by Sergei Ivanov, Head of Administration
President Vladimir Putin of Russia suddenly dismissed his chief of administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been a part of Putin's trusted inner circle for several years.
Mr Ivanov, 63, was now appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
According to the Kremlin press release, President Putin "decides to relieve Ivanov of his duties as Head of the Russian Presidential Administration," but no grounds for dismissal were given.
Anton Vaino, Deputy Head of Ivanov, was appointed to the post from 2012.
Persecution, 44, former diplomat.
Vaino, born in Tallinn in 1972, graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later he headed the President's Protocol Department and the Government Office, reports the Russian-speaking website of the Kremlin.
Persecution thanked Putin for his appointment in these words: "I am grateful for your confidence.
I believe that the main task of the administration is to support your actions as Head of State, which means making draft laws and monitoring how your instructions are implemented."
Putin told the Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov himself had asked for his resignation and recommended Persecution as his successor.
Are the smiles real?
This move has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov has long been close to Vladimir Putin, and like Putin, he also has a KGB past.
As administrator, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on Russian state television, both said that Ivanov would withdraw from the mission at his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, the explanations only convince a few, especially under the parliamentary elections.
Are fired the result of some kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows that yet.
Russia has been very sceptical about the official claim that a man who has been hailed as President suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy.
The Kremlin website contains the words of Ivanov to Putin, where he says: "It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to give me responsibility for this very complex and to some extent even difficult task for four years.
Now I have served as President's Head of Administration for four years and eight months."
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Before that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB of the State Security Service.
When Putin served as Head of the FSB of the Russian Federation's Security Service replaced by the KGB in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed Deputy Chief of Staff.
When Putin came into power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
At one time it was thought that Ivanov might become President Putin of Russia after the second period, since the Constitution would have prevented Putin from being elected for the third period.
However, the mission went to another member of Putin's circle, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister, after which he returned to office only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds - FBI investigators star Thomas Gibson got fired for hitting a producer
Gibson was involved in a violent fight on the set in Los Angeles last month.
The ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios companies produced the series reported on the firings in their joint release.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, known as Gibson, had made an apology on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
"We had creative differences.
I'm sorry this happened," he says in his press release.
Information on how Gibson's character is written out of the next series of FBI agents will be published later, reports the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Previously in the comedy series, Dharma & Greg, 54-year-old Gibson has been in the series since its first production season, or since 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the last twelve years," says Gibson in a release published on Friday.
"I was hoping to see the show to the end, but it's no longer possible.
I would like to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our great production team and most important: the best fans the show could have wanted."
The 12th season of the series will start in the United States on September 28.
The Mysterious Beaching of Fishes in the Banffilainen Garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help to identify the fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects that these 75 fish are wind fish that have been sucked into the ground by a hurricane.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the seashore, published footage of the vision in Periscope, hoping to receive an answer to the appearance of these five - centimeter fish.
The Queensferry Overpass has now been connected to the Fife.
The £1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern deck and land bridge of the Queensferry Overpass, which means the bridge is now connected to the Fife.
It is the first of four sections between the "covers" that are now almost ready around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10 000 tonnes of steel and 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 crooked wire ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Minister Keith Brown, who was in charge of the house, visited the site today and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
Brown says: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Overpass.
We are all witnessing a really significant step forward in building a bridge, with over 30 000 concrete and steel being used to build this section alone.
Despite its massive size and weight, building the bridge section between the land bridge and the bridge deck is a subtle operation requiring extremely precise installation tolerances.
Almost 79% of the entire bridge deck is now in place, and the rest of the deck is getting its concrete decks in Rosyth today, which means that the deck is ready to be put in place."
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, says: "The completion of the first bridge section is always a significant urine column in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this share represents the peak of the road and civil engineering industry.
After the last part of the road deck was installed and connected to the road cover of the North Tower column, we had to close the remaining gap on the north side (i.e. the continent).
This was done by pulling a northerly land bridge 700 millimeters southward.
This was a massive operation with high accuracy at the same time.
Massive because the land bridge is 222 metres in length and about 6,000 tonnes in weight and had to be pulled up at a slope angle of about 3%.
And demanding great precision, because the tolerances that the work team had to follow were very small - only a few millimeters.
I'm glad everything went well."
The Moelfre Bay Rescue Department tells of the miracle rescue of three men.
Anglesey, three men who had been caught in the water off his fishing boat, were miraculously saved.
The Marine Rescue Station of Moelfre RNLI issued an alert on Friday at 1:20 p.m. local time after its crew detected an accident in the Bay of Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety while their boat continued its reckless course without a director.
"We saw the boat moving right next to them and imagined the worst," says Vince Jones, who drives Moelfre's lifeboat.
"By the time we got out of the water, the strong winds had, fortunately, carried the boat away from them."
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third, aged 60 years old, was found exhausted clinging to a buoy and without a life vest.
They were all picked up in a coastal rescue boat and transported to the rescue station.
Vince Jones says: "It is a miracle that these three men who have been watered are still alive and perfectly fit.
The boat's engine had an emergency extinguishing cord, but for some reason it had been disconnected from the man who was driving the boat during the crash.
They were really lucky to be here."
Pokémon Go hunt brings health and happiness
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
During the last decade, many people have complained about why teenagers and children no longer go out to play but rather stay inside and stare at their screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get off the couch and move.
Originally, the screen time was taken only by watching TV, then the video games came along, and most recently by smartphones.
So it is wonderful to see that technology and outdoor exercise do not exclude one another.
This, of course, refers to the Pokémon Go crazy. Pokémon Go is a game application that comes from a video game created in the 1990s (which later included a series of cartoons, playing cards and other accessories).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, this also came to an end shortly before the new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
The launch in other countries was delayed due to an enormous interest that overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, the number of users of Pokémon Go overtook Tinder and was almost as high as on Twitter.
Then how does the game work?
In short, players go out on their smartphones to find pokémons that are monitored with GPS. When you find pokémon, it can be "photographed" (with a phone screen image) or "captured."
The wildness has caught up with the generation that played the video game when they were younger and lifted the buttocks off the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps taken by the "average person" per day.
The Washington Post recently reported on the Cardiogram app of Apple Watch, which discovered within two days of the launch that the number of people moving 30 minutes a day suddenly rose from 45% to 53%.
The company does not know which user plays Pokémon Go, it only sees the raw data of the amount of exercise.
Many public health campaigns that encourage people to get off the couch and move for at least 30 minutes a day have fallen on deaf ears because they have been dull and their advertisers have looked unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Regularly moving people are less likely to develop cancer or depression.
Exercise helps with weight control, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a great deal of other benefits.
The beauty of Pokémon Go is that it makes people out to do something they enjoy.
It thus achieves three basic health - physical activity, fresh air, and sun and joy.
It is even possible to make new friends during the hunt.
As usual, this phenomenon includes disapproving ruiners of joy.
And yes, someone can walk towards the door while playing.
What about it?
Breakthrough is complete.
For although smartphone applications such as Fitbit may have previously been able to monitor your activity, they did not give us any reason to move, as Pokémon Go does.
The ecstasy of newness disappears, and in time the use is reduced.
However, thanks to the success of the Pokémons, there will be more games where applications and virtual reality are combined with activity in the real world, which will increase the physical activity and improve their fitness and health.

Simone Biles grabbed gold in a women's rack gymnastics multiplayer match.
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all these things.
Dynamic jumps.
It's troubleless at the booms.
The jaws are dissipating on the perm.
Excellent at everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
On Thursday, an American 19-year-old rack gymnasian won a multiplayer championship and increased the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic spotlight.
His total score of 62.198 was clearly better than that of the silver teammate "Final Five" Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States will perform at the finals of the multiplayer competition for women's rack gymnastics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the Summer Olympics in Rio 2016.
The party became the fourth in a row and the fifth American woman of all time who won the multiplayer championship, thus confirming her reputation as the best of her generation, or even the best of all time.
Biles burst into tears when his final point came to light and his long way to this moment ended.
Achievement takes the species into completely new dimensions and puts him in the same category as other superstars in sport, such as Michael Phelps:
He has won 15 World Championship Medals, of which 10 gold, and earned them with so ambitious and precise programs that the 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton called him "the greatest set gymnast of all time."
In Brazil there was still one last contest between Bilesh and himself and the burden of overly high expectations, not so much between Bales and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Texas Spring is less than a handful of gold medals would be a disappointment.

Billes won the first gold medal on Tuesday as a point on top of I for Martha Karolly's farewell party, who was coordinating the national team and now retiring.
Although Biles claimed that he had never thought of anything in advance when he was at the top for a long time, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program - which includes a series of volts known as his trump card - is adapted to Latin music, which might well be heard on the streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's no coincidence.
When his grandparents were little enough to adopt, and Coach Aimee Boorman's mother's discovery has become a force figure. Boorman found her when she was on a day-care trip to the gymnasium where Boorman was training.
He hasn't lost a single multi-game contest since summer 2013, and the winning streak is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina managed to take a small lead with two threads, it was like a mirage.
It was left with a boom and a permanent, where Biles is a defending champion of the world.
He regained leadership after reaching 15,433 points from the boom and crowned the outcome with a 15,933 points from the perm.
Raisman kindly hugged him as they waited for the final points - a mere formality - and tears began to appear around the red, white, and blue boundary color of Bales when his dream, once written in his scrapbook, came true.
Raisman's performance was a small rematch to four years ago when he first divided the third place but then lost the bronze to Mustafina in the re-round.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader the Americans call "grandma" was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent air kisses to the audience after his permanto program and thus became a winner, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
As far as Bales is concerned, this 19-year-old's earlier week's widespread tweeting has a whole new meaning:
Police report that three people listening to music in a car have been victimized by a serial killer.
Two women and a 12-year-old girl were killed in the most devastating massacre in Phoenix in ten years. The victims sat in the car talking and listened to music when they were shot, reports a police report published on Thursday.
According to the authorities, on 12 June, Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis, and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the side of the street.
The shooter stood on the passenger side of the car, from which he fired eight shots with a handgun and then escaped with another car, says the press release.
The police suspect that the triple murder wasn't caused by the robbery because the attacker didn't take the purses or the $2,900 found in the possession of another adult victim.
Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, says that the police are now investigating whether or not the murder is related to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have died and two have been wounded in nine attacks, mostly in areas inhabited by Latin Americans within four months.
"It is common for events to happen that they have occurred in residential areas outside homes," Howard told KPO, a subsidiary of the television and radio company CBS earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including the brown Nissan at the end of the 1990s, the black BMW at the end of the 1990s and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Researchers do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are connected and that the person who did them is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital for injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died instantly at the scene.
The eyewitness told the police that the three had often sat in the car listening to music.
In addition, the police issued a press release describing the shooting of an empty pickup truck just half an hour before the triple kill, which is believed to be the same in both cases.
Scientists found shell casings and recovered a bullet from the car seat and a bullet from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old boy with microcephaly: "Things are getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most other peers, Edmund has microcephaly, or congenital small - headedness, due to the genetic disorder of his mother Elizabeth Picciuto, whom he was unaware of when she was pregnant.
"When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was that I wouldn't get away with this.
I'm not gonna make it.
I didn't commit to this.
Which is not at all true - of course you are committed to it," he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them or survive at all.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest that the child be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that I didn't think there was any such practice at all," says Picciuto.
Edmund walks with a roller.
Edmund sat up and didn't start crawling until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's moving slowly at his own pace.
He walks with assistance and rides a bicycle.
She likes to play with her two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth is showing me the sign that Edmund invented, which means "sing to me."
"We'll teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News news.
However, it does not just mean the usual sign language; it also includes signs made up by Edmund himself.
Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of diseases: hereditary diseases, such as Edmund's, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or zikavirus.
Symptoms and predictions vary greatly.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the lives of people who have Zikavirus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional storm caused by an uncertain future.
"I keep saying, "What's gonna happen to us,
What's gonna happen to us?"
And he still doesn't know.
"I haven't asked for a prognosis in a long time, because I don't think anyone can give it."
But Picciuto has hopeful counsel for mothers whose children have birth defects caused by the zika virus.
"Things are getting better.
Things tend to work out.
You love your child, and your child loves you."
Heavy rains and floods caused major rescue operations in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi
On Friday, the governor of Louisiana declared a state of emergency due to heavy rains and widespread floods, and more rain in the state is expected on Saturday.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers in South-East Louisiana and South Mississippi flooded over their banks and spread to a large area as a result of heavy rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards reports that state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and help is already on the way to flood areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the National Security and Emergency Response Office, reports that the Agency receives requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags.
According to Steele, the Tangipoho County alone has requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood warning will remain in force until Saturday in most of South Louisiana.
According to the Weather Service report, there may be an additional 76-127 mm of water entering the area.
A flood warning was issued in southern Alabama on Friday as the rains continued in the region of Mobile.
During the weekend, near the Comite River Baton Rouge and the Amite River Denham Springs, both of them in Louisiana, are predicted to rise to record heights.
According to weatherman Alek Krautmann, many houses along the rivers may be flooded in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
He also says that floods downriver in Ascension County constitute a threat, as the flooding rivers slowly drain into Lake Maurepas.
In Liverpool, Louisiana, the Tickfaw River, just south of the state border of Mississippi, was higher than ever on Friday at 9:00.
The rescue work continued in the counties of Amite and Wilkinson in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were earlier on Friday near Gloster among the rescued.
Hansford, 62, reports that the Beaver Creek River, normally more than 120 metres from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
She had been warned by another stepson who lived nearby.
"We got up, and water came with a constant pitch," says Hansford.
"It reached my waist."
She had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high in the 48 years she has lived in the area.
Hansford tells us that he and his family all have injuries, and he himself is the only swim expert.
The rescue workers had rescued all three of them into a large army - style truck and had taken them to the fire station in Gloster, where they held shelter on Friday.
The weatherman Krautmann says that floods are spreading rapidly as heavy rains continue, and the authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He tells of information received from an observer near Livingston that almost 350 mm had rained between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says the soil was heavily wet after the rains began on Wednesday.
Authorities report that due to the flooding of heavy rains and streets, the county residents of Tangipahoa had to be rescued from their homes and school hours had to be cancelled in five school districts.
A member of the City Council of Tangipaho had told a subsidiary of the television and radio company CBS WWL that there were 200 homes under the flood.
The inhabitants had been evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has reached both.
County director Robby Miller reports that the authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets who had been caught in the flood.
Evacuated people have been opened shelters in the cities of Amite and Hammond.
"They get to go back to their homes when the water starts to withdraw," he says.
Nearly twenty streets of the district of Hammond, Tangipaho, were closed due to the flood, and the inhabitants were offered sandbags to try to prevent water from entering their homes and businesses.
"The last time we had a great flood in March," says Lacy Landrum, member of the City Council.
"This flood seems similar."
In Mississippi, the rains continued steadily along the Gulf of Mexico, says Rupert Lacy, the Harrison County Rescue Director.
Lacy reports that a handful of houses were reported on Thursday, but so far no information had been received on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods, says he has lived in the Amite area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before, and it's raining all the time."
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown, who has had multiple bullets in his body, survives the Philadelphia shooting.
According to the police, a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, who is already another 6-year-old shot in the city this week.
The child's grandparents told me on CBS Philadelphia channel that the boy was Mahaj Brown.
According to grandparents, the boy had several gunshot wounds in his groin, leg, arm, and abdomen, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got many hits, his little body was full of bullets," said his grandmother Delores Melendez to the television company.
"I can't believe this is happening."
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the television company that they think he's gonna make it.
He was about to start first grade at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people who was shot in the Germantown district.
Two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man were also targeted.
Another 29 year old condition was reported to be critical and the other two were stable, according to CBS Philadelphia.
According to the television company, the child was found in the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition.
The other two victims weren't in the car, and the police are now investigating whether one of the wounded men could have been the shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a crossfire between many armed men.
The scene was filled with shell casings of the type of assault weapon that originated from various types of assault weapons.
"It is quite clear that this was an ongoing battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
Several armed fighters have been present and have been actively involved in the shooting," said Philadelphia Police Chief Inspector Anthony Ginaldi to the television station.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
There haven't been any arrests, and they say the police are going through surveillance videos.
Another shooting victim in the city this week was a 6-year-old girl with a stray bullet in her hand while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane district on Tuesday.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
This is what I call the Olympic team for women's rack gymnastics, and there is more than one reason.
First of all, I have been in every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the United States has never been as superior as it is now.
Secondly, the three gymnasts of this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colored girls.
The team's composition, complemented by the Jewish Aly Raisma and Catholic Madison Kocia, makes everyone proud.
The team is finally representing America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of women of black and Latin background at the top of the species.
For the past four years, the best female rack gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were in position one and two.
This is awesome.
At the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas became the surprise winner of the Games, and the whole of America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances and surprising and masterly rack gymnastics programs of the three world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez.
On Thursday Simone became the fourth American in a row to win gold in a female individual match.
Teammate Aly Raisman, on the other hand, won silver.
Views are like this at the top of the species, but it doesn't look like the same for rack gymnastics all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same trail as Aly and Madison to form an Olympic team.
They are the last five (the Final Five), for the next Olympic team of rack gymnastics will have only four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as a coach.
The reality is, however, that rack gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnastics practice mainly in private rack gymnastics clubs maintained by their parents. Parents pay for training costs, facilities, trips, costumes, competition fees, hotel fees (coachers, gymnastics and family members) etc.
Most rack gymnastics clubs are located in prosperous residential areas that are able to support their activities.
Teaching rack gymnastics takes place in these clubs, and that means a costly and long-term commitment for gymnastics families.
Simone Biles' coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez' coach Maggie Haney have both coached sports enthusiasts since they started rack gymnastics.
We need to provide more affordable and accessible rack gymnastics lessons for countless young girls whose enthusiasm has been aroused by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started my own rack gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
My organisations in Harlem have offered free or affordable access to rack gymnastics for more than 15 000 young people in the city (mostly blacks and Latin Americans), some of whom have reached national and international championships.
In September we will expand our activities to my hometown, Detroit, so that we can offer high-quality rack gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings lifelong benefits and supports good health and success in school and working life.
This team has aroused enthusiasm in thousands of young girls who now want to start rack gymnastics, and that is absolutely awesome.
Participation in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the real "girl power" you showed in winning the Olympic gold and for motivating so many young girls of different backgrounds to start their way into well-being, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal and are preparing for new strikes
Ministers hoped to decide on changes to pay and working conditions by adopting a renewed agreement with the British Medical Association (BMA), but 58% of the 37 000 so-called junior doctors who took part in the vote rejected the proposal.
In July, Minister Hunt told us of plans to reach an agreement by force and said that the British public health system (NHS) was "no one's country" and that any further delay would be detrimental to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will move to a new agreement which will include changes in night and weekend working practices to improve health care in antisocial times.
The chairman of the BMA Junior Medical Committee, Ellen McCourt, issued a statement last night saying: "Junior doctors are still very reserved for the proposed agreement, with particular fear that it will accelerate the current labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
There are only eight weeks until the first doctors are transferred to the new contract, so we need to move forward now, because time is running out.
The BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by talking, but the government has been reluctant and sometimes even without reacting in any way.
Even though Jeremy Hunt made a promise last month that his door would always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, abolish the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this does not happen, junior doctors will be ready for further work action."
The previous strike at the end of April delayed almost 13 000 routine procedures and 100 000 reception times when nurses and consulting doctors were asked to support strike guards.
Ministers hoped to conclude the dispute over the changes by concluding a renewed agreement with British doctors' trade union staff.
Trade union BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54,000 junior doctors who would be covered by the agreement.
Daniel Mortimer, director-general of NHS employees, appealed to junior doctors not to strike again.
Mortimer says: "Professional measures achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already operating at the extremes and cause anxiety, distress and disturbance for patients, medical staff and their families.
For the last two months, we have been negotiating with the Junior Medical Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have welcomed their concerns regarding the role of the supervisor and the detection of irregularities.
The workers were hopeful that continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as development, flexibility in education, further training for returnees from career breaks, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, student leave and gender pay gap in the care sector - were a sign of how seriously workers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health want to stick to the agreements concluded with BMA in November, February and May'.
A medicine that pays about €2.40 a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients with heart attacks are receiving a daily dose of about €2.40 when the authorities recommended that it be given to more people and longer-term use.
The anti-clotting agent ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The medicine is already given 12 months after the heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a new heart attack.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), which is part of the British public health system (NHS), has advised that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years in order to increase the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) within the British public health system (NHS) and which evaluates the introduction of new therapies has advised that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years in order to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems even further.
In England, about 140,000 people have a heart attack each year, one quarter of which is re-occurring or having a stroke.
The cause of heart attacks and strokes is fatty material that accumulates in the walls of blood vessels, causing plaques.
If the plaque ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that prevents the blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if a blood clot is released, it can pass through the bloodstream and prevent blood flow to the brain, resulting in stroke.
The risk of a new seizure is higher in people who have had a heart attack once.
The ticagrelor produced by British AstraZeneca, sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of plugs.
The draft NICE guidelines published today recommend that ticagrelor be given next 90 mg for 12 months and then reduced to 60 mg and aspirin twice daily for another three years.
Carole Longson, Professor of the Centre for the Evaluation of Treatment Methods, says: "Although effective treatments are available to prevent disease progression and symptoms effectively, up to a quarter of those who have a heart attack suffer a new seizure or stroke - often with fatal consequences.
Fear of renewal can have a very negative effect on human quality of life.
We have seen evidence that ticagrelor combined with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation for temporary use of ticagrelor increases treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it."
Due to limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially as regards the risk of bleeding, if used for more than three years, the draft guideline does not recommend the use of a treatment method for longer periods.
Due to the climate of political correctness, electoral fraud in Muslim regions flourished
The former Mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was dismissed from his post last year due to corruption, resulting in a government report
The climate of political correctness led to the closure of the eyes of widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, reveals a government report published today.
The former government minister Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticised the police, election observers and city councils for blinding themselves to electoral fraud 'because of the hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion'.
According to Pickles, a former Minister of Regional Government and now known as the anti-corruption force, the intimidation of the electorate for religious reasons was so bad that the police should have had permission to set up security chains outside the polling stations to protect the frightened voters.
He suggests that voters should present identity cards in order to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At the moment, the electorate must only state its name and address.
In addition, the report proposes to baptize fingers after voting on the indeterminate ink so that no one can vote twice.
The whistle-blowers should be protected more, says Sir Eric.
He called for better access for journalists to government documents and decisions by informal committees and working parties.
"The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to combat corruption and fraud against financial interests and a culture that favours them more widely in local administrations," he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report after the vote scandal in East London Tower Hamlet.
Last year, a special electoral court ordered that the then mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should resign because of corruption and numerous unlawful practices.
The Court held that Rahman "wrongly" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and anti-Islamicism.
Rachman was said to be "the basis of his campaign for the religious obligation of every religious Muslim to vote for him."
Up to 300 of the votes were questionable or given fraudulently by a person's putting himself to the vote by pretending to be another person.
According to Sir Eric, there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern at the postal fraud in which members of the Muslim community were reported to have pressured people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric (in the picture) made a number of proposals to clean up the voting system, including requiring an identity card at the polling station.
The report says: "There is evidence that some vulnerable members of ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the wishes of older members, particularly in communities with Pakistan and Bangladesh'.
"We were concerned that... state institutions had closed their eyes to such activities because of a "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals to clean up the system, including a ban on the handling of post ballot tickets by political activists, in order to prevent 'sound harvesting'.
The report under consideration by Theresa May also calls for more stringent checks to be carried out in connection with the registration in order to prevent the use of the register of voting rights for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consideration of alternatives requiring voters to present identity documents before voting.
Baptizing fingers after voting in the infinite ink so that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure the nationality and voting rights of voters.
Setting a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibition of the processing of stuffed voice and voice mail envelopes by post from political activists.
Police have the right to set up security chains around polling stations.
Amendment of the law to make it easier to prosecute intimidation charges under the Act of Accession of the People Act of 1983 on the extension of voting rights.
Denial of photography at polling stations.
Only to allow English at polling stations (except Wales).
Step up training to ensure that staff are supervised by the rule that only one person may enter the voting booth at a time.
Sir Eric strongly criticises the London police and considers it "awesome" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlet incident.
"The election court dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his representative from his post for corruption and numerous unlawful practices," he says.
"He was found guilty without serious doubt and the criminal evidence threshold was exceeded on many grounds."
He also criticised the ineffective "travel checks" of the city council's electoral lists.
"The decision of the Court of Justice last year in the case of Tower Hamlet was a wake-up call," says Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of its legacy as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by the worrying and disguised electoral fraud committed by some parties and the denial of it."
The resemblance of an Olympic biker with Duchess Catherine and other doppelgangers at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics went wild from the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge is amazing.
But according to social media discussions, this 24-year-old Olympic representative is by no means the only athlete fighting for a championship with a resemblance to a well-known person.
In honor of the Rio Games and all the well-known faces on our screens, FEMAI compiled a list of all Olympic representatives whose resemblance to Hollywood celebrities is obvious.
The hunter and the wolf: Brady Ellison (left) of the U.S. men's archery team has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to Duchess Catherine's doppelganger seen on the bike tracks, many people have quoted in social media how one of the archers could be the actress' favorite twin brother of Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison of the U.S. men's archery team caused a storm on Twitter after pictures of her in which she was startlingly like the star of Wolf of Wall Street.
Ellison was aware of the social media noise and admitted that she had heard since she was a child that she was like DiCaprio.
"I don't see the resemblance so large, perhaps except for the beard and mustache," Brady Huffington said to the Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take this as a compliment."
In the 2012 London Games, British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris were shuddered at the resemblance, which is undoubtedly brought up even more in these races.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with great and expressive eyes, has been called the doppelganger of Gloria Estefan, a Cuban-American singer.
The South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Matthew Morrison, known from the Glee TV series for years.
This user says Nathan Adrian is a "athletic version" of the actor of Inception.
Similarly, the resemblance between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett has long been quoted, highlighted by both strong eyebrows and lips.
I swim silver medalist, Russian Yulia Efimova resembles actress Annalynne McCord, not only because of her beautifully tan skin and blond hair, but Nathan Adrian of the United States team is a "athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt" according to his fans.
These two iron women, soccer star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter's actor Jennifer Carpenter (right), resemble each other in face and eyes.
Not only was this Twitter user delighted when others also saw the resemblance.
This user wonders if the couple's resemblance is a good reason.
One tweeter recently expressed his joy when "other people on the Internet agree with the resemblance between Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter."
The American soccer star and the Dexter actor really are startlingly similar to each other in face and eyes.
Many have also observed the resemblance of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and the actress Laura Linney in the smiles and the gold-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas and Anna in the wide smiles of Gabrielle Union.
The CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying "dead like a pig" to a Chinese swimmer.
Byron MacDonalds' analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan in a women's 4 x 200 meter free-bathing message shocked the viewers of the CBC's direct Olympic report on Wednesday.
The Canadian broadcaster CBC has had to apologize since one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "lost stinks" and "dead like a pig" during the race.
Explainer Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he started shooting his own opinions at the end of the women's 4 x 200 meter free-bath finale.
MacDonald, who was included in the CBC reporting team to bring color, was heard to say, "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, he left fast, and he died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swim the second part of the message at 1:57.79 and remained 1.61 seconds from Taylor Ruck, Canada, which allowed the Canadians to swim to China.
Viewers from all over Canada react quickly after shocking at the tone and language of the commentator.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig??
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air."
The Chinese Ai Yanhan, who slept in the finals of the women's 4 x 200 meter free-bathing message, was described as: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter was quickly filled with fierce comments by Byron MacDonald, and many demanded his dismissal.
Tweeters didn't hold back their words when they heard how reckless Byron Macdonald was.
Tweeter Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like racist people.
Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, quickly regretted MacDonald's speeches: "We apologize for the comment made on the swim performance.
It was an unfortunate choice of words and we regret that this has happened."
The CBC finally had to apologise more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Mr Scott Russell, a Com missioner, had to apologise on behalf of Mr MacDonald.
The CBC then copied and glued its apologies to more than 90 other tweets commenters complaining about MacDonald's speeches.
The TV company also quickly made a public apology.
"We sincerely regret these statements and the fact that they were broadcast.
On last night's broadcast, we quickly apologized to our viewers, and we also apologized to our social media followers.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments had to do with the swimmer's performance, not with him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was unfortunate, and Byron is very sorry for what he said."
On Thursday evening, MacDonald apologized on the air and tried to justify his speeches by saying that he did not mean it to be personal.
"I want to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's swim," MacDonald said in the CBC Olympic broadcast.
"I referred to the performance of the swimmer, not the person.
It goes without saying that I did not mean anything demeaning in my words, and I am very sorry."
In Primark, unhindered underwear in the middle of the store, the woman who made up the deal shocked the customers
Customers didn't know where to look when a woman undressed in the middle of Primark to try on her underwear.
He further made the situation worse by assessing what he looked like in his underwear, taking them off and putting them back on the shelf.
He continued to tour and finally tried four pair of panties in a store in Folkestone, Bouverie Place shopping centre.
Folkestone's Primark chain shop in Bouverie Place shopping center, where the woman tried underwear in front of everyone and put them back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children in the store at the same time, says that after experimenting with lingerie, an unknown woman dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He tells of what happened: "People could not believe their eyes.
She stood in the middle of the store, took off her underwear, took off her own tights and panties and put them on.
Instead of trying to do it discreetly, he did it without shame.
Everyone stared at him when he took off the underwear he tried and apparently didn't like it because he put them back on the shelf.
He did it three more times before finally deciding he didn't like them, dressed up and walked out.
He didn't seem to care about the looks... nor did he think about the person who would eventually buy the underwear that he had come to."
Davidson, 33 years old living in Kenttown, continues: "How disgusting to think that someone is taking home underwear that someone else has worn and hasn't washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
"I understand that the store staff tried to remove these items of clothing from the sale after the woman had left - which is right.
It would be terrible to take the new underwear home and find that someone else has tried them without having washed them afterwards," adds Davidson.
Primark's spokesman commented by saying: "Primark is aware of the situation in Folkestone's movement on Tuesday 9 August.
All the products in question have been withdrawn from sale'.
This is how you defend yourself against armed assault with Krav Maga.
The world is full of dangers, but this video from Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed Grand Master Rhon Mizrach of the Krav Maga Association in New York and asked for advice on how to cope with a gun at close range with a waving robber or assaulter.
The video shows how you can defend yourself against the attacker depending on whether the attacker approaches you from the front or the rear.
If the attacker approaches from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around to see the attacker and get off the firing line," says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun so that it sticks between your elbows and your upper arms, and strike the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Then kick the assailant with a knee into the groin, and when he goes out of pain twice as often, slap him in the face with a gun barrel and back off by holding the gun pointed at him.
The technique is equivalent if an armed attacker approaches from the front. You need to move away from the firing line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker cannot trigger.
At the same time, place your weight on the gun and hit the attacker with a fist in the chest. Turn the gun away from the attacker's grip, back away and keep the gun focused on the attacker.
Does that sound awkward?
Check the video and see how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way to get rid of the robber is to hand over your cash unless you're a Krav Maga master.
Traveling world traveler Ian Wright is licking the filthiest places in Europe
The British world traveler put his resistance and cacao reflex to the test by licking the filthiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The Suffolk host and travel guide writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove his resistance by licking euro banknotes, handrails in Piccadilly Circus, a train toilet flush button and a Russian public telephone.
Before licking, Wright measured the objects on a luminometer to see for himself and show the viewers where he was pushing his tongue.
The experiment was made into a documentary film by Ian Wright on the trail of internal power, and its results surprised me.
The idea of licking the flush button of the train toilet can be disgusting, but in fact more bacteria are found in the kitchen sink.
On his way to different parts of Europe, Wright is interviewing doctors and other medical professionals for strengthening good bacteria in the intestines and for their health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked caused anything but a bad - tasted mouth.
Ian Wright originally became known for his travel program, where he tested the endurance of his bowels by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
No doubt the licking of railway stations' handrails and toilet flush button challenged Wright's resistance.
Wright says in the documentary: "I've been pretty carefree about my health since I was a child and I've put things in my mouth, such as dirt, worms and mud water."
In the movie he really showed himself to be equal to his reputation.
Only in a filthy public bathroom in Russia met the border.
The luminometer measured more than 4000 units from the sample.
By comparison, the number of newly washed hands is usually less than 60.
The border came up against the Russian public toilet where Wright refused to lick when the luminometer measured 4,000 units - in newly washed hands the same number is less than 60.
Wright adventures together with Valio in a documentary film produced by Ian Wright - Inner Power, where the number of bacteria is made visible in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the documentary: "This is almost the worst smell I've ever smelled in any bathroom.
There's nothing more dirty than that!
This place is so disgusting, I really don't lick anything here."
Wright produced the documentary film Ian Wright - On the trail of internal power in cooperation with Valio.
The Champion gave Wright the Valio Gefilus containing lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which helps to strengthen good intestinal bacterial strain and resistance.
Vuorenmaa, category manager for snacks, juice and new products, says: "We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time tells about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time brainstorming something crazy, and eventually we ended up with the idea of asking Ia to join us."
Intestinal health has become a global trend.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to bring them into a wider context and tell our daily environment about good and bad bacteria, the importance of intestinal health and how it is related to resistance.
Intestinal health has become a global trend, and the document allows us to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
The film also tells about our sense of humor!"
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: "Let's say I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked certain items we asked for, such as the disgusting Russian bathroom that is also shown in the movie.
Of course, licking some targets was easier for Ian, while some were quite bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty licks on tape."
In Valio's 2015 survey, 84% of respondents specifically associated lactic acid bacteria with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, while 58% reported that they had used at least occasionally products to which lactic acid bacteria were added.
Before his eviction, a family of troublemakers destroyed a city-owned rental house in Saltash, Cornwall.
A family of troublemakers left behind £50,000 in damage to a city-owned rental house after they had been evicted because of the neighborhood terrorization.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband, Shaun Trebilcock, have been evicted from her apartment in Saltash, Cornwall, after numerous complaints against the couple.
After the couple had been forced out of the apartment, the representatives of the rental housing company reported that the dwelling was in refurbished condition.
There were gaping holes in the walls, floorboards were ripped off, garbage was spread on floors and walls were smashed with graffiti.
The couple have now moved, and they are believed to be living in a private apartment.
Donna McEvoy, head of Cornwall Housing, says that she is afraid that the apartment may no longer be saved.
He says: "This has been a nightmare for people living here, no one should have to put up with this.
There is much to consider, since the property is likely to become known as a less pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious, as is its name."
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment from time to time. According to the police, the family's tyranny included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of neighbors, drug abuse and caring, and loud shouting, quarreling and swearing.
In June, Skeldon, 47 years old, signed the lease, received an antisocial behavior order.
Several rooms in the house under threat of demolition found old garbage.
In the past, drugs had been sold and floorboards had been ripped off.
According to the neighbors, the family fought on the street and the police had to call regularly.
Cornwall's housing agency forced the couple to leave this week after giving them 11 weeks to move away voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors were grateful for the eviction - they said their life was an earthly hell.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We've been living next door to them for 20 years, and that whole time has been difficult.
The police have been here incredibly many times."
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we're not used to it!
It's gonna be wonderful now that they've finally been evicted."
Adam Fitzpatrick, the head of the Cornwall Housing Agency, reports that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which the police were regularly called.
Garbage and old toys had been thrown on the wild wall of the rented house.
Fitzpatrick adds: "It is a pity that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his or her family's behavior, as eviction is always the last measure the Cornwall Housing Agency is considering.
This case was very difficult, for the extreme behavior and their actions must have been shocking for the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my working group, the police of Devon and Cornwall and the members of the community who participated in the work and bravely offered to provide us with information.
I hope that this progress will improve the well-being of our neighbours and will send out a message that anti-social behaviour will not be accepted."
Fitzpatrick tells us that the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but were already in their twenties.
A dirty mattress found in one of the house's bedrooms after the eviction
Housing workers now need to clean up the garbage heaps around the house.
The police raided the apartment in 2014 and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, plus scales and other supplies as well as 1 700 pounds of cash.
Skeldon was fined for having been found guilty of possession of a class B drug with the intention of selling it.
He claimed that the money was for his son Lee Skeldon's tombstone, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, Skeldon and her husband have been heard to have moved to a private apartment in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were smeared with graffiti.
The police say they're asking for evictions for tenants who violate the lease rules.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall police say this eviction is a clear warning to tenants who constantly defy the rules.
"This is a clear message to those who think they can behave as they like without charges, as well as to those who suffer from such behavior," says Crow.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never accept criminal and antisocial behavior and will continue to cooperate with their partners to protect our communities.
Low-flying, beach-sweeping army jet scared tourists in Portugal
Sun worshipers experienced the shock of their lives in Aveiro, Portugal.
The Portuguese Air Force's P-3C Orion crashed to a staggering low level.
According to the Air Force, this was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
The picture shows the moment when tourists panicked when a low - flying jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic images show how an army airplane comes almost to the touch of the beach sunbathing tourists in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Understandably, the holidaymakers rose to their feet when they were concerned about the thundering of jet engines that began to be heard before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the photographers of a dramatic passing flight and the videos of social media holidaymakers was Daniel Fernandes, who says: "It passed the beach twice really low, and it was a moment when it looked like it was going down."
Nuno Arroja adds: "I was surfing and I was sure the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were shocked when the plane suddenly appeared and flew amazingly low.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight designed to identify coastal fishing vessels and therefore had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly a little lower than normal because the smoke caused by nearby forest fires had a negative effect on visibility, but according to the Air Force this did not threaten anyone's safety.
Forest fires have caused devastation in parts of mainland Portugal and killed four people on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that due to the low visibility of heavy fog and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessels.
The result of the first half of the year was better than expected
The Social and Health District of South Karelia (Eksote) scored EUR 3.4 million better than planned in January - June.
Eksote's profit was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has helped to dismantle institutional care.
The care guarantee was implemented in all activities.
This year, Eksote is trying to shorten the queues of measures.
Exote covers a deficit previously created with a surplus.
The excess may be used to shorten queues and buy measures for patients.
The result for the whole year is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Eksoten Board will discuss the six-monthly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special border guards swore a military oath in Immola
Seventy officers of the Border and Coast Guard School took a military oath on Friday.
The military oath was held in Immola on Friday.
The whale ceremony of the tenth special frontierist class was held on the garrison sports field.
The military vows were sworn by 70 armored men.
Special border hockey is trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied to become a special border guard.
250 of them were invited to the selection exams.
Special border guards have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans from the border forces during the war attended a veteran meeting during the ceremony.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans attending the event were born in 1918.
Pieselvuo ahead of bandits - criminal intelligence helps solve crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 Finnish police departments has been operated by the RTA, or criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The unit's activity is invisible from the outside.
At Häme Police Department, the unit consists of a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's being pulled by a Sergeant stationed in the Bay.
Lieutenant Lahti is the Chief Executive Officer.
In addition, the unit's strength includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in a civilian uniform.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity," says Deputy Commissioner Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides the rest of the police with various reports.
In Häme, it has acquired information about asylum seekers, among other things.
The latest reform of working methods
The establishment of analytical units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, that is to prevent the police from leaving the marshes until the alarm is alerted.
Using the data collected and analysed by the unit, daily police activities are targeted where they are most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, a criminal intelligence centre was set up in the country, less than three national units and their own criminal intelligence unit for each police department.
In Vantaa, the PTR centre operating in connection with the Central Criminal Police is running operations nationally.
PTR units work with police, customs and Border Guard personnel, as their name suggests.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas divided by police departments and have the task of providing information both to local police forces and to national services.
Intelligence extends beyond your own territory
While an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, it is up to RTA to know what is happening throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the borders of your institution, because so does crime.
People working in RTA have better computer skills than basic police.
Using registers, an alert function database and observations, the unit aims to draw police attention to new phenomena, productive criminal or similar crimes.
This is called serialisation and is one of the most important tools of criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, be it honest or criminal.
By the way it's done, it makes up a certain image.
It can be done either by the method or by the person depending on which police have more information.
Criminals Learn From their Mistakes
Workers in RTA do not walk the city with their collars up, but their work is not entirely public either.
The methods used by both criminals and criminals are not reported because they could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus trying to prevent police efforts to combat crime.
The police will publicly inform you if they anticipate a threat.
For example, such an incident was reported early in the summer, the method used in housebreaking to mark vacant dwellings.
In it, the authors put a stick, pin or a piece of tape on the front door of the apartment to see if the residents were really out of town.
The pre-trial material shall be made public at least to the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
For example, the smartest ones order the District Court minutes, which may indicate that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
Next time, we'll go to the thieves with gloves on.
An interview has been conducted with Deputy Commissioner Tero Seppä from Häme Police Department, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police Department, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärvi from Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police Department.
The police collect and analyse information to plan practical action.
Against this background, the reduction in labour and financing volumes.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was the three-stage PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects data from outside the borders of your institution and Finland.
A schoolgirl from London joined the fatherhood was killed in Syria
News reports that one of the three British students who joined ISIS last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
Lawyer Tasname Akunjee tells us the girl's family heard Sultana died in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in a Russian air strike against Raqqa, an Isis base in Syria, told ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and according to her family she was planning to flee from a war-torn country and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that this will serve as a warning example and a will so that people will understand that this is a real risk when going into the war zone - and that will cause people to give up their decision to leave," says Akunje.
In February 2015, Sultana, along with two other East London schoolgirls, boarded a plane to Turkey and continued on a bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married the Isis fighter in Syria and was widowed only a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court if he is elected.
The Senate's democratic leader, Harry Reid, says he is convinced that the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, will appoint Merrick Garland as Supreme Court judge if he is elected president.
The Republican representatives of the Senate have refused to confirm Garland's appointment since Barack Obama appointed him in March.
According to the Senate's majority leader Mitch McConnell, the next president elects the person to fill the seat of the late Supreme Court judge Anton Scalia.
At the phone conference on Thursday, Reid said that he was predicting Clinton's "pretty sure" choice of Garland.
Reid's publicist later stated that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly to Clinton as to whether he was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to rock the boat by choosing someone else.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Reid says that the Republicans who are blocking Garland's name are the "touchers" and "tossers" of the presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He says Trump doesn't fit in.
According to Treats magazine, nude calendars belong as well to women as to men.
The treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere and launches a 1970s-style calendar inspired by Pirelli for 2017.
Instead of celebrity catalog models, they want to find the next generation of top models in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Steve Shaw, CEO of the Treats, told me earlier this year that his nudity-drinking magazine is different from the old school Playboy magazines because he said: "Playboy is for men.
I'm gonna do this for the ladies."
Apparently, he thinks the same thing about the calendar.
"We need to bring back timeless and classic nudity, where women, as men, can unwittingly enjoy and be inspired by these pictures of the female body," says Shaw in a press release on the calendar.
"I'm sure women want to participate in this project because it's going to be a beautiful work of art."
Those who wish to use the calendar can send their photos online or participate in open selections in Los Angeles and New York City.
Vinyl charm: Who buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you can write to the comment section with the name of your angry protest NoväAllLonelyMen, this claim is based on real research data.
According to the YouGov research company, behind the much-spoken new coming of vinyl plates is not a millennial-generation boom when millennials want to feel a physical object in their hands, but instead there is middle-age nostalgia behind them.
Recently, the age of the person who bought vinyl albumin is most likely between 45 and 54.
In fact, those in age group 18-24 are the least likely buyers.
Also, it is not just a hobby's desire to hobby albums, but the importance is emotional: older vinyl album buyers are slightly more likely to keep their emotions hidden (56% in 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% in 66%).
But are YouGov's results true?
If this blog were a televised news broadcast, the camera would follow me as I walked along lively Soho Street, wearing a gray suit with no strings attached. I would make a lively gesture, bend my hand into a cup and say something traditional like, "Let's find out."
So let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and rudeness, while hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over before the facilities owned by private entrepreneurs, there are still a handful of specialized record stores left.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment when I look very close to the men visiting these shops and try to observe their age and character.
Glasgow Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray (as customers at that moment two young women, three middle-aged men) to the Reckless Records movement (as customers eight middle-aged men, one probably 20-year-old woman) is on a meeting trip to London for the afternoon and spends extra time getting acquainted with the supply of shops.
I'm gonna ask him if he's a collector.
"I think I am," he says.
"I have about 3000 to 4000 records."
These plates fill his living room wall, as you can see from the picture. (Stuart sent me the picture by e-mail, I didn't follow him home.)
The reason he has acquired so many albums and singles is partly in his disposable income. He is now able to buy records he could not afford when they first appeared and to buy again things he had to sell when he was young and broke.
"I got a lot of things in the late '60s and early '70s that came out when I was 11 or 12 years old and probably too young to have them," he says.
He agrees that vinyl discs are more likely to be purchased by introverts who enjoy their company, and adds: "I don't smoke, and I don't drink much.
It's my vice."
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of their customers fit the YouGov profile.
However, he has discovered a new kind of flow of people affected by media hype, who have heard of vinyl discs coming back and now feel compelled to buy their old records back.
"On the basis of my discussions, people had generally given up their collections around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their vinyl back," he says.
This can explain the boom of certain age groups of vinyl waking up.
What, though, about the alleged emotional significance of the records?
In just a few seconds, in a shop like Phonica, one realizes that they provide a comforting community for similar - minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers are particularly upset with the contactless payment system.
The digital world may overwhelm some vinyl fans to whom returning to familiar disc cases means permanence and reminding them of the happy days of youth.
"I think it sometimes fills a hole or material possessions into some kind of comfort," says Wez.
"This is how I feel about it as a collector myself, and I believe so many others.
It's an easy way to get your mind off things."
"We're like social workers!" swipes Wez's co-worker behind a stack of records.
An ICM opinion poll conducted in April revealed that almost 50% of those who bought vinyl albumin in the previous month had not yet listened to their album.
The opinion poll also reported that 41% have a record player that they never use, and 7% of consumers of vinyl have no own record player.
At this point in the news, I would probably show a serious face while browsing a stack of bossa nova collections.
The new emergence of vinyl plates is also accompanied by the "wine effect" observed by Jonny, 42, the seller of the Sounds of the Universe (as customers at that time).
"A customer recently came to the store and said he didn't have a record player, but he wants to buy a Radiohead album so he can put it on his shelf," Jonny says.
"The proportion of such customers is not high, but they still exist.
For them, materiality is more important than music.
Some of our clients say they don't have a record player yet.
They are younger, not older, largely teenage, who are just starting a hobby."
The customer base is considerably more varied in Fopp, where I will be arriving next. The store has dedicated an entire layer of vinyl plates.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The diversity of customers is delightful, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in previous movements: instead of swinging jazz, the newest synthesizer pop in Wild Beasts' sex is roaring from the speakers.
None of the customers seem particularly lonely, but it is difficult to detect a gnawing psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Pop for a few minutes and watching various albums on sale.
He's looking at things rather than shopping.
He says his income is low, so collecting records isn't possible for him.
"They cost a lot of money.
Music is easy to listen to from a computer or otherwise, but the fineness of the booze is "... he lets out a delightful sigh and continues:
"I can't explain, they're so unique."
My last stop is a shop that is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I see a bunch of teenage girls who think they're jumping at jeans, but instead they're gathering around the Polaroid cameras for a while, and I see a father and a daughter who's thinking about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left there is a staircase with a wall filled with Adele's, Jeff Buckley's, Amy Winehouse's and Fleetwood Mac's albums: a mix of contemporary music and classics, key albums for any average collection.
Nobody looks at the wall, maybe because they're just a decoration element and some of them are so high that they can't even reach them.
They're pure "art vinyl" decorating.
But given that all the means to get attention to these records may mean more money for the industry and send some customers on a search trip to Soho, there is little cause to complain.
It is no surprise that the population most likely to have more time and money than most people also has the group that spends most money on luxuries such as vinyl plates.
Although my studies show that YouGov's results are correct, at least in Soho's record stores, they do not exclude a large number of female collectors and vinyl fans, which actually exist both in record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely attached to school or work.
They certainly do not spend their Thursday mornings in berlick street record stores, browsing records and avoiding a 30-year-old television host who stares terribly and gazes at unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holker, or ice shark, is the longest living vertebrate - video report
According to researchers, the longest live vertebrate on earth is an ice shark.
According to Shark Researcher Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice shark was aged 272-512 years in the study, a female of five metres in length.
The French court rejected the application for the dismantling of the jungle camp shops
The French court has rejected the request of the Calais authorities calling for the dismantling of dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in a jungle camp populated by thousands of refugees.
During the trial this week, the Calais authorities made claims that the state should be allowed to break down the 72 temporary shops established in the refugee camp. The shops sell different goods to residents of the refugee camp from tobacco to energy drinks and offer haircuts. You can buy tea for 50 cents or basic meals for a few euros.
According to the Prefect authorities of Calais, these shops and restaurants must be dismantled because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent a grey economy and because they involve fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian aid teams told the court that shops and restaurants are essential for the camp, as free meals offered by the state - supported organization and others are not enough for the growing population of the camp.
According to them, temporary shops and restaurants often offer shelter and free food to those in need.
The Court ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of 72 temporary traders, but considered the concerns of the Prefect of Calais to be "fully understandable'.
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, camp grocery stores, cafés and restaurants are of far greater importance than merely providing food to people who are "living in extremely unstable conditions."
He says they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet.
One of the places under threat of dismantling was the Jungle Book Kids café, which is non-profit-making and offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons and asylum advice to hundreds of unaccompanied minors in the camp who are the most vulnerable.
More than 170 000 people have signed an petition requiring children's cafeteria to be kept.
According to a letter sent to Guardian, its closure would be "a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
On Friday, two charitable organizations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated that after the steep increase in summer arrivals, the population of the jungle camp has risen to a record number of over 9,000 persons.
Food prices in Finland fall clearly faster than the EU average
Food prices in Finland are sharply reduced to the pleasure of consumers and to the trouble of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by nearly 5% in three years, while the average price in the EU countries has fallen by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become one per cent more expensive.
During the last three years, food prices have fallen to other countries in Finland most in those EU countries with the same wage level as in Finland.
In the UK alone, the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are based on an article published in the Tieto & Trendit blog by Statistics Finland's Development Manager Ilkka Lehtinen.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices relative to the overall development of consumer prices.
The latest data are from June of this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose strongly.
In 2013, prices shook close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," says Lehtinen.
Then came the turn, after which food has become cheaper year after year.
The price now weighs on Russia's ban on imports of food, which has stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
This is why the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and producer prices for agriculture have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term," says Lehtinen.
The increased price competition between industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
Large retail chains The S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For the consumer, price competition has been seen as spectacular advertising campaigns.
Finland is still not a place for cheap food, though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland from EU countries with a wage level similar to that of Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the reference countries had the same VAT rate, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with similar wages.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate was seven per cent in the comparator countries, only Germans and Dutch people would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to reach the old EU level in food prices, we must halve VAT to the EU average and continue to compete for prices," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that his VAT rate calculations are indicative.
School's not exactly the same anymore.
A person returning to school may find that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a guide according to which all Finnish schools are operated.
The schools decide the details themselves, but the plan shows the official goals.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from old ones in many ways.
Among other things, the study of fiction is abandoned, while schools begin to practice coding.
Swedish education starts at the latest in the sixth grade, and social studies start at the beginning of the fourth grade.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of pupils.
It used to be thought that the teacher teaches the students, but now everyone needs to be active and learn from each other.
This is an attempt to make schooling more interesting.
The world's longest vertebrate was found - an ice shark can live for up to 400 years
Even the known Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) does not reach sexual maturity until the age of 150.
It can live another 250 years after that, report a new study.
The figures make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in today's world.
In the animal kingdom, it is passed only by an Icelandic clam whose oldest known individual is scheduled to be 507.
The Greenland shark is swimming all over the North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are one of the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than males; they can grow up to more than five meters [5 m].
Since the rate of growth is slow, only about one inch per year, adult individuals have been forced to live for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He defined the age of adult ice sharks from 28 females caught in fishermen's fishing gear.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radio carbon timing of the eye lenses.
The average age of the tested sharks was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, 493 and 502 centimeter Amazons, were found to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Since it has been found in previous studies that females of sharks reach sexual maturity by more than four metres, researchers calculated that they were at that stage around 150 years of age.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann fired almost 300 people - no reduction in salesmen
Nearly 300 employees are dismissed from Stockmann, a department store company.
Co-operation companies in a company in difficulty ended at the beginning of August.
"Around 300 jobs will be reduced as a result of the negotiations, most of which will be made redundant," Stockmann explains in his press release.
It states that the number of sellers of department stores will not be reduced in order to avoid suffering from customer service.
In addition, approximately 80 employees in support activities are offered new jobs as sellers.
Stockmann's joint negotiations concerned about 3 000 employees.
At their start, the reduction was estimated to be about 380 employees.
The population reduction aims to achieve annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are due to take place in the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
In the background are Stockmann's difficulties in making the department store profitable.
Although the Group's adjusted operating result improved in the second quarter to EUR 11.1 million, the department store trade still loses.
According to Stockmann's Acting CEO Lauri Veijalainen, sales in department stores have not reached the company's targets.
"Personnel reductions are unfortunately necessary to ensure the positive operating result of Stockmann Retail in 2018," Veijalainen says in the press release.
The second quarter's improvement was particularly driven by the success of Lindex's clothing chain.
The chain achieved its best second quarter turnover and results ever.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
During the corresponding period last year, the total operating result of the Stockmann Group was 4.1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperatures below 20 degrees across the country
The low pressure center on the northern part of Finland keeps the weather rainy Friday," says Ilona Láng, the meteorologist of HS.
There will also be showers of rain in the central part of the country, but the southern part is pouty.
The temperature is no longer very high in the summer, since mercury is below 20 degrees in the whole country.
In the rainy areas of the north, 10-15 degrees.
Kenya's Athletics Team is shaken by a doping scandal - a strange explanation for the coach's rapture
Kenyan athletic coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Olympic Games in Rio after it turned out that Anzrah was an athlete on the national team's doping test.
News agency AP reported that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is a 800-metre star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of Kenya's national team leader, reported that Anzrah's identity was revealed after giving a sample of the surprise test as Rotich.
Doping officers came in and turned Anzrah's authorities in.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because he "did his crime against Kenya's national team."
He played as an athlete, gave me a urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour', Kip Kip, chairman of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, thundered at Reuters in turn.
Olympic athletics will start on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run immediately at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth in the World Championship last year and is in advance of Rio's favorite winners.
According to Reuters, the source inside the Kenyan athletic team claimed that Anzrah was using an athlete's accreditation card just to get free meals in the race village.
When the anti-doping officers met him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken to the test.
Coach didn't explain the situation to the officers because he was afraid of being exposed," the source told me.
Where is everybody?
Rio's Athletics Stadium is pummeling its emptiness
Where the hell is everybody?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium watching athletics.
In Rio, a battle for athletic medals began on Friday, but the world's top individuals were able to show off their skills to a disconcertingly empty audience.
On Friday, Rio organizers reported that only 58% of first day morning tickets and 65% of evening tickets have been sold.
There was another one four years ago in London, where the stadium bulged about cheering people.
The final tickets are already sold out in Rio.
The loss of spectators at the Rio Olympics has attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been seen in the spectators of rugby, paddling and horse riding.
When Brazil's medals Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in legendary Copacabana, the audience was only 70 percent full.
After the Brazilian duo, the Netherlands played against Russia, with only about 30 percent of the 12,000 spectators.
At least, the bad trade is explained by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with economic problems, is far from European and Asian tourists, and many of the Olympic sports are strange for the Brazilians who are used to football.
True, even the first match of the Brazilian football team could not fill the football stadium.
The event organizer Mario Andrada told us this weekend that 82 per cent of the tickets had been sold at the time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
"There's still 1.1 million left to sell," Andrada said, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets sold at the London Olympic Games, 8.2 million were sold, even though these tickets cost almost half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around EUR 9 to more than EUR 1 000 at the opening.
More than half of the tickets cost less than EUR 16.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit empty seats, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed because organizers need money and are trying to sell tickets until the last minute.
True, in Rio, organizers have issued 240 000 tickets to school children for less well-known species such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty spaces at Rio Stadium this morning.
Not even a beach volleyball on the sand of Copacaba has interested the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London 2012.
There were a lot of people in the galleries.
A New Way to Protect Nature - Get Right to Land
Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation through new means.
Founded last year, the Foundation acquires ecologically important natural areas.
Thereafter, private, companies and entities can use money to redeem holders' rights to land.
The Foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land area is virtually divided into blocks that those wishing to acquire in exchange for the payment of the right to the holder.
The holder is entitled to a veto of 187 square metres in his block, which means in practice that approval is not required for each holder if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
Holder rights can also be acquired in several segments.
Getting the right to control is something concrete that can be left as an inheritance or as a gift.
You don't have to go carrying banners or chain yourself up somewhere to protect nature," Juha Levikangas, who acquired the right to control his company, explains.
The person acquiring the right to control will receive detailed location information from his block, which will allow, for example, a visit to the block.
On the Foundation's website, the names of the holders of the rights are displayed on the same map where the country block data can be found.
Leviekangas sees its acquisition as a risk only if the Foundation's activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a foundation of general interest aimed at promoting the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the Foundation would act in some way unethical or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The idea behind the Helsinki Foundation's Elf Project is to protect nature areas so that they can be intact and peaceful.
The Foundation acquires land either by buying or donating.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of holders' rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims beyond Finland's borders and plans to purchase land from Australia.
Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
Bike thieves torment Turku most from large cities - see the situation in your municipality of residence
Bicycle thieves torment Turku most from large cities in Finland.
This year more bikes have been stolen relative to the population than in the other nine major cities.
Helsingin Sanomat explained to the police on the basis of reported bike thefts, how many bicycles and parts of bicycles have been stolen in the largest ten cities in January to August of this year, calculated per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti took the lead.
According to police records, four to five bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants took place.
Instead, in Espoo and Kouvola, only about two bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police.
It's a big difference, isn't it?
"In other cities, double thefts occur relative to the number of inhabitants compared to others," describes Police Commissioner Tommi Reen.
The Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have the answer to that.
"The frequency of thieves can be affected by how much bikes are carried in the city and how many bikes there are at all," Sergeant Teemu Eikäs ponders.
Tommi Reen of the Finnish Police Administration thinks it is quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will take the lead in comparison.
The number of bike thefts goes largely according to what are study and cycling cities.
Turku has a dense centre, short distances and lots of bikes available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city, where urban centres are remote from each other and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of mobility," says Reen.
In all of Finland, the number of bicycle thefts reported by the police in January to August has been slightly lower than in the corresponding period of last year.
But there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police report little more than 20,000 bike thefts each year.
It means 50-60 bikes every day and in Helsinki alone about 4 000 bikes a year.
"They're large quantities," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more wheels, for only some of the victims report theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report bike theft, although fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police will be solved.
Typically, unsolved bike theft is one in which the police are informed of the theft immediately and the thief is caught in blood.
"There are also cases during other investigations, when, for example, stolen bikes can be found in the apartment in a drug case," says Reen.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly in the act itself or during police investigation," says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bikes are stolen from, for example, shopping centers' racks, courtyards, warehouses and cellars, or virtually everywhere they are stored.
As in previous years, the highest number of individual wheel models is stolen from Jojoja.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves, for example, take the bike for their short - term use, but most of the stolen wheels end up on sale online, for example.
They remain on the domestic market.
"At least it hasn't come to the police's attention that stolen bikes go abroad," says Reen.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen wheels are common Finns.
Some people probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the used wheel must be vigilant, as he may commit a concealment offence or offence.
"Alarm bells should ring if a fit wheel is sold at a clear price," says Reen.
Special Library Officer Severi Moose carries his colorful Nopsa to the shelters of the Kallio Library in Helsinki every working day.
He's had five bikes, but none of them have been stolen," Moose says. "He's never been taken, he's had a good monk."
"Maybe this doesn't attract thieves so much, this doesn't necessarily have a hipster value," the Helsinki Moose wonders.
Siiri Valve, who quickly visited the kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked his bike with a small U-lock.
Now the bike stomped against the kiosk wall, but in general Valve locks his bike in something solid, such as a bike rack.
"It's gonna be a lot of time to think about it, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," says the student in Helsinki about his white bike, whose trunk alone cost about five hundred euros.
"All the time, you hear from the guys that the bikes have been taken away."
"Mostly bad bikes, such scumbags."
A motorcycle was stolen from the home yard of the building company a year ago.
True, the bike had not been locked, so Valve could expect it to be taken.
Under 15 years of age to be held accountable for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer jurors from the United States
In Helsinki, a peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from getting into a criminal spiral.
Initially, the experiment will apply to those under the age of 15 who are now deprived of criminal responsibility.
The peer jury intervenes in the first crime committed by a young man.
The idea is that the peer jury will discuss what has happened with the perpetrator and impose sanctions.
A week later, the perpetrator may join the peer jury himself to make up for his actions.
Other consequences may include a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Juvenile Director Tommi Laitio tells us that the model is not strict.
We have other forms of conciliation which are used side by side.
"Everyone directs the youth's activities in a more responsible direction so that everything doesn't spoil the first mistake," says Laitio.
The peer jury has been inspired by the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that, after the first crime, a young person does not face an adult panel but reacts to what happened with people about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
The service design agency Palmu's service designer Iikka Lovio, who followed the experiment, says that this was an assault that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes of under 15 years of age may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It's been a message that you'll continue on the path you've chosen," says Lovio.
The peer jury is part of the Helsinki project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new approaches are offered to all those in need, not just to young immigrants.
More than 70 Republican influencers want the party to stop funding Trump's campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding the presidential campaign of Donald Trump.
The letter was reported by the American magazine Politico, who had received a draft of it.
According to the paper, the open letter is addressed to Reince Priebus, president of the Republican National Committee.
The signatories want the party's money to be transferred to the Congressional elections instead of the Trump campaign.
"We believe that the disagreements caused by Donald Trump and his indifference, incompetence and record disfavor threaten to bring a voiceslide to the Democrats in these elections," says Politico.
Only by directing all possible funds to the Congressional elections can the Republicans be prevented from drowning with a Trump-decorated anchor around their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential elections will be reduced from day to day.
Politico writes that the letter is scheduled to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is the Republican Andrew Weinstein, who is prominently opposed to Trump.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from 'people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress' and that it is not a question of supporting anyone.
The letter lists a number of acts by Donald Trump which are believed to have offended millions of voters.
Also, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for families with US children
In the United States, the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton reported on the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I'm running for president to make the American economy work well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is running for president to make the economy work well for him and his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive $ 275 billion five - year program to improve US infrastructure - roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be partly financed by tax increases for the rich, partly by private money.
The construction program is a handshake for American workers who suffer from the relocation of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme the biggest investment in high-paid jobs after World War II.
We are a builder people, we must return to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the status of working families with children.
On Thursday he sounded like Sanders anyway, stressing that the rich should pay their fair share of the taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States to become a tax refugee, it must pay the tax on departure," Clinton said.
Today he is opposed to the free trade agreement in the Pacific, which he previously supported.
"As [President] I am opposed to any trade agreement that works against employees or wages," Clinton promised.
According to speculation published by The Washington Post before Clinton's speech, Clinton was going to criticise the economic programme announced by Republican Donald Trump on Monday for "adopting only millionaires of this kind."
In the past, Clinton has designated Trump as a loophole.
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small businessman himself.
He reminded the listeners of small businessmen whose bills Trump failed to pay, and of the clothes that Trump himself manufactures in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start by making his own products in America," Clinton was picking up.
These are Rio's ratings: The games have not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile app is interesting
Usually, sports competitions are seen in television's ratings as sharp mountain peaks.
So far, the Rio Olympic Games have not reached a huge number of spectators.
At one time, the races have glued 12 percent of the population at best: Tuesday night's swim was followed by 615 000 viewers from Yle Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
By comparison, the European Athletics Championships of one month ago attracted almost 800,000 spectators at a time to TV2, and the European Football Championships of just over another million.
The most interesting of the Olympic sports has so far been Sunday evening biking and the fifth day of the competition's open rack gymnastics, both of which reached the Olympic channel at a time by nearly half a million spectators.
Yle Sports Manager Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the ratings, and reminds us that for the first time in the Rio Olympic Games, viewers are divided into several different instruments.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympic Games from Rio Arena.
We welcome the number of TV viewers who choose the Olympic Games at all.
Even on the television side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports games to which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When you get a shipment 24 hours a day, and you're gonna be watching from 20,000 to 500,000 all the time, it's a good base.
The number of spectators is smaller than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the difference in time - a large proportion of Rio's broadcasts come in Finland at night.
Another reason for a lame interest - if someone now thinks it is lame - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal in the early races, the interest would have bounced up with it.
In addition, athletics are just beginning, as well as other species of interest to Finns: sailing and riding.
According to Pokkinen, the initial number of viewers has been close to what was expected.
When athletics begins, ratings explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the games, which rose in Apple's App Store as the most downloaded free app in Finland during the first days of the games.
By Monday, the app was uploaded 150,000 times.
I'm guessing we're already about 200,000 downloads.
"We won't get the online ratings until later," Pokkinen says.
Rio Arena has not worked as hoped for all users.
Pokkinen says that feedback has come and the faults have been corrected.
The use of Rio Arena has been accompanied by delays and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
The applications have been updated to correct errors.
The Rio Olympic Games are visible on Yle channels and arenas more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
Yle Fem can be used to track some species, and Yle Speech on the radio transmits races every day.
The Olympic Games are not only perhaps the most laborious for Yle ever, but also the last ones that can only be followed from Yle channels.
From 2018, Olympic sports will be displayed on both the public and commercial channels.
How deep is Finland's deepest lake?
According to official statistics, Finland's deepest lake is Päijänne, whose depth is 95.3 metres on the Crossback.
It may be even deeper.
The technical diving instructor Matti Kannela found a weight of about 20 square meters on the crossback, and the dive computer looked 104 meters deep below the bottom.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried in vain to confirm the observation by sonar.
The method may not find a small depth in 100 metres," says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes include Lake Inari (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and Lake Pääjärvi extend to more than 80 meters.
They have not been studied as closely as Päijänne.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
"There may well be unknown depths," Kannela ponders.
If the deepest lake is defined by average depth, it is the Great Lake Juka, 23 meters.
Looking at this, the Päijänne can't get into the top ten, and Suvasvesi is farther from the top.
Correction on August 12 at 2:29 p.m.: Corrected last paragraph in which the deepest lakes were wrong.
Ihalainen veroista: The taxation of pensioners is still tighter
The taxation of pensioners is still tighter than that of wage and salary earners.
Ihalainen says that the injustice arose during the parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to employees.
This is not included in the government's proposal.
We believe it should definitely be there.
The promises given should be kept up after the election," he says to the media in the West.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received income reductions which reduced taxation.
This was heated by opposition representatives in Parliament, who grilled the then Minister of Finance Alexander Stubb for the electoral promises.
The purchasing power is secure, it's not growing
According to Ihalainen, the policy presented by Minister of Finance, Petteri Orphan, is mainly about safeguarding purchasing power and not increasing wages, since next year there will be no increase in wages.
He says that a tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen welcomes the messages of Prime Minister Juha Sipilän (in June) and Orphan, with a desire to respect the competitive agreement that has been worked out with great effort.
He says that sticking to the Treaty is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government.
It has been done by the social partners, so it should not be ruined by questioning it.
It will be necessary because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people's own faith in the future.
Picking up long-term unemployment in the raffle
The Ihalainen appeals to the government to seize long-term unemployment in the budget, at least to halt its growth.
In June, the number of long-term unemployed was around 17,000 higher than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's target of raising the employment rate to 72% will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: There are no known Finnish casualties in the attacks in Thailand
In Thailand last night and last night, at least four people died during the bombings in Finland's time.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to be alert and avoid the most busy tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists intending to visit Thailand should not cancel their trip due to explosions, but the embassy's instructions on caution should be followed," Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish travel season in Thailand dates back to the turn of the year.
The vast majority of tourists from Thailand come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook since the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach Finns in Hua Hin in particular to learn more about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be fine," Westphalen says.
No information on the author
Westphalen says the attacker hasn't been reported yet.
The ambassador believes that events may be linked to the political unrest in Thailand's divided society and to last week's referendum on the military junta's constitution.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open democratic process.
Among other things, there were arrests of people who said they were against the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, there is an ethnic-national conflict involving the Muslim population," Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today is a big local holiday in Bangkok, Westphalen says.
According to him, the city celebrates Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks should affect the day's course so that the authorities are extremely careful about safety.
Thai police: The attacks do not involve international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and are different from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been excluded, says the Thai police according to the AP.
During the day, at least four people have died in Thailand when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as tourists in Phuket and Hua Hin.
Even in a tourist destination favored by Finns, the holiday island of Phuket exploded four bombs last night, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current information, they did not require any casualties.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the paper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where, according to the newspaper, one person was wounded.
According to local authorities, a total of four bombs have exploded at the popular tourist destination in Hua Hin yesterday and today.
At least one person died in both double-bomb attacks.
In addition, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Than and in the city of Trang in South Thailand.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it travels to the resort islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
Unknown attacker
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the military junta in Thailand, the attacker is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not incite people to panic any more," he said to journalists.
According to Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, Deputy Prime Minister for Security, at least the attacks by Hua Hin and Trang are linked.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators were meant to destroy the country's tourism, because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy urges Finns in the country to be alert and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns intending to go to Thailand have no reason to cancel their trip due to explosions, but it is worth following the instructions of the unsuspecting to be careful," Westphalen says.
Europeans in wounded
So far very little is known about the attacks and their victims during the night in Finland.
There's been a little bit more information about the attack last night in Hua Hin.
A local woman died and more than 20 others were wounded, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were wounded in the latter attack of Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded near a bell tower known as the sights.
Thai PBS reports that the police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where it believes it has found another bomb.
According to the governor of the county, Surat Than's bomb was hidden in a flowerbed.
An employee of the county died in the attack.
There's at least one wounded.
The chief of police interviewed by CNN reports that two bombs were also used in the Surat Than attack, which exploded about half an hour apart.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles won the women's four-game
U.S. Alexandra Raisman was second in 60,098 and Russian Alija Mustafina third in 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, is still in pursuit of racking championships at the Rio Games in permanna, jumping and booms.
Biles has been in control of women's gymnastics to the full over the last few years.
He has eight personal world championships from the previous three seasons.
He has won the four-game and perm championships three times in a row, and the boom last year and the year before.
In the U.S. team, Biles has won two World Championships.
We're gonna have a slimmer World Championship... and we're gonna have a jump and a boom.
Thailand's Finnish entrepreneur: "The hit has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a children's play club in Phuket in Thailand, is not concerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I don't think there will be any more miracles, evaluate the Huvila, who has worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about 20 years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many tragedies near Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was the tsunami, then there was the avian flu, and last year there was a bombing in Bangkok.
If these previous ones haven't banished tourists, I don't think this has either.
The office of the villa company is located a few hundred meters from the site of the explosion.
The villa heard about the attack from its own employee.
The employee called at about 9:00 a.m. local time and said it was best not to come to the office.
The villa says that both the promenade and main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been put on for the queen's birthday," says the Huvila and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
Patong had a calm atmosphere and the main street movements were allowed to open at about ten o'clock local time.
A lot of people on the beach hadn't even heard of the attacks.
At half past half past three in the day, in Patong, the traffic had normalized and a large proportion of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the attack, the explosion has been pretty small, says the Huvila, who visited the attack site.
Later, the car was seen in the crown shop in Jouxholminte.
When the police got there, the car was set on fire.
The patrol found two men who fit the description hidden in the nearby spruce.
The other man was immediately apprehended.
One of them ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft of use of a motor vehicle, theft and aggravated damage.
The police are thanking those who gave us the clues.
Research Director for Russia's Change of Director: Clear exclusion
On Friday, Russia made the highest leadership change in years when President Vladimir Putin dismissed Sergei Ivanov, head of his regime.
Ivanov's successor is 44-year-old Anton Persecution.
He's an ex-distant. He's a second-in-command in Ivanov.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov's dismissal may be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from gaining too much power.
He adds that recycling management is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from building power independent of the President himself.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been in trouble with other leaders or screwed up.
Station drop for Ivanov
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, will move on to special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
On the tape presented by the state media, Putin said that the amendment to the joint decision was to be made.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other assignments and proposed Persecution to replace him," said Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view it is a clear drop in position.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in Russia's order of importance.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the President's Security Council.
During the Soviet Union, Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB.
He was considered a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but became President Dmitri Medvedev.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, such as governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi of the Institute for Foreign Policy says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place is that Putin changes his close friends to younger ones.
Isis fighters used civilians as human shields in their withdrawal in Syria
They used civilians as human shields to flee to the city of Jarabulus, so that we would not target them," said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were stationed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters took control of approximately 90% of Manbij's city, which is important to ISIS.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists were then left in the city.
Corrected with earlier news at 7:30 p.m.: Previously, we wrongly reported that civilians were fleeing the city, actually being abducted by Isis fighters as they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior's document disclosure policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on public access to documents is illegal," says Professor Tomi Voutilainen of public law from the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells STT that public access to documents cannot be based on the authority's own policies but is based on the law.
In the past, the Ministry of the Interior refused to hand over a list of participants for the Home Secretary's events to the Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision with instructions from the Prime Minister's Office and the fact that the information had been recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Ministry's Communications Director tells STT that the Ministry has identified the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's final Olympic show begins in Rio
Like in the past few years, Bolt has been running against time.
He insulted his buttocks from the beginning of the year and had to skip the Olympic qualifying in Jamaica.
This hasn't been the perfect preparation, but I'm in much better shape.
I have practiced well and that is the key," Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low - costing samba dancers and fan - turned journalists.
Poriina Bolt's surroundings underline that the Jamaican star has risen in a time when athletics have struggled with doping scandals and slipping interest.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he was cut off in the first 200 metres in the period 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by injuries and a loose exercise attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at a hundred meters, where he crushed the world record and the final celebration of the competitors' self - confidence, despite the time of 9.69.
This is gonna be harder.
One year later in the World Cup in Berlin, Bolt reached his career at a legal point with a clock.
The world record of 9,58 100 metres and 19,19 in Berlin is still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a world record of 200 metres and 19 seconds, but that is the only thing anyone believes in is Bolt himself.
The biggest challenger in 100 Bolt is Justin Gatlin, Olympic winner of the 100th of Athens 2004.
Last year, at the Beijing World Cup final, Bolt defeated an American with only one hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost in the finals of the Games once if he has made it.
In Daegu 2011 the 100th World Cup final was not run by Bolt because of the fraudulent departure.
Bolt's gonna be 30 in just over a week.
He's an old man in the young men's sport, and the Rio Games are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set next year's World Championship in London.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the others.
I'm older and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it," Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Reveals from Rio: two athletes suspected of drug abuse
According to Xinhua, China's state news agency, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive anti-doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
The Chinese swimmer, Chen Xinyi, found traces of banned substances in his drug sample.
Also, Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan athletic coach was sent home because he gave an anti-doping sample on behalf of an athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given an anti-doping sample showing signs of an EPO hormone.
He was fourth in the women's 100-metre butterfly suit in Rio.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has brought his doping case to the Court of Appeal of Sport (CAS).
Xinhua reports that the Xinyi sample on Sunday had shown signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping suspects have also emerged in Rio.
The BBC reports that Silvia Danekova, a Bulgarian female barrier runner, has given an anti-doping sample showing signs of an EPO hormone.
Kenya, on the other hand, has sent an athletic coach home from Rio for doping.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee, KOK, told us that the Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete in a test situation and had submitted an anti-doping sample on his behalf.
According to media records, it's a Kenyan fast-run coach, John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used Ferguson Rotich's race pass, a 500 - foot runner.
Phelps will not be stopped by anything - historical gold came in show style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swim 200 metres in mixed swimming, his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold.
At the same time, Phelps, as the first swimmer, reached the Olympic gold of the same species in four consecutive races.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino was second in mixed swimming before the Chinese Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have some fun, BBC Olympic Swimming Commentator Helen Skelton is laughing at the Instant Interview of Evening Magazine.
The story about Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read on the evening magazine website this week.
Next to Commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't stress much if there's a little noise in the social media or the British press about his revealing and special outfits.
Television is a visual media, he emphasizes.
Skelton is wearing high heels and a shorter dress with at least enough exposure - at least for the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
However, there are no steps to be taken.
It's important to look good, and little fuss is just a funny thing.
I'm sure Skelton would like to be thrilled and perhaps does, but he insists that he doesn't want to play the leading role.
This isn't about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus needs to be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine the fuss going all the way to Finland?
I can't, but anything that pays attention to how hard these swimmers work and how much sacrifice they make is okay with me, Skelton grinning.
You know what?
It is a fuss about nothing if it comes from (the host) dressing.
I'm a little amused if something like this has hit someone's radar.
The police in Rio made two arrests for a suspected terrorist attack.
On Thursday, the Rio police announced that they had arrested two people for suspected terrorism.
The police made the arrests in connection with the security surveillance of the races.
In the same context, the police committed five other arrests and questioned two persons before their release.
All suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news site, people arrested for terrorism belong to the same group that was arrested by the police as early as July.
The arrests are believed to be connected to the Isis-Radio organization.
The arrests had reportedly fueled violence in social media.
Messages to encourage violence had been distributed in the popular WhatsApp service, among others.
There are 85 000 police officers responsible for the safety of the Rio Games.

Argentina's Lady Betrayal Siren - a Finn pondered a protest
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
The wind Betrayal Siren went through a lot on Thursday.
On Thursday, in Rio, the Argentinan lady bubbled Tuuli Petäjä-Siren at the opening of the women's surf day.
The winds were clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the violation.
He got stuck because of the accident, and the others ran away," told Joakim Wilenius, head coach of Finland.
The athlete considered a protest for a long time.
Then it was not worth doing, because according to the Olympic rules it would have been useless.
I should have fallen into the water to get compensation, said the Betrayal Siren.
The Finn hung on his board until the last time because he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
The Finnish citizen was left in position of 27 with the accident.
In the overall situation, London's 2012 Olympic silver medalist is the eighth.
The accident didn't have much effect on the tip.
Friday's a big day when you have to race 10-12.
Edit 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not make a protest.
7 Special Things That Scientically Longen the Age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proved to bring more years into a person's life.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect a person's health so that his or her life is prolonged.
Sometimes things that a person cannot control can bring to him additional years.
These include, for example, a tendency to body fat or social status.
Regular shopping may extend your age.
Sometimes you don't even have to stick around... just getting a milk can is enough.
The secret of longevity has been explored through various studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the most bizarre research results.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drinking has been found to protect against certain cancers, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
A Harvard University study concluded that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a "low risk of death," especially in relation to neurological or cardiac diseases.
Again, alcohol is advocated by studies that moderate consumption - from one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of dental floss can extend a person's life by as much as six years, says one study.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents gum infections.
On the other hand, they can contribute to the emergence of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway found out how laughing affected a person's life.
The seven-year-old project watched over 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to be alive after the test ended.
Sex, when protection against sexually transmitted diseases has been taken into account, is, according to many studies, good for health.
In addition, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, merely having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years in his or her life, he or she must also have an orgasm.
Of course, physical activity brings more years, and there is no denying that.
However, achieving longevity does not require absolute dwindling.
One study at Oxford University found that women with a large butt had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their system.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality.
Whether it's an athlete or an actor who won the Oscar at the Olympics, he's more likely to live beyond the average puppy.
A lot of research has been trying to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings more years into his life.
On the other hand, some researchers suspect that longevity is due to a person's social status - which, for its part, enables recognition such as the Nobel Prize to be sought.
A study of shopping behaviour among people aged 65 and over found that a person who shops daily is likely to be less likely to be older than those who shop.
This is because it reduces loneliness when running in concrete shops.
Once again, it has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may lead to early death.
So put down your credit card - online shopping doesn't have the same effect.
Drunk drunk driver fell into a truck.
On Friday night, a serious truck and passenger car crash occurred in Southwest Finland's Koskke.
The accident took place in Koskella, in the middle of Koskentie and Sorvastontie on Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car that came into contact had drifted into the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the crash, the truck stayed in its lane, but caught fire.
The driver managed to put the fire out himself.
The passenger car went into the ditch and then over the ditch on its roof.
A woman born in 1972 who carried a passenger car was squeezed into her car.
The rescue department removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to the Turku University Hospital for treatment.
The result of the woman's breath test was 2.02 per mil.
He's a suspect in an aggravated DUI.
The mail sent loose candy to the wrong town.
Salon K-Citymarket's range of candy was incomplete because the mail had accidentally delivered part of the load to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was buying candy from Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign struck her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product shortages in loose sweets because Posti delivered our cargo to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when Posti gets the load!
So if there's no traffic in lawn mowing, the sign said.
The trader's scrambling sign is linked to the fact that Posti extended its services last spring to include lawn cutting.
The lawn mowing is available until the end of August.
Haltia felt that the sign was mainly amusing and decided to share it in social media.
The popularity of the update knocked me out.
Media representatives have also been calling all the time, and the attention this issue attracts is incredible, Hal is wondering.
On Friday night, the update of Haltia had over 700 splits on Facebook.
Elf was able to grab his own favorites in a candy bag, even though a few ladies were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the business of Posti's Business Transport Services, regretted the damage to EveningSanom.
The background is that three of the five pallets strayed yesterday to the wrong place (Seinäjoki) and we didn't leave for part delivery (Saloon) in three, but only today we took five pallets, Kaidesoja told The Evening Words.
It's the first thing you've heard about it is The Evening Words.
Teija Haltia was not indignant about the sign because she found all her favorites in the selection.
Dizzy weight loss! 30 kg lighter Lotta Backlund released a picture of her change
The comedian producer has worn out tens of kilos since the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost ten pounds as a result of a change in life.
On Friday, Lotta shared a pair of pictures of her change on Instagram.
In the spring, Lotta was on a gym course, aiming for a normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
The comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund, started his dieting work as early as 2009.
He has undergone a complete change in lifestyle and has gradually lost some 20 pounds [30 kg].
On Friday, Backlund released a pair of pictures of his staggering performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed in appearance over the years.
Backlund's pre- and post-image pair has collected several commendable comments from co-smokers.
You're gorgeous.
We're on the same trip, motivation hard! one of us is glowing.
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the project "Let's do it now."
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your photos when I'm on the same journey myself, the other one tells me.
In the spring, Lotta dropped some of the last pounds on the "Let's do it now" project.
At that time he told The Evening Magazine that he wanted to finally get to a normal weight that was ten kilos away.
During a three - month course of exercise, five pounds eventually fell.
The family of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Remembering the victim for the good of police dogs
The family of a 42-year-old woman murdered a week ago in Loviisa hopes that the victim will be remembered by donation instead of flowers and adres for police work.
Sipoo Veterinarian Station has released a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim's family's desire for donations for police dogs.
The publication tells us that the victim had worked as a substitute at Sipoo Veterinarian Station and had also completed her nursing training there.
The vet station remembers the woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, sense of humor, and unafraid of work.
Dear Friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the whole donation money goes to police dogs, primarily the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Lovisian woman was murdered in her own home yard in Koskenkylä, Loviisa.
The woman's neighbors have told Evening Magazine that the victim was very dear to animals.
He owned several animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens, and a rooster.
A 27-year-old male suspected of murder didn't know the woman, and they had no connection with her.
The killer was tracked down by a police dog, Börje, who was wounded in an arrest.
But Börje survived and is recovering.
The District Court handed down a judgment against the Post for breach of the Equality Act
Posti had no right to retain the salary of the employee who refused to familiarize the temporary agency worker, assessed by the District Court of Kanta-Häme in its judgment.
The District Court ordered Post to pay the employee most of the paid salary and EUR 2 000 in compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have withheld only part of the introductory salary corresponding to the share of the education in the entire day's work.
According to the District Court, the employee was placed at a disadvantage by virtue of his trade union activities in breach of the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with the Union for Postal and Logistics (PAU) Association Decision on the prohibition of familiarisation.
During last November's postal strike, PAU took a decision not to familiarize Posti's employees with temporary workers who break the strike.
First, the People's News.
Return Turkey to a path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, written by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (Ps.) in his reply to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In a letter earlier, the Journalist Federation asked Sipilä and Soin to express their concern in favour of freedom of expression and freedom of the press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini report that Finland repeatedly brought to Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and of expression.
Putin fired the chief of his regime - in place of the Estonian-born Persecution
Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired Sergei Ivanov, Head of the Presidential Administration, says the Kremlin.
Karl Persecutor of the Communist Leader of Soviet Estonia, Anton Persecution.
Persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
Persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council," says Interfax.
Vladimir Putin fired the chief of his administration.
According to the Kremlin press release, Ivanov, a member of Putin's deep inner circle, will be transferred to special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer and suggested Persecution to replace him," says Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in the KGB espionage.
Many considered Ivanov a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed President in 2011 before Putin was re-elected in 2012.
BBC: acquisition of ManU's giant ban - not seen in the opening of the Championship
A world record player in football transfers is not seen in the field when the English Champion League is kicked off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban followed him to England.
Manchester United's huge acquisition of Paul Pogba is on the sidelines because of the ban on gambling, when ManU opened its league on Sunday against Bournemouth," said the BBC on Friday.
According to the British media, ManU paid Juventus the Italian Society of Pogba EUR 105 million.
However, the British Football League (FA) keeps him out of the game, as Pogba left Juventus under a ban.
He received two warnings in last season's Italian Cup, and it will be a one-game ban.
That ban has been moved to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is the league's second round on August 19, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, the madness of greatness is a virtue.
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of entertainment have established the status of Flow Festival as an internationally respected event starred by the world's top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festival vagrants have typically expressed themselves in distinctive dress.
One of the main stage artists this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
Flow Festival event area is styled with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to have just the main stage and the beer tent," says the artistic director of the event Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival in Suvilahti, Helsinki this weekend has grown from a small block festival to an event of tens of thousands of visitors.
The background to the success is a simple question: What kind of event would the authors themselves like to go to?
It's quite unusual in transactional productions to think this way.
The goal is often to achieve the level of necessity and to act in accordance with official regulations," says the artistic director Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow was going to sell out again this year.
The aim has been to raise the number of visitors to the 70 000 last year by 5 000.
A number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists will be seen at the festivals again this year.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because something needs to be funded.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle that is controlled on huge routes.
That's not what we want.
During 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been expanded so that there are 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurant points and drinks bars in the semi-terrestrial area.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stage, 15 000 people's tent is the venue this year.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out in a simpler way.
Maybe I'm a bit of a megalomaniac, but at the same time, we've been able to preserve Flow's life.
If you lose it, it's not our thing anymore.
For the rock, the greatest joy and reward for the work done is that even great visions are practically possible today.
During the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, operations were highly dependent on the City of Helsinki's support of around EUR 20,000.
Last year, the turnover of the company running Flow was around EUR 6 million.
It can be used to produce "Greek things" like the construction of that 73-meter-wide tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves in distinctive dress.
Alongside the music event, we can also talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event is not consciously profiled to be particularly fashionable.
We want to stand out above all in terms of content.
Still, fashion phenomena also fit the values of Flow: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment," says Kallio.
This year one of the main stage artists is a punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer of the festival that combines indierock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because it's probably the last time she's seen at a gig in Finland.
We're all interested in history and the future.
It's not just what's on the commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good and he's been doing some damn good gigs in the last few years.
The bombs of Thailand's tourist paradise were hidden in flower pots - tourists fled terrified
In Hua Hin, two bombs exploded on Thursday night.
At least one local woman died in the attack and over 20 were injured.
Apparently, the bombs were hidden in a flower pot and blown up with cell phones.
Bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreign.
They were detonated at the same time as the tourists began to leave the bars and return to their hotels, according to Samoer Youngumran CNN, a police representative.
Since 1989, the protector of wild animals in Asia, Edwin Wiek, tweeted a picture of the attacks.
If the tweet doesn't show up properly, you can watch it right here.
At least 11 of the injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran up against me and said the bomb had exploded at the bar.
It happened on one of the largest bars," said Swedish Stuartist Emelie Olsson to Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Than.
At least one of them died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon thereafter, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, which the Finns favored.
No one was reported to have died.
At the same time, another double-bomb attack took place in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were wounded.
In addition, a bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
The police reportedly found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, there are probably rebel forces behind the bombings who are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to estimates by local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently been very active in the activities of criminal organisations involved in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new stand-by troops will go into battle first in a military situation.
In an acute war situation, soldiers are ordered to battle until several months after taking the military oath, says the Central Finn.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, the Chief of Defence Forces Training, interviewed by the newspaper, for example, of military officers serving 5.5 months in a military situation, only those who are in the final stages of their training are eligible for combat.
According to the head of training, first recruits will be assigned to the reserve forces.
No shipwreckman or reservist is told to do a job without the required training," says Sonninen.
Earlier in the summer, it became apparent that the Defence Forces will start training military personnel in immediate readiness units starting next year.
If necessary, units may be used for military operations even during military training.
Pamela Tola received huge compensations for the mold house
Actor Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough fight over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of a two-storey apartment had been EUR 330 000.
After the sale, however, a serious problem of moisture was discovered in the house, causing a health - threatening microbial growth.
The couple had to sell the apartment in condition of demolition in 2014.
The sales price had dropped to EUR 132 000, so financial losses to Tola and Waroma amounted to as much as EUR 198 000.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller there.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case both at the District Court and the Court of Appeal.
The court of appeal handed down the case on Wednesday.
It upheld the District Court's judgment ordering the seller to pay a price reduction of EUR 150 000 to Tola and Waroma.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 344 for the costs of legal proceedings and settlement of the couple.
The right moderated the price reduction slightly because some of the need to repair the dwelling had already been known to the buyers when the dwelling was being traded.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the errors revealed were more serious than what had been presented.
Tola was looking for a fit home.
At the Court of Appeal, Tola told us that the couple had been looking for a home in good condition because they did not want to take up repairs.
He had the impression that the building was renovated and in good condition and that the elements mentioned in the fitness check report were not harmful.
The physical inspection report identified ventilation as risks and disadvantages and the lack of adequate management of rain and melting water flowing along the rock surface.
However, on the basis of the discussions, it did not appear that this was an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma remained under the impression that rainwaters from the rocks should perhaps be controlled a little over a few years.
The deal was made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it turned out that the moisture problems in the apartment were far more serious than thought.
Checks carried out in 2012 and 2013 revealed microbial growth in the building, according to the Witnesses, due to both the rainwaters in the rock and the soil moisture that had risen capillaryly.
On the west side of the house, microbes - contaminated air could, according to the inspector's estimate, also enter the interior through the porch.
There was mold or yeast that allowed health risk beyond the limit values in the home care room, in the basement stairwell, in the living room windower and in the basement washroom.
The terraces were built without permission
The court also debated whether the apartment had been extended in violation of the building permit.
The court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the City of Espoo's decision to change the dwelling in breach of the permit before the sale.
For example, terraces had been built even though there were no proper permits yet.
However, home problems were central in court.
According to the Court of Appeal, the buyers could, on the basis of information received from the seller prior to the sale, assume that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no need for major repairs in the near future.
In the view of the Court of Appeal, Tola and Waroma had no particular reason to carry out a more extensive inspection than usual.
Buyers have not failed to comply with their reporting obligation, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Creepy Archive Discovery: Hundreds of thousands of women wanted to have children for the Nazis - in the register also Finns
Reporter Christopher Andersson writes in his recent article by Dagens Nyheter how the US National Archives in Maryland contain documents for microfilms covering a total of 218 500 women, all of whom wanted to marry SS men.
The majority of women are German, but also include Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian, 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to become Nazi brides.
Documents and registration cards originate from the National Race Agency in Nazi Germany.
The Race Agency was under the command of SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true of women, even more so, who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynaecological studies were carried out on women to investigate this issue.
The Race Agency studied women's backgrounds, including by studying church books.
The purpose was to make sure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women were also to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and handwritten life stories to the Race Agency, as well as good recommendations from those close to them.
The Race Agency wanted guarantees that women were "lovers of children," "savory" and "good national socialists," who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as SS men's fiancées.
The story doesn't tell us what happened to the 14 Finnish women who were found in the archive documents.
The SS leaders created a state-supported program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that each SS man should have four children, either in or outside marriage.
Lebensborn homes take care of children and their mothers born out of wedlock.
However, the program was not promoted very actively, reports the pages of the American Holocaust Museum.
On the other hand, the Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The government encouraged marriage by providing loans and supporting childbearing.
The German mother's Cross of Honor was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum's website states.
On the sixth of the Cheater Sire, the Church rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko was third in sailing at the first departure of Finnjollie's day at the Olympic Games in Rio, but remained the peak of the whole group at the second departure of the day.
In the overall situation, the church rose eighth after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to 14.
Wind Pete-Siren fought RS:X-class day slots in positions 17 and 3.
In the overall situation, Petäjä-Siren is number six.
In 470, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren were placed in 23rd place at the start of the day.
In the overall situation, the Lindgrens rank 19.
Jari Bridgehead's Satulinna was recorded with a couple of hours of sleep: "I was so hungover"
Jari Sillanpää has been a favorite Finnish artist for over 20 years.
From the bartender of the cruise ship to the Tango King of 1995, to the best sold solo artist in Finland, to the star of dance platforms and festivals, Bridgenpää continues to whip and is currently in a wild lift.
The book Jari Bridgenpää, written by Mari Koppinen, on the life of a favorite singer, was published today on Thursday.
In the book Bridgehead tells about his life and career in both good and bad.
Bridgehead's career became a total climber when he won the crown of the Tango King in the Seinäjoki Tango market in 1995.
In the race Bridgehead sang tangoes, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppanmäki had composed a tango piece for Bridgepää at the man's request, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different shape.
The Satulinna song became one of the most popular songs in Finland's music history.
The book says, however, that the recording of the song did not go according to plan: Bridgehead sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and after only a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so hung over!
Bridgehead remembers in the book.
The recording of a song that has become a huge hit does not immediately suggest that it has been sung in a hangover.
Even though I wasn't physically at my best, the print was still good.
I learned that you don't have to insist on perfection and excellence all the time.
Another incident related to the man's most popular songs, reported in the book, took place nearly 20 years later.
In 2013, Bridgehead resigned from his then partner and the case finally ended up in the texts of the You Deserve Gold song, which was published on single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered from Sarah Törmänen were not what Bridgehead would have wanted.
Bridgehead had imagined that he was making a record that tells a true story about his own life, but the words of the song about the divorce were not true; it was written on the basis of the 7-day news.
In the newspaper's news, Jar and his ex-love were told that Jari was too much partying and drinking, but Jari said it was a bunch of bullshit and it wasn't true.
According to the book, Jari called the label furiously and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and that's good.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
Eventually, 52% of the voters were in favour of the difference and 48% would have stayed in the Union, although the poll polls foresaw the opposite outcome.
Britain's economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in their determination to remain in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged for the divorce, although a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
Basic mantra of Western politics, the theme "It's the economy, stupid" of the former US President Bill Clinton's recent election campaign flew into the junkyard in the British Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when their voices weren't heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important political issue.
Economic Curly Language
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macro-Economics calls for responses from the profession to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not listened to, because this time the electorate took a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation for the loss of economic standing by economists is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the impression that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people employed, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's off the real British.
Many also have the impression that a fall in the value of the currency would be a good thing, because it will promote the export industry.
In the opinion of the economist, the electorate did not believe the economic arguments because the consensus of economists was not sufficiently expressed.
They were particularly fomented by the BBC's fairness, which allowed only a couple of percent of the economists in favour of the EU's difference to the overwhelming majority.
The hostile press in the EU were not interested in explaining the views of IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other combinations of economic power letters on the consequences of the separation.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly of economic growth, trade relations, sovereign debt, and currency.
And if the messages of economists were both listened to and understood, they were ignored because economists represent an elite with whom voters do not feel that they share common interests.
Academics such as economists would have stayed in the EU, but the message was not working in small towns and rural areas.
Immigration is an economy
The overwhelming argument of the Brexit vote for victory was about immigration.
The immigrant will take your job, the immigrant will crowd your hospital, the immigrant will take advantage of you.
These arguments work.
Every café has foreign employees.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
In every waiting room in the health center, you can see immigrants.
How much easier would a British doctor be if they didn't exist?
Every school has children from immigrants.
How much easier could the children of the real British get a place to go to school if they got rid of them?
There are foreigners living in every municipality.
How much more room would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond to them and, if they did, their responses were not visible.
Economists failed to explain that immigrants have made it possible for the British to have more jobs, fewer health center queues and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially migrants in the EU - are net contributors to British public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund prepared for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are carried out by Pertti Vanhanen from Finland.
According to him, in Aberdeen, preparations were made for Brexit in time by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B, or the victory of the EU-divorce camp, began to be better prepared a few weeks before the vote in case the result was a leave.
The concern was that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds do not normally have large liquid assets, but they could now be necessary.
We went out to raise some cash.
When the Brexit happened on 23rd, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says about Aberdeen's only open-ended daily real estate fund to which the news related.
According to the old man, the normal rate would be between 15 and 20 percent.
At that time, the value of the fund was GBP 3.5 billion.
The total value of the company's funds is approximately GBP 20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds," says Vanhanen of all open real estate funds in Britain.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was 10% or even below it.
The real estate funds were therefore prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
The funds closed the deal.
When the camp in favour of EU separation won, Europe went crazy.
However, the two weeks following the vote in the real estate market were quite calm," says Vanhanen.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was the speech by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a major risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trade.
Together, they robbed the situation and put it in the main headings of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was compared immediately to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
Snowball started spinning, and one fund after another had to close its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash collected, but it also had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the old man, they did not actually close the deal but changed pricing downwards.
In practice, he said that investors were given time to consider whether the money should now be pulled out in panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you do not now have to take your money out, it would not be worth it, because it would result in losses.
It calmed things down, and most of them canceled the report.
Since then it has been quite smooth, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks," says Vanhanen.
He points out that there has been no corresponding turmoil in the continental European funds of Aberdeen, for example.
However, there were a lot of inquiries.
Excessive attention to real estate funds
Vanhanen felt that closing down the real estate fund business received undue attention.
The open funds that were closed control around 4% of British real estate.
Aberdeen's lockdown lasted six days and the company sold less than ten properties out of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might hold on to its fund for 2017.
At present there is uncertainty in the air and economic growth forecasts have been rallied downwards, but the situation does not seem to be "crazier" for Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has brought even new opportunities for some real estate investors," Vanhanen points out.
The price of pounds and dollars is at its lowest in 30 years, with a 15% discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
A dollar-dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30 percent cheaper.
There are many willing buyers," Vanhanen says.
Brexit brought negatives to the London real estate market
At 2 a.m., things didn't look too good yet.
But at four o'clock when Pertti Vanhanen, responsible for the property investments of the British Property Fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the power word.
I realized that this is now on plan B's side," Vanhanen says in his other home in Helsinki.
He went straight to work.
London City was already fully alive despite the morning.
The TV screens normally provided for silence at the office were a source of news, and normally noisy people were completely silent when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell about his resignation.
When the market opened, all the screens flashed was red.
It was a morning you never thought you'd live," Vanhanen says.
Not that, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain's largest real estate funds, completed two real estate transactions on the day after the Brexit vote, i.e. Midsummer.
It was a mess.
However, the company had been well prepared for the alternative, so the situation was calm in a way," says Vanhanen.
Brexit vote started the repair movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership changed.
The market started to anticipate drastic bills for the British real estate market, especially in London.
London's office facilities were predicted to have a deficit of up to 20% in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after another.
Aberdeen did it for six days.
Now it's gone, but there's still uncertainty in the air.
However, it is not visible on the face of Vanhanen, who spent his last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
He thinks it is far too early to say much about what will happen with Brexit.
So much is still open: how the separation takes place and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already been first reported.
The real estate service company CBRE's data on price developments cover about one third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City office buildings, the minus was 6.1 per cent, Vanhanen lists.
The figures aren't so bad, but they're monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only in five months there have been worse figures," says Vanhanen.
All the same falls took place in the 2007 and 2008 crisis years.
It is also interesting because Brexit was compared quite quickly with the collapse of Lehman and the global economic crisis that started with the US real estate market.
The old man doesn't think the parable is quite appropriate, because now it is a domestic crisis in Britain.
It's a different mood, too.
The real estate market has not seen panic sales such as that period, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity," Vanhanen says.
There's a financial jacket. It's normal.
The repair movement could have been ahead of us anyway.
In fact, he doesn't think that the price adjustment movement is a miracle - it could have been in front of him even without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen's estimate, property prices in London and other world's top cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City and especially offices are overpriced," Vanhanen says.
So the drop started really high.
London prices have climbed for four reasons, the Vanhanen list.
Britain's economy has grown strongly, London's population has grown strongly.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last category of ownership that is becoming globalised," Vanhanen says.
New players have emerged from the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London, as a well-known city, is an easy target.
In addition, prices have been fed by low interest rates, which have forced pension companies, for example, to look for returns in new destinations.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although according to Vanhanen, the leverage has now been clearly less used than during the boom before the crisis in 2008.
Spread out, spread out.
In London the rise in prices settled last summer," says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen also began to lighten its holdings in London and was a net seller last year.
There was some sort of twist to be expected, and now it's coming.
So what's next?
It depends on how the British economy develops," Vanhanen says.
He doesn't have the courage to judge what's coming, but he says that there's probably not gonna be a shot.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a downward or steady trend ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen several movements up and down, as he has been in the real estate business since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who thinks they can handle the pits by work.
If you are well prepared for risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you've invested in one market, you're too much of a victim.
If you have decentralised, the risks are also decentralised," Vanhanen says.
S Group starts registering more closely than before
Soon the S Group will know what you are eating, as the trading group announced today that it will start collecting more detailed information about its regular customers' purchases.
Up to now, when data have been collected on the total amount of the receipt, the group will begin to collect it from purchased products at the beginning of May.
The S-Group will come after Kesko here because the information on goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, the CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the customer's consent and is used subject to authorisation for marketing.
The most efficient channel is e-mail.
Quite a few customers have banned the use of product information," says Riitala to Talousanomi.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to the S Group's registration change.
Kesko classifies its regular customers according to mere grocery purchases into ten groups.
The classification is updated monthly.
Loyalty customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The information is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product specific purchase data are collected only from the K-Group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a regular customer program and it is not planned for now.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own customer base program, 1kkösbonus, which can be joined in Selection Houses, Siwos and Euromarkets.
At the moment, we do not collect product or group-level data, we stick to the total value of the receipt.
So we know which store the purchases were made and what day and the customer's receipt total.
We haven't gone to the level K-Group or S-Group," says Commercial Director Anu Ora.
According to him, the regular customer programme will be reformed in the future, but the local store will report on it later.
However, the Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
First of all, the experiment
SOK's customer ownership and customer register has been relatively wide up to now.
In addition to personal and address information, the basic data included the profession, education, form of residence, and the years of birth of children and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role are also registered.
The date and time of purchase, place, total of purchases and payment method are recorded from the S-Front card purchase.
In addition, S-bonus partners' information has been obtained from their cash registers.
From the beginning of May, product level purchase data will start to be deposited in Sokos and Emotion chains.
On the other hand, data are currently recorded at product group level in S-markets, Prismos, Kodin Terros and ABC chains.
Customers have been hoping for a long time that the marketing could be more targeted," says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Ownership and Partner Operations at SOK.
The S Group says that it informs its customers of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data are stored in the bags, whether you like it or not.
You can check your stored data on the S Group's website.
For example, cashiers cannot access the data," says Saarikoski.
Video: Heila-puppy is Customs' latest dog reinforcement - the puppy becomes the first explosive decorator
The black Labrador retriever's cub sniffs vigorously five similar boxes lined up in the country at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long before it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs Inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog to play with its favorite toy.
From the box next to which Heila sat, a jar of shell casings fragranted to the powder gas was exposed.
Gunpowder gas is the first smell that has been practiced with Heila," says Suntio, owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and main reasons for the online trade
Heila is Customs' first dog specialising in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossing points and ports, if necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila's main job because the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused measures in Customs, and after the attacks surveillance has been strengthened," says Customs Superintendent Mikko Grönberg.
Another main reason for the training of a gun and explosive device dog Customs' tasks are postal items transiting through Helsinki Airport.
As a result of the increased internet trade, up to 40 million postal items are transiting through the airport each year, including weapons and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made some 300 discoveries related to weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives and their precursors from online shopping at Helsinki Airport.
Heila will work across Helsinki Airport.
It will investigate registered baggage and mail.
There will be great benefits in ports in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require further research," says Grönberg.
Based on Heila's performance, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosives are being trained in the future.
Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
The training of the Heila puppy is coordinated by Customs dog school in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also goes to the police and Defence Forces experts to train with Heila.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decides which smells Heila is taught to identify.
Heil will be further trained whenever necessary," says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Customs' six drug dogs, as well as the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador retriever Heila has been selected from a litter of ten puppies.
The selection criteria of the dog selected for the airport include briskness and hunting drive, as well as calmness because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntio's home, is a close colleague of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can't go anywhere without Heila at home. Suntio laughs.
Subtle orders go to Heila to know about the one-off.
The evening cameraman loses the camera cover for the fast dog, but Heila returns the soft toy guard immediately from the "irti" command.
Hard competition for working dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
Level tests are still ahead, the next October, which will assess whether the training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heilan can be seen on duty at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come and iron a dog wearing a work vest, reminds Suntio.
The cost of one working dog is approximately EUR 60000 to 70000 per year for customs.
Their working age is approximately seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to the care of their owner.
Working days may be long, from eight to ten hours, but active participations only last from ten minutes to two hours.
The owner of work dogs is a fierce competition in Customs.
The owner of Heila applied for approximately 20-30 Customs employees.
Lucky hit Suntio, who has never had a working dog before, but he has years of experience with dogs and surveillance duties in Customs.
The Mini State got its first Olympic medal - the people get the day off
The Olympic gold of Fiji, with less than a million inhabitants, in rugby, is valued so high in the country that the government has decreed August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the country's public service, the Fijian Government confirmed the case once the championship was completed.
The day off is the day after the team's return.
There will also be celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
Fiji's rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country followed the finals in Suva, the capital, where the stadium had been erected.
Normally only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them cheering," said Fiji Times journalist Maikele Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish prodigy fainted after a wild performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt at 175 kilos after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature for lifters.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has fainted many times.
No one's ever really said why.
In Rio, Tokola scored 175 kilos and 145 kilos for the rapture.
His combined score was 200 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his last push of 175 kilos, as did the other.
In the third attempt, the weights rose with the wild roaring.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury approved the withdrawal.
The joy of a Finnish buyer was echoed by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired a virola attacker Prosan - Veikkausliiga - EveningSanomat
The Rovaniemi Ball Society, playing at the Men's Football League, has concluded a long-term contract with Estonian attacker Albert Prosa at the end of the season.
We are looking for a top player in our team with power and a small threshold for coming to Finland and Rovaniemi.
Over ten players and I went through more than 50 players from all over the world.
Gradually Prosa, Coach Juha Malinen of RoPS, began to stand out as a good alternative.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flora in Tallinn, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosan is scheduled to be with RoPS on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemi people meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new attacker when Alexander Kokko, goalmaster of last season, moved to Australia.
The brave Modern Family star shrugs again: teenage star shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, the kindly Alex Dunphy of the Modern Family Comedy series, is once again blowing by showing off her gorgeous body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also his ass.
Recently, 18-year-old Winter has attracted attention by making his style and behavior considerably bolder.
The star has posed in his social media photos in very few clothes and took numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very scarce clothes.
Recently, Winter, on the threshold of adulthood, has also published several images of himself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can watch it from here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has radically changed his image.
In this case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter was undergoing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television almost his whole life and has grown up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more you show the surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has upset some of his long-term fans with his image change.
It is not difficult to guess where he will be in ten years' time, when the decline is already so severe," says one woman on Winter's Instagram.
Some of the women's fans, on the other hand, defend the actor and urge them to ignore criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what anyone else says.
You're an inspiration to a lot of women, an inspiration to a young woman.
The Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted by northern lights: In the autumn it is possible to see a fairy-tale Mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract Japanese people to start the northern fire trips from early autumn," says Visit Finland in a press release.
The main destinations for Japanese northern fire tourism are Inari and Levi.
Northern lights are the trump cards of our winter travel, and they are strongly associated with the winter of the heart and snowy landscapes.
Lapland's winter aurora trips are in great demand, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Lights Bay starts early in the autumn and continues well into the spring.
In autumn it is possible to see the so-called Mirror aurora, where the lake's surface reflects the northern lights, making the vision two times fairy tales," says Anne Lind, Acting Marketing Manager of Visit Finland.
The main target group of Visit Finland's northern fire campaign is the wealthy Japanese women aged 25-35 who live in the city and dream about tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising, among other things.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and universities in Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among Japanese people compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like clearer unique sights from Finland, and Lind says that the northern lights have enormous potential.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists have grown clearly more in Finland than in other Nordic countries.
Last year they spent more than twice as many nights in Finland as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are an interesting target group for Finnish tourism, as they spent over EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent EUR 183 per day in Finland," Lind says.
Britain had to settle for silver at rugby-7 when Fiji's championship team won gold.
The impressive success of the seven rugby games in Great Britain was shattered when Fiji won it at the finals of the Rio Deodoro Stadium on Thursday, from 43 to 7.
Fiji taught the masters a lesson in ball handling, transfers, side delusions, support games, running lines and brutal force, winning gold - if the country was the first Olympic medal in its entire history.
The loss meant silver, which was a little bit of a consolation for Britain, for it was the third silver in the country on the same day. They can be proud of their success in the first rugby-7 tournament in the Olympic sport, where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The strong victory of the South African Boxes in the 7-5 semifinals earlier on the same day could have had a negative impact on the team in the finals.
Despite this, Fiji's team in this form would have won the British, even if a 15-person team had been in full strength.
The fact that at least one British will have a gold medal on his neck tomorrow may bring comfort to Britain: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, former English rugby-7 coach from Wimbledon.
It's been quite an experience for Great Britain.
Eight years ago, they lost all the games at the Adelaide Sevens tournament at Ryan's coaching.
In Rio, they only lost one game.
Loss hurts, but progress is startling.
Fiji started excellently and presented his tackle skills to Great Britain as if for fun.
It seemed as if Captain Tom Mitchell and his team had run into a bunch of mobile buses, and the world champions took the lead at 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau crashed into the corner.
When the clock was four minutes away, Jerry Tuwai scored another goal on the right side of the goal kick.
Situation 12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's gorgeous tackle prevented the Sturdy Leone Nakarawa from scored a third goal, but it didn't slow Fiji down for long.
After seven minutes of the game, Jasa Veremvala scored a goal at the right angle, after which the UK was 7-0 in defeat.
Nakarawa scored a second goal for a follow-up event, leaving more than a minute left in the first half.
After this, Vatemo Ravouvou crashed through the more powerless tackles of the British team and crashed over the finish line.
After the ground trip, the opening period ended at 29-0.
It seemed the Fijians were born to play the rugby of seven players, while the British still play the role of apprentice.
Which is very much true.
Great Britain made major changes during the half-time period and managed to hold off the Fijians for four minutes, which was a good performance compared to the first half until Joshua Tuisova scored the goal thanks to the excellent team game of Fijians.
Dan Norton managed to narrow it down to 36-7 by scored a goal for Britain at the left corner, but the game had long since been lost to the South Sea archipelagoers, whose fans sang in the audience, waved flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire Fiji's purely joyful attitude.
Mata Viliame finished touching the Fijian cake by scored a goal in the final moments.
The whistle rang, the Fijians embraced each other and the British fell into the field, completely crushed.
Earlier in the day Fiji had won Japan's semifinals by 20-5 and Great Britain had limped past South Africa in a tight semifinal where the balance was settled by the UK goal kick.
Kyle Brown took over the South African Boxes at the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with his dazzling footwork and crashed under the goalposts at the second half.
Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony Watson, England's 15-player rugby team player, sealed the victory and finally the silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to row gold
This is as emotional as gold could be in these races.
From the first bet to the last, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning rowed 220 victorious bets into history and found an added purpose for their golden moment in Estaci da Lagoa.
Although the two were in the oars, the third sound of Coach Robin Williams was echoed in the boat, encouraging them to enter their second consecutive Olympic gold in women's two, making them the first women in the history of British sports to achieve a similar achievement.
Their superiority was undeniable, their victory was already 39 in a row and once again record.
What we see, two brilliant athletes gliding on the water surface like swans, does not fully match the nature of success.
Behind every rowing gold is a large number of helping hands, each of which has contributed to the two's achievement. However, the most important of the assistants is the coach, who 30 months ago was diagnosed with cancer and who did not know if he would see this day.
According to Williams, the situation at the time was tight.
"I had bladder cancer, and the tumor could be cut away.
If it weren't for surgery, it would've spread everywhere.
And it would have been pretty bad.
It's gonna change the way you think a little bit."
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The triplet was lucky that Williams was able to start his treatment outside the season of the species at the beginning of 2014, when the interruption caused as little harm as possible if you could say so under such circumstances.
"I needed money, so I had to heal quickly.
It served as an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I walked around section 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said that a few steps is enough.
That's where it starts.
Rowing itself is already a journey, but this made it a little bigger."
Immediately after victory, the two were in Williams, who had spent a nervous morning talking a little more than normal in trying to overcome his own anxiety.
Captain Stanning of the Royal British Artillery Regiment, who had a tour of Afghanistan behind him, says: "I have been in ruins this week, which may be a little extreme, but it means so much."
"It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we've worked together with Helen and Robin.
For the past three years, Helen and Robin's cashier have been fantastic.
If it wasn't for Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so thank him so much, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have hoped for a better person to train with or a better coach."
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in the last five years.
The duo has found an overwhelming rhythm that their rivals have failed to match.
Even at the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Danish duoes began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had additional resources.
"We were very close to the moment.
Helen said, "Stay with me, stay with me."
It is very important not to drift off the path."
"We were able to leave well, and at the same time we did not try to do anything wonderful.
We didn't aim for the heavens today, we just wanted to make a good row and win the race we did."
The duo thinks about a year before he decides on his future.
Glover's gonna be celebrating next month with Steve Backshall, a friend of the TV's nature shows.
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last race.
It would have brought too much pressure."
"After London it took about six months before I realized I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
This time it took about four minutes to figure it out.
This feels so much better," he says.
Iceland will change the government wallowing in Panama leaks
Iceland will hold the early parliamentary elections in October, which are already required by the protesters enraged by the Panama data leaks in the spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed that a number of Icelandic politicians used tax havens to circumvent taxes.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but that was not enough for the demonstrators.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn at that time.
The election day has now been decided on October 29th.
Analysts say it is difficult to predict how much the people's last spring rage will affect the election results of the autumn.
In June, the presidential elections showed a clear critical attitude towards those in power, and Gudni Johannessson, who was elected from outside politics, was elected president.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of Isis.
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump withdrew his latest chatter.
He said that he was sarcastic in claiming that President Barack Obama, who was sitting, would be the founder of the terrorist organisation Isis and democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, who was involved in setting up the organisation.
The Democratic Party was furious with the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
You should never let anyone who can sink so low, Clinton tweeted.
In the south of France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of a burkini bathing suit favored by Muslims on the beaches, reports among other things the British Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that access to beaches and swimming is prohibited for all who do not have a bathing suit that respects good manners and secularism.
The decision also states that bathing suits which exaggerately express religious connections can increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating French National Day.
At the end of July, two extremists connected to ISIS attacked a church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
The quality of swimming waters in the Oulu region passed through the sieve - Pyyykösjärvi's blue algae moss
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only blue algae debris has been observed on Lake Pyyykösjärvi's bathing area.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environmental Action took water samples from nine EU beaches in the Oulu Region and 30 other public bathing areas.
Apart from Meriniemi beach, the concentrations of E. coli and gastro-intestinal enterococcal bacteria in all bathing waters in all bathing areas were below the limits laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The water concentrations of E. coli and enterococci were confirmed on Wednesday, when the bacterial concentrations had fallen below the action limits.
The blue algae ooze found on the shore of Lake Pyyykösjärvi does not yet make the water unswimable, but under favourable conditions the situation can quickly turn into a blue algae bloom, creating blue green algae on the water surface in boards.
The environmental action will monitor the situation with frequent inspections.
If the blue algae mold turns into blue algae bloom, this will also be reported separately on the bathing area's notice board.
See here for the results of the bathing water samples.
MTK's Hakkarainen forest gift reduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside
Forest gift reduction is one tax change in the Ministry of Finance's draft budget for next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax deduction to be granted on the basis of a gift tax on the generational change of forest holding.
The Ministry of Finance's proposal to reduce forest gifts has four objectives: to promote the generational changes of forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase forest space size and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
A forest owner would reduce the pure capital income of forestry.
The idea of making such a tool to promote the generational changes of forest farms is good in general," comments Juha Hakkarainen, Chief Forest Officer of the Federation of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, Mr Hakkarainen finds something to criticise in the motion for a change in taxes.
The forest gift reduction is presented to the forest owner for pure capital income.
It is capital income minus all other deductions.
MTK and Hakkarainen consider that the effectiveness of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the sales income of wood.
The VM's proposal assumes that a reduction in the pure capital income of forestry will prevent the loss of the capital income of forestry from being deducted from other taxes.
Such a person would gain a tax advantage even if he didn't sell wood.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner cannot perceive it," says Hakkarainen.
In addition, he said that only a small number of forest owners are concerned.
The limit on the tax deduction linked to the yield value of the forest is EUR 40 000.
He thinks it's too high.
As such, he says, it eliminates 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners from the scope of the reduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10 percent of the forest ownership," he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of increasing the size of the farm.
According to Hakkarainen, the reduction in forest gifts has been dragged into forest policy for decades.
It is driven by the ageing of the forest-owners.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful hailstorm surprised the drivers at Himanga - two cars went into a ditch and bumped into each other
There was a special retreat on Kalajoki Himanga on Friday morning.
According to the Rescue Department, two cars driven in a row fell into a ditch, after which the one behind crashed after the driver.
According to the on-call firemaster Harri Tipper, derailment is suspected to have been caused by a severe hailing.
There were two people in the car behind, both of whom were transported to the hospital for medical treatment.
There's no further information on their injuries.
The driver of the car driving the above was not injured.
An accident occurred on Highway 8 from Himanga a few kilometers to Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments.
The findings of the Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska's research team show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases the malignantness of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of cancer could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue around the cancer to the normal soft tissue.
In the future, it may be possible to improve the effectiveness of anticancer medications by focusing on the interaction between the cells and the surrounding tissue.
The results of the study have been published on 4 August in the prestigious magazine Nature Communications in the field of cell biology.
Muhos's family homicide continues at court, the prosecutor demands a murder sentence for another perpetrator.
The threshing of Muhos' family homicide continues at court for both convicted.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for a family homicide in Muhos.
One received eight years for four months for killing and aggravated robbery, among other things, as a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The convicted person was also convicted of aggravated endangerment of road safety as a young person and of driving a vehicle without rights as a young person.
The district court's judgment was appealed by the prosecutor, the plaintiffs and the man who was sentenced more severely.
The prosecutor demands that a man who has been punished with a lesser sentence be sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder committed as a young person.
At the time of the act, they were in full agreement.
According to the District Court, 17-year-old young men killed a man who worked as a counselor for the Child Welfare Unit at a school in July last year.
A 17-year-old who was convicted of murder attacked a director from behind on the couch in the living room.
The director had gotten out of hand and trampled the young one into his room when one of the young ones hit him with a vacuum tube.
Among other things, the director was strangled, beaten, and kicked in the head.
According to the state of mind survey, both convicted persons were fully in agreement at the time of the act.
According to the court, young people had planned to escape from the family home, at least since the day before.
The ice shark is the world's longest-lived vertebrate, increasing only at 156 years of age.
The longest living vertebrate in the world has been confirmed by an ice shark," says a study published in Science magazine.
In the north of the Atlantic, such as the ice shark that swims around Greenland, or holkeri, can live up to 400 years old.
The female doesn't reproduce until she's 156.
The life span of an ice shark is increased by the fact that it only grows one inch a year.
Only one species of bivalve molluscs are known to live longer than an ice shark.
Scientists discovered age by radiocarbon timing.
Because of nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive traces.
They enabled scientists to estimate the age of sharks.
An elder's age was estimated to be 392 years - although throwing one way or another could be as much as 120 years.
Donald Trump as an economic wizard - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need anything else in the world.
Up to one third of the State's total tax revenue would not be received if the change in corporate tax promoted by Donald Trump were implemented.
Tax revenue would also be reduced, especially with tax reliefs that benefit the richest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it on Monday in Detroit.
The company tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
There would be an enormous amount of money uncollected, a thousand billion dollars a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39,6, after the discount offered by Trump 33.
The inheritance tax would be abolished altogether.
Trump accused the state of overregulation of business and of bankrupting small businesses.
The environmental standards that have been decided upon must be renewed and energy regulation abolished.
The health reform of Barack Obama must be re-examined.
The administration must be appointed "experts instead of bureaucrats."
According to Trump, "destructive" trade policy is one of the main causes of the US problems.
Free trade agreements would be terminated.
Imports from China would be taxed at 45% and Mexico at 35%.
We're offering you a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our creed," Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes will unite cities, American ships will control the seas, American steel will raise new skyscrapers throughout the country.
Unlike their customs, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by the assistants, even though it was interrupted 14 times by well - organized protests.
Economists - including those close to the Republicans - see the Trump programme taking the United States into a deep economic downturn.
Hillary Clinton released her own program early on Friday in Finland time.
An Attack from the Past - People's News
The sea is bewildering fatally, but the actual tidal wave strikes in the middle of Madrid's street traffic - accounting with the past can begin.
That's the essence of Pedro Almodóvar's new story.
Almodovar's previous steering work Travel lovers (2013) was a funny satirical comedy on the ronski side, the pre-Season where I live (2011) as a Spanish artist.
On a level basis, Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between the two works.
It is the serene love, relationship, and family drama of a conciliatory woman whose focus is the relationship between mother and daughter.
The story is simple and seen as a long flashback.
Life seems to be in line with the middle-aged name person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of the occasional encounter, the new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) may be amazed to the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julie times the stages of her life to her adult daughter.
He begins with the time before his daughter was born, the moments when he met his future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, the young teacher of Julieta, will take up the second female lead, a TV familiar from the series Ommelte time (2013-2014).
Julieta's ageing has been dealt with in a way that can be regarded as a lump, but I would say that it is quite cleverly and literally a single wipe.
The Almodóvar films are often so marked by brittleness, up to humor in Julieta.
It is an even - powerfully played, restrained, in some places a good musical movie, and quite saddened, with the elements of elegance.
On the other hand, the visual saturation typical of the Spanish director is still present and begins to poke the eye in a pure form rather than a functioning dramatic power.
People in the film are afflicted by sickness, death, or just sudden losses, but the surface remains equally Korean.
This is particularly true of clothing: in the case of a name person, the costumes change from one scene to another, and the same applies to visible earrings.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main point, i.e. the tunes of the scene in question, do not improve in particular.
Mechanically, the impression is outward and slightly inanimate.
Almodóvar has written a script based on the three novels of Alice Munro, a Nobel Prize winner in Canada in 2013.
The novels have been published in Vankulainen: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in the writing production of some flat-rate literature.
Emotionally, there would have been more than enough material for drama, so much of the big things - especially the gnawing guilt - in the movie's theatrics.
Control and script: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on Alice Munro's three novels.
Starring Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The opening night of the film is 12.8.
The government is trying to win the election - People's News
No further cuts will be made, the glaring ministers, so that the basic Finns will not completely collapse.
However, the cuts decided in the spring are being made by a lot of people.
There won't be any more surgeries.
The four billion savings already decided will be enough.
This is how Prime Minister Juha Sipilä and Minister of Finance Petteri Orphano (Econ.) are convinced under the budget line.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM's proposal, since the cuts in social security were already decided at the spring framework.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index are cut by 0.85%.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment benefit is reduced from 500 to 400.
The training surgeries continue.
Municipal elections haunting
Why do ministers insist so strongly on the fact that no further cuts are made on them?
Because next year is an election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and are the most important thermometer in the parliamentary term, not polls.
In the past, it has been seen that the results of the municipal election that takes the government parties in different directions spoil the atmosphere of the government for a long time.
The polls, however, say that the government party's basic Finns are facing a smudge loss, although the result of its previous elections was modest at 12.3% compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns of Basic Finland received 752 new delegates, most of which next spring will realize the cost of influencing the right-wing government.
The lifeline of the government of three parties of about equal size depends on the perks of the Finns.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted for the party had had enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's fermentation have also surfaced.
There will be no further cuts, firstly by blurring the fact that next year they will be made violently and secondly by trying to soften the waiting blow for the Finns.
Big surgery in 2018?
In a year, everything will probably be different... if Sipilä's government is still standing.
The government has set itself the goal of retiring debt during this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orphano's draft budget will next year be EUR 5.9 billion in debt, which is more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to get your hands up in the middle of the parliamentary term and to admit that the government is unable to comply with its own programme: the debt will not break down or even slow down.
The other is sticking to the program.
It means new even harder cuts on top of the previous ones in the 2017 budget run.
The budget would be run at least close to balance during 2018 and then in spring the parliamentary elections will receive what comes next.
These measures will not allow debt to be reduced.
It is quite clear that the current measures do not allow debt to fall, even though Juha Sipilä is trying to stimulate a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäki at the briefing of the budget prove this irresistibly:
World economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. the international economy will not become a veto.
The Finnish economy has hardly risen since the collapse in 2008, except during the temporary recovery policy in the beginning of the 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% in this decade and has prolonged from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion more per year than in 2008.
On the curves presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60% threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt recovery presented by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost around EUR 6 billion, which will in practice be covered entirely by new debt.
This is the idea of the Centre, the Coalition Party and the Basic Finns as to what is responsible.
Question: People want to leave a lot of tasks to municipalities
Three out of four consider that the organisation of day care for children, youth work and physical activity is the responsibility of the municipality, as shown in a study by the KAKS - Municipal Foundation.
A clear majority of the population will also pass responsibility to individual municipalities for libraries, culture, civic studies, building supervision, upper secondary school education and waste management.
The province, for its part, is most likely to be responsible for regional planning, special care, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for people with disabilities.
None of the tasks entrusted to municipalities are to be transferred to the State.
At the end of the chase, a minor drunk driver ran away from the police.
Joensuu's 16-year-old motorcycle driver drove from a police patrol in Joensuu on Ilomantssintie on Friday night at half past one.
A police patrol tried to stop a motorcycle without lights, but a young man took off driving the police at a fair speed.
The chase continued to the Sonkajanrantie, from which still to the Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drifted off the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but a faster - legged policeman ran to catch the fugitive.
The breath test performed on the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a driver's license to drive a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, among other things, as a serious endangerment of road safety.
A truck in a rock truck crashed in a ditch.
A truck in a rock truck crashed in a ditch on Lake Polvijärvi at 9.15 p.m. on Thursday night.
The truck had drifted left in a curved bend out of the road and fell on its side in a ditch.
The rescue department pulled the injured driver out of the crashed truck through the door above, together with the emergency helicopter staff and paramedics.
It was left to the car owner to lift the vehicle.
From a fallen truck, hydraulic oil spilled onto the road that the rescue department absorbed into the turf.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared this afternoon at the Ilmajoki River.
Since this afternoon, an 87-year-old woman has been missing in Lahti village in Ilmajoki, South Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for a woman about five inches long, slim, and good - posture with white hair that extends under her jaw.
Observations and tips on the missing person's movements are requested to call the tip number 0295440513 of the Ostrobothnia Situation Centre.
The elements of a major accident in the air - look at the picture gallery about the damage to the Parafest
The crash flow that knocked down the tents of the Parafest Festival caused massive damage.
Arto Pepperi, president of the Parafest Association of Joensuu, estimates that the festival will get on its feet financially, and the event can also be held next year.
Kalle Salonen, the last performer of the parafest, performed at the market stage at the end of Friday night.
On Saturday, the program will continue with performances at the city theater premises starting at 1 pm.
The art center in Ahja has a Parafest exhibition between 1:00 and 3:00 p.m.
The programme will be organised as planned.
When rainwater and its weight trigger a falling air flow, the flow is generated in a lightning cloud.
The changes in the shape of the water in the thunderstorm bind the heat, and so the falling air mass cools down and its speed toward the earth accelerates.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that several crashes occur in Finland during the summer.
It's hard to predict the route of the surges.
The crash flow struck the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum at the scene of Parafest on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents were overturned, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
In the accident, four persons were slightly injured.
There was one child in the group who was transported with a slight injury to follow-up treatment.
Air Pollution Ages Londoners
According to the study, Londoners' skin age faster than usual.
The cause of skin ageing is air pollution.
The British study is reported by Evening Standard.
British skin care company Caci analyzes the most toxic particulate matter in London air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that many retired Londoners have two and a half years older skin than, for example, those who live in rural areas.
Small particles that age the skin are very fine dust pollution from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, kill almost 9 500 Londoners each year.
Studies have shown that particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac's study found that early ageing is a risk, especially for Londoners who walk around crowded streets on their way to work.
London residents may try to protect themselves against air pollution, for example, with different masks, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
The tractor's brakes failed... pushed the man standing in front.
The man had moved stones in his yard on a tractor.
After he got out of the tractor and went in front of it, the brakes of the tractor failed and the tractor ran over the man.
The man was not hit by it, but the tractor was able to push the man enough to be transported to the central hospital for further research, seriously injured.
The tractor couldn't run any further because it bumped into the rocks in front of it.
A new strife for the coming season
The Joensuu League-Riento, playing at the volleyball Championship, will start with a series of better starting points than male memory.
The team's been together for almost three weeks now.
The common tone can be found with certainty better than in previous periods, when the beginnings of the series have been gloomy for Rieno.
Jani Säsä, who continues as the head coach of the run-up, says that the new team is enterprising and united.
Fred Musoni, the middle fighter of the foreign trio, starts his second season in Rieno.
The new face is a 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson on the Rwandan national team is a six-inch picker.
Garchet's a passer, the Brazilian has a measure of 198 centimeters.
Through Josba, Kataja and River Boys to the US national team
Anne Jumpkinen has played at almost all the World Championship Championships since 2003.
Now Tampere is already in the sixth race, only 2013 missed after Canada was better at North American qualifying.
I worked in Turku and played with women there when I noticed the announcement.
U.S.A. was setting up a national team for the salibandy.
I got interested, and here we are, Jumpinen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York City in Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was a year old.
In 1987, Jumpanen reached the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, there wasn't a sport like that played at SM level yet like a salibandy.
The e-mail was played in college.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in Jokipoj I played hockey in the Finnish Championship, Jumpinen remembers.
Jumppanen played the Finnish Championship series with the university in 1991-92, the following three seasons passed in Josba.
In addition to playing, he coached the club for the A-girls championship.
Women's Finnish Championship career culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumpkinen played in the Finnish Women's Championship series through 10, with a balance of 169 matches 51+34=85.
The most recent Finnish Championship period is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tattu Väänänen were appointed to the national team
Joensuu's club, Josban, was raised by Perttu Puska and Enola-based Tatu Väänänen was selected to join the Finnish national team, playing at the Czech Brno EFT tournament on November 6-8.
In Helsinki, the attacking 25-year-old Perttu Puska has played this game before six men's ground games where he has accumulated a total power score of 9+4=13.
The 32-year-old defender of the Swiss Wiler-Ersigen, Tatu Väänänen, has recovered from the femur and is part of the regular team's standard equipment with 117 ground games experience.
The national team was also named Mika Kohonen, the conqueror of the Seinäjoki Gambling Brothers, who was last seen in the Finnish T-shirt at the World Cup last December.
Petri Kettunen, from the Gulf of Kontio, is the main coach of the Salibandymaa team.
Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM gold is missing in the prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is quitting as a beach volley player at least temporarily after the current season.
Beach volley Finnish championships will be decided this weekend at Kouvola Sports Park.
During three days, medals are played in a series of adults and young people.
In cooperation with Kouvola Volleyballers and the Finnish Volleyball Association, the top six pairs of each series will qualify for the Finnish Championship final tournament.
The local color of the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, raised by Elimäki NMKY, who has been a member of Finland's beach volley peaks for several years now.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to playing games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get to the audience this weekend.
I'm sure there's a great arena coming to the nest stadium.
I haven't played in the adult series very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals at home," Hasu feels.
The Kouvola region lit the Hasu spark for sport and gave good food for a fine hobby.
There's a lot of memories of childhood in mind.
I started volleyball when I was nine years old in the E-girls of Elimäe NMKY.
The top of the mind is too big a jersey, knee shields rotating in the ankles, and huge ace screams and choreography after the point," Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The group spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were heavily involved - the teammate's father coached us and our mother was the chairman of the club for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volleyy was a natural choice of species in return for an indoor volleyball.
There's been a song played at the Kierrälampi beach since the 1990s.
At the kukski, activity has always been active.
I also went to see the juniors' Finnish Championship sectionals myself, thinking that one day I'd be out there playing.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays together with Anniina Parkkinen at the Finnish Championship Finals this weekend.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second tough two in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We still haven't got the prize closet, Hasu throws mysteriously.
The weekend in Kouvola may be the last one for Hasu in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges are awaited in the field of civilian work.
Yes, the international career is over after the tournament at Kisakallio.
By the way, the toes are put on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu is planning.
The crash flood knocked down tents at a disabled event in Joensuu, a major accident was near

Salomon Koli boldly went into farming
Agriculture as an entrepreneur means risk taking, sweat and energy.
A young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became a farmer because he believes in a positive future also in rural areas.
Soon two years ago, Koli, together with his younger brother, Valtteri Koli, began working as a successor to their home space.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises the brothers in his own experience.
Beginning as a rural entrepreneur meant taking debt and increasing the size of the space so that bread could come into hand from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always been happy at the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I've put it all on the line.
If you start something, I think it needs to be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we set out to build a garden house, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
However, I was very boldly involved in the project, and I have been fully involved in it," says Koli of Solomon, adding that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything would still be good.
Solomon Koli, who grows cattle, aims to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has been successful, as Salomon Koli has been selected as the top ten in the competition for young food producers in Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible victory.
He can be voted on the magazine's website until 21.8.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, Bulgaria's monthly inflation was 1% in July.
This is the highest value for many years (after June 2012) and the first time it has risen to more than zero since October last year when the country reported a positive inflation rate of 0.2%.
The average annual inflation measured by CPI over the last 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) compared with the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015) was -0.8%.
The Consumer Price Index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. 1.0% per month.
The rate of inflation since the beginning of the year (July 2016 per cent compared with December 2015 per cent) has been -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month in July 2016, rising prices for the following categories of consumer goods were observed: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), vehicles (1.8%), recreation and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, domestic appliances and fixed-term maintenance (0.5%) and health (0.1%).
Prices for the following product groups remained at the same level as for the previous month: alcoholic beverages and tobacco, dwellings, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
Snapchat's anime effect is criticized as an Asian caricature
Snapchat says that this filter was inspired by anime, but some observers consider it racist.
With the Snapchat lens tool, about 150 million daily users can change reality and play with identity in ways that approach absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character in Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lens are unpretentious, distorting tools to create over 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All missteps quickly come to the public's attention.
The Snapchat lenses have received criticism where they have been accused of favoring blackface makeup or bleached skin shades as a beauty ideal.
So when it offered some of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes crooked, twisted their teeth and made their cheeks chubby, some critics called it racist caricature of Asian people ("yellowface").
The critics also wondered whether these repeated conflicts were indicative of a greater problem with the company's differences.
News and rage spread widely on Wednesday and online publications The Verge and Motherboard wrote about it the day after Snapchat told us that he removed the filter.
The company explained the following: the lens was intended as a tribute to anime characters, not as a caricature for Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of insulting stereotypes.
Some of them vehemently denied anime parable.
Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani, whose tweets were widely distributed, said in her e-mail that the lens was "at least offensive and awkward."
He adds: "It is difficult to deny that a very tasteless Asian caricature is equated with filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not just a "yellowface" but a "degrading extreme" one.
Snapchat is not the only company that has to avoid these cultural traps.
In American culture there seems to be an endless struggle for diversity and social inclusion from corporate governments to Hollywood and equipment that we carry with us.
The public in Snapchat is made up of young people with more ethnic backgrounds than their older counterparts. This may mean that they are likely to expect more sensitivity.
"When one of Snapchat's lenses creates a picture that offends the user, these types of things are no longer easily overlooked, as before," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
Zhu, who works as Product Manager and Designer at the Medium publishing platform, decided on Thursday to remove his Snapchat account and encourage others to do the same.
In an article and telephone interview published at Medium, he said that he believed that ethnic conflicts reflected the lack of appreciation for diversity in Snapchat recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the company's predominantly white and male leadership and concluded his essay with hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It is either the case that there are no colored people on their one-sided staff who can make decisions like this, or they have colored employees, but their position is not such that they dare to express their opinions directly and easily," says Zhu, a Chinese-American.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to reply.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its staff, on the basis of its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic background of its staff, but according to its publicist, the company has recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented groups of people and the promotion of inclusion within the company.
For their part, Zhu says that he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to say that this is not OK."
According to the Congressional Expert Group, military officials were perverting intelligence on ISIS.
On Thursday, a report was published by the Congressional Expert Group that officials from the US armed forces, the Central Command, amended intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war against the ISIS in Iraq and Syria than the events on the ground gave cause to understand.
The Republican presidents of the Sub-Committee on Intelligence and Defense Resources of the U.S. Chamber of Defense Committee set up a working group whose interim report reported the "general dissatisfaction" of military intelligence analysts.
Central Command, in brief Centcom, is the United States Armed Forces Headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which is responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Inquiries accepted by Centcom's senior leaders generally gave a more positive picture of US counter-terrorism activities than the facts showed on the ground, and were invariably more positive than what was reported in the analysis of other intelligence entities," reports a press release on the report.
"The events in Centcom are unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when high-level politicians are presented with false analyses," says Ken Calvert, Republican representative of California.
"Centcom's management errors extend to the highest level of the organisation."
The 10-page report describes in detail the ongoing problems encountered in 2014 and 2015 by the Central Command's descriptions and analyses of American efforts to train Iraqi troops.
Although the report does not contain conclusive evidence that reports commissioned by Obama's administrative authorities have been falsified, it gives an impression of analysts suggesting that Centcom's leaders had pressured them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by Isis.
"In the first half of 2015, many of Central Command's press releases, statements and statements to Congress were far more positive than what really happened," says the report.
"For example, Centcom's official made a public statement that a major military assault on Mosul could take place already in April or May 2015.'
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under ISIS control.
"After months of research, this is very clear," says Kansas Republican representative Mike Pompeo in a press release.
"From mid-2014 to mid-2015 U.S. military top intelligence leaders manipulate intelligence results to minimize the threat of Isis in Iraq."
The Republicans set up a task force after learning of the suspicions raised by analysts that intelligence on ISIS had been manipulated.
The report published on Thursday will be followed up by more detailed results as the studies will continue.
In addition, the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence has launched an investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, the democratic members of the Committee for Parliamentary Intelligence published their own results, which were partly in line with the conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a process that was too limited to assess intelligence on ISIS and Iraqi security forces," says Adam B. Schiff, the Committee's high-ranking democratic representative.
According to Schiff, this process "delayed the publication of intelligence results, "fellowed the morality of analysts" and "considering inadequately divergent views."
However, according to Schiff and Democrats, there was no evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom's analysts to adapt their conclusions to a "predestined or political official line'.
News site Daily Beast reported on Tuesday on the preliminary results of the Congressional investigation.
Last August, the New York Times reported on the investigation of the Pentagon Superintendent, which was initiated as a result of actions brought by Centcom analysts.
The Pentagon spokesman, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, says in his press release that the Department of Defense will not comment on the Congressional report as long as the Superintendent's investigation is ongoing.
However, he says that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a wholesome dialogue on these key issues of national security."
The investigation has other repercussions besides seeking to determine whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (an argument put forward by several defence authorities).
However, the allegations made last year questioned how much President Obama can trust the Central Command and give honest assessments of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Centcom's intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study according to which President George W. Bush's government, despite the protests of many analysts, supported only small troops in Iraq and spent little time discussing what would result from the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against ISIS intelligence.
According to the authorities, last year the Hooker Task Force concluded that, despite opposing public statements, air strikes at Isisi-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group because it had built temporary refineries and had thus been able to sell oil on the black market.
However, the results of the study were not transmitted outside the Central Command, reported The Times in September.
The then commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised last year after many legislators had estimated that the testimony given to the Senate was too positive about the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel as Commander of the Central Command.
The United States wins the fourth duel in women's field hockey and consolidates its position in the dispute with Britain
After scored three goals in a winning game, scored 6-1 against Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team on Thursday, when the United States won India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had ever done the same thing before.
"I have no idea," he says.
"I don't belong to people who keep track of the paint they do."
However, he knows this: In his Olympic tournament, the Americans have won four games and lost zero games and share their first place with Britain, which continued to win its winning streak on Thursday with the Japanese numbers 2-0.
Britain and the United States are playing against each other on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams survived the final game, which determines which one of them is the first and which one is the second of the six teams.
The first-ranking one avoids a longer run-in with the hard-core Dutch team that won the second block.
Despite Saturday's game, the Americans have already stirred up their surprising success in these games, four years after it was the last of 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on the team in London too.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and first grabbed a field hockey bat when he was only 3 years old (his older twin sister played the sport in Drexel). He was on the national team when he was 16 and was the youngest national team player of all time.
He missed the 2008 Olympic Games when he failed to make it to the final list of players.
Then came the 2012 races where he and his team had little success.
The following year Craig Parnham of England was appointed coach, after which things began to change.
"The change was cultural, spiritual and physical," says Bam.
"Our pace of work in London was not what it is now.
We've turned around."
Thursday night Bam opened the goal account at the first half by hitting the ball close by with a bump.
India had entered the game without any tournament wins, but it turned out to be a surprisingly tough opponent and maintained a 1-0 situation until the third period when Bam stepped into the field.
Bam carried the ball for a long time along the left side of the field, squirmed into the center field, hit the ball to the finish line, thus taking the Americans 2-0 to the lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the last goal in the middle of episode four.
The game was the first in the tournament where the US goaltender Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games the Americans had sunk one hit each.
Briggs is now in his season of success.
As well as Bam.
"Our commitment is now good," says Parnham, but how good it depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
In the middle of the Olympics, a trampoline brings zen
Regardless of the location and time, the Olympic Games are bound to be hit.
Rio de Janeiro's events, competitions and struggles seem to follow as a passionate message constantly and everywhere.
As if the Olympic fire itself were a flaming baton that moves from the archer to the swimmer, from the swimmer to the gymnastic and from the gymnast to the triathlonist.
You cannot open a TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in line at the café without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad Le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first time in the Olympic Games, charms with a smile and might well be the name on everyone's lips that would appear and belong to the best viewing and listening time, would be popular with sponsors and would perform in TV ads of good minds if he were just a swimmer, gymnastic or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28 from the California Lake Forest, competes for Olympic gold on a trampoline.
The Olympic Fire does not provide an equal light for all competitions.
Farther from the center, partly in the shade are the less famous sports such as air gun shooting, archery, badminton and taekwondo.
We'll always have a breast swim, and may the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if you allow me to write a modest story about my own special favorite, I would like to draw attention to the temperamental attraction of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since the 2000 Sydney Games, its visibility over the last 16 years has been so low that many of the people I interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic sport.
Ignorance can be regional.
The United States has participated in the Olympic Trampoliin, but the country has never entered the medals and has never progressed to the finals until 2012.
In the men's trampoline, medals seem to go to the Chinese and Russians, and the women's side of the medal has been grabbed by Canadians.
China's Dong Dong and Canada's Rosie MacLennan defend the gold medals they won in London this year.
The trampoline, however, has an underdog charm, partly because in an uncivilized ear it sounds more suitable for circus school than for the Olympics.
(I recognize in this connection that I am no expert, just a regular fan.)
The sport has its comical potential, which the cartoons have used in the ever-increasing bouncing scenes of characters. But it also has the same dignity as gymnastics and diving, i.e. species that combine essentially in trampoline.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means "pop-board."
Ambitious masters jump with a huge trampoline that flies them to a height of nearly 10 metres. Before landing, jumpers must make a series of acrobatic movements, such as threads, folds and volts.
According to the official Olympic programme, jumps are judged by performance, severity and "flight time."
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 different countries compete for the championship of trampoline gymnastics, with 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction for Olympic sports is straight ahead.
When seeking gold, medal hopes must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes over the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
In addition to the goal line or the starting wall, they also have another goal they are aiming for in televised reports, namely a world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is sublime, admirable, even fanatical - and even enough to get a viewer to tears.
But I also find this a little exhausting just to watch the games.
This is where the trampoline offers a breather.
The trampoline's heading up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast bounces up unweight like an astronaut, falls down, and flails back up with ease.
Of course, there is also a competition aspect, and it is not easy either, but it does not involve an intense rush to the finish line or jumping far, just a dreamy and smooth combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to Zen as only the Olympics can get.
Women's qualifying matches and finals will take place on Friday afternoon and start at 1 p.m. local time and men's matches on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will send the finals as part of their afternoon broadcast, starting at 2 p.m. local time on both days.
In the midst of Olympic Mania brings a calm and wonderful moment, which in the midst of the general cravings might be overlooked.
And if awareness can only be increased by offering male athletes to be watched and by objectifying them - as American male gymnastics, according to the Wall Street Journal, recently suggested - then Logan Dooley is only waiting for his breathtaking new fan force.
An entire generation protests in Ethiopia, a long-standing ally of the United States
Violent demonstrations in Ethiopia
Government forces have violently dissolved demonstrations that call for political change across Ethiopia.
According to eyewitnesses, several protesters have been shot to death in confrontation with the police.
Ethiopia is falling apart?
For the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries and a reliable ally of the West, whose economy has grown rapidly.
In recent months, however, the country has been shaken by anti-government demonstrations which are spreading to increasingly large areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed into the streets demanding a radical political change.
According to human rights organisations, the government's reaction was ruthless.
According to eyewitnesses, policemen shot and killed several unarmed protesters.
Probably the demonstrations at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year show how the security forces are hitting young people with sticks who have been forced to stand up against the wall with their hands.
The leading UN human rights officer is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"Keeping the country united has always been difficult, and it has been all the harder to move forward," says Rashid Abdi, research leader of the international crisis group of the African Sarvi project.
Since Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa, whose stability has been promoted by the Western world.
The United States army and intelligence service are closely supporting Ethiopian action against terrorist threats throughout the region, especially Somalia, with only a few African countries, if any, getting this much help from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has been radically improved, the capital city of Addis Ababa is even a new urban cottage.
The streets of cities are usually peaceful, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still a long way from the model country of democracy: human rights organisations have constantly reported on government repressive policies, the opposition in the country is very limited and dissidents are quickly silenced.
Many people have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the wilderness.
But things may be changing.
"If the people are suppressed and have no choice but to show their minds, it will erupt," says Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
"All the young people are showing their minds.
An entire generation protested."
There are many issues of dissatisfaction, ranging from land use to government coalition strangulation of power.
After the widely criticised elections last year, the ruling party and its allies were given the last place previously belonging to the opposition, and as a result they are now ruling the whole Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are growing at the Eritrean border, where the escalating situation in the June battle called for hundreds of deaths.
Analysts fear that in recent years more or less defeated separatist groups, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden People's Liberation Front, may seek to exploit chaos and rearm themselves.
There are many reasons why the embittered mood of years beneath the surface erupts right now.
The first is obviously innocent: smartphones.
Only in the last couple of years have Ethiopians been able to communicate on social media, as cheaper smartphones became common and internet availability improved.
However, even when the government repeatedly prevents access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many access the Internet through proxy servers that conceal their whereabouts.
Many Ethiopian youths reported that this was how they invited people to protests.
Another reason is the increase in solidarity between the two largest groups of the Ethiopian population, the oromos and the amharos.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.
For a long time, Amhars, mainly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, have dominated the country's politics and business and have exploited oromas, many of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But this too is changing.
"The cooperation is deepening and we are getting under the same umbrella," says Mulatu Gemechu, Oromo Director.
The biggest demonstrations have taken place in the Oromo and Amhara regions.
Many amharas and oromos feel that Ethiopia is unjustly dominated by a tribe of tigre, which represents only about 6% of the population and yet dominates the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason behind the unrest is the death of Meles Zenaw.
Former rebel leader Meles was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unnamed disease in 2012.
They thought he was a tactical genius who could see around the corner.
According to analysts, he was particularly skilled at detecting the first signs of discontent and using ambassadors who compromised the relations between the opposing parties.
"The present government lacks this essential instinct," says conflict researcher Abdi.
The new Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn stepped into Meles' boots almost without knowledge.
Unlike Meles, from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
According to analysts, he does not have the confidence of the security forces managed by the Tigre tribe.
Many fear that this will mean more bloodshed.
For the first time in Ethiopia, similar riots occurred in 2005, when thousands protested against the elections, which, according to analysts, were first fucked up by the government and then stole.
In post-election unrest, many protesters were killed, although there were fewer deaths than in the previous months, and the unrest ceased relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for their far-sighted infrastructure planning, such as the new urban area, and for significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But an inner resentment toward the Ethiopian government has clearly not prevented it from getting stronger.
And the grudge is about to take a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, in Gondar, the amhara city, protesters attacked companies owned by tigres, and the anti-tigre hate speech is becoming more widespread in social media.
According to analysts, protests put the United States and other Western allies in a difficult situation.
The US Government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned aircraft monitoring Somalia's neighbouring country, but according to the United States, the base has recently been closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally already in an unstable region to collapse.
"This requires strict balancing," says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of Isis.
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to pull back his words in the latest dispute over his campaign by claiming that he was not serious when he said several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of terrorist group Isis.
The clarification raised new questions for the Republican side about the ability of the candidate to communicate clearly to the citizens of his country.
His supporters will also find themselves in an awkward situation, who will have to try to justify their candidate at these stormy moments and explain comments that he may not have intended.
Trump made the argument at the election ceremony on Wednesday evening and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed that the President and Hillary Clinton created Isis.
However, early Friday morning Trump tweeted and said that his claim was sarcasm.
In Tweet, Trump completely turned his speech from the day before when he said that in several interviews he was quite serious about his accusations.
When the radio host and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by saying that Obamahan was trying to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate refused to back down.
The latest review storm rose as Trump tried to focus his campaign back on the economy as the support figures fell.
Trump and Clinton gave their economic policy lines in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to come back to the subject again.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes and found Clinton's speech boring.
Trump has defended himself with sarcasm before.
At the end of July he received extensive criticism when he seemed to urge the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's e-mail. Later he explained his comments by saying: "Of course I was sarcastic."
In this way, Trump stretches the boundaries of political speech and withdraws his words if necessary.
"I believe that it is his way of testing certain messages that respond to his supporters. He sees how the supporters react to the messages and "explains" in one way or another depending on the reactions," says communications expert Ruth Sherman, who has observed the language used by both candidates for president.
"But I also believe that he understands his claims and knows that they are circumcised enough to pass through different sieves."
Instead of softening his statements to the electoral audience, Trump has in recent days even made his style more stingy as his support figures have continued to decline.
A new poll by NBC, Wall Street Journal and Marist, published on Friday, reported that Trump's support is significantly lower than Clinton's in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, while the situation in Florida is very even.
While Trump usually tries to avoid apologizing for his provocative speeches, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words or for not understanding his sense of humor.
But after ever closer scrutiny over the last few months of his presidential campaign, the Trump jokes have put his loyal supporters in an awkward position where they will have to publicly defend Trump's comments no matter how provocative they may be.
One of Trump's main supporters, former mayor of New York, Rudolph W. Giuliani, strongly defended the presidential candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I consider what he said to be a well-founded, political speech," said Giuliani when asked whether Trump was truthful in claiming that Obama and Hillary Clinton had founded Isis.
"It's true in the sense that before Obama, Isis was almost unknown, a small organization that Obama called completely mistakenly "the lower-series team" and that's why it happened because he pulled troops out of Iraq."
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama regime, where Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to continue its efforts when it failed to deal with the situation decisively in the Middle East.
Before the elections on Friday in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media in Twitter, where he accused them of relentless speech and discriminatory attitude towards him.
He mocked "bad and pathetic" TV commentators who are trying to find out about him, but he says that they cannot succeed.
Some democrats mocked Trump's explanation, and they just said it would show even more clearly that he was not fit to be president.
A coffee shop that has quit due to an excessive rent increase opens at Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a bit of a messy café in Williamsburg, where only cash became a means of payment and there was no Wi-Fi, but which offered good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the café was priced out of its corner of the street on Bedford Avenue when the rent became excessive.
Soap Cherie, who replaced Verb Café in the summer of 2014, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
The locals consider this to be a pity for the loss of a coffee shop that has been lost under the middle class.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe there's no more CBGB Club, Chelsea Hotel has been destroyed and Verb is now a soap shop."
But even though New York is no longer the same, new ones will also be created there.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new cafe in Greenpoint, just a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb café has Wi-Fi and you can pay by credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still unpretentious.
Coffee's still good too.
The owner and manager of the new Verb café is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old café.
He started in Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When one customer offered to fund the opening of a new café, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things the same.
Verb orders bagels from the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso machine model.
In addition, it reactivated even the old Verb lamps.
Mr Rodriguez says that he wanted to try something new, too.
added new products to the list.
There are bacon-egg-cheese sandwiches available and capers and browned onion rings for filling.
There are also dark rice bowls on the list.
No more beer from the cafeteria, but instead fresh fruit juices.
After nine months at the café, Rodriguez says that he noticed that old regular customers began to visit the Verb as a steady stream.
"Also many of our old customers were priced out of Williamsburg," he says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who recently visited the café on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, formerly lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
After moving to Greenpoint, he took walks to the Verb in Williamsburg.
When Verb was shut down, he tells me he's stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized I liked Verb's coffee and culture," he says.
Now he drinks coffee again, even though on that Sunday he took a chai tea mix instead of his usual iced coffee, which is also a new feature.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, visited Verb faithfully since 2003.
He always went to the café before work, and he ordered the same thing without exception.
"I walked into a café every day more than 15 minutes, like a machine, and there they already made my voibagel with all the fillings," he says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to his menu.
Today, Rosenthal still orders his standard product, but occasionally he varies the bacon, egg and cheese fillings of his bagel.
Rodriguez says he doesn't hold a grudge against the fact that the soap shop took the old place.
The owners of Soap Cherie even offered to prepare a special soap, which is made with Verb's own cold - brewed coffee.
"We may still take the offer," Rodriguez says.
Polish people who have traditionally lived in Greenpoint have also welcomed the café with joy.
One of the new customers translated the menu in Polish, and Rodriguez now tells us that he is applying for a suitable place to welcome his new neighbors.
The new place has brought other benefits.
The local juice company wants to bottle and sell cold brewed coffee in the cafeteria.
The café may also expand to the next building.
For many customers, however, it is enough for them to get their own old favourites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular in Williamsburg, and he tells me his heart broke when the café was closed.
When the new place was opened and I ordered coffee there, it was like coming home," says Whitt.
"I missed the smell of the cafeteria."
Difficult food of the Great Depression in the new book: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat for lunch in his office in the White House.
President Roosevelt, known as the culinary, was fond of the luxurious dishes of the Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as the goose liver pâté and Maryland turtle soup.
That day his menu was more modest - devil's eggs (devil's eggs) in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and for dessert plum pudding.
"It was a sign of culinary solidarity with people who suffered," says Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, adds: "It was also a message to the Americans about how they should eat."
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights both work as a food historian.
Coe's latest book, called Chop Suey, tells about a Chinese kitchen in America, while Ziegelman's last book, called 97 Orchard, tells the story of a flat in the Lower East Side district through food.
Their new joint work is A Square Meal, published by Harper and published on Tuesday, which describes the history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity when they agreed to meet with the journalist Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron skyscraper and opened in the same year as the major stock market crash, 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and olive-filled sandwich, and 57-year-old Coe ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When a journalist ordered a meat loaf, the couple said it was appropriate for a discussion about eating a very large depression.
"The mugs were very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
"People ate peanut, liverloaf and papumure.
They were made of substances that were cheap and plentiful.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they are enough for the whole meal."
Andrew Coe is making a big deal out of me.
"It must have weighed like lead in the stomach," he says.
Before the great depression years the American dining table especially in rural areas worked on the buffet principle "eat as much as you want."
Women made food for farm workers, and breakfast, lunch, and dinner served freshly fried pies.
It was the Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal is the chronicle of how the people survived when the abundance suddenly had to be abandoned.
"This was the time when food became a central and distressing subject for Americans," says Coe, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new cheap diet: According to Ziegerman, mysterious dishes such as cereal and spades became the main food, and pot foods were called "a great way to use the food', since cooks could cover not so attractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
The meat, which had been the central part of the American meal for years, became a sparing luxury.
Strange mixtures were tried, where the most important thing was the fulfillment of calorie and nutritional values and not so much the taste or even the common sense of the kitchen.
While doing research for a book, which also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared baked onions filled with peanut butter for a short period of time.
"It didn't get popular at the dinner table," says Coe, where
Ziegelman adds: "It was unreal.
Peanut butter and onion do not mix at all.
This was characteristic of many household recipes'.
Domestic experts, such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Home Agency in 1923-1943, directed the eating habits of citizens in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines and encouraged women to be precise budget managers and to meet the challenge of making delicious foods such as carrot-cream Paget.
The A Square Meal is a celebration of historical flavors.
Especially tasty are the reports of government reactions to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat cake" attitude.
While publicly praising his childhood's simple food on an Iowa farm, he himself ate, like a millionaire and a sophisticated master he had become.
"He liked continental European cuisine, like fish and cucumber sauce," says Coe.
"He ate almost in a gold-covered dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was completely alienated from reality."
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example on his stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in taste at all, the food served at the White House was not only one of Washington's most boring, but also the worst prepared."
Many of the foods in the Depression were abandoned as soon as the earth got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of tradition is still reflected in how we pay attention to calories and food intake and how science has been applied to cooking.
When writing the book, the couple tells that they began to understand Ziegelman's mother's eating habits better, such as why she could not throw away food.
"He was really scared of having to throw away food," say Coe.
"People even began to feel sick about his food," recalls Ziegelman.
"For example, once for wind hats."
After the main dish had been emptied at Eisenberg's lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe brought up their home - made plum dessert, the same one that President Roosevelt ate at his lunch.
"It's called plum foam," says Ziegelman and adds that giving an impressive name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no cream, only plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We reluctantly immersed our spoons in a thick brown goo.
Suddenly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe did the second time and the third time.
"German nuts would make this better," Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budget manager.
Full compensation for legal fees for a patent dispute with Merck for hepatitis C medicine
The judge of the U.S. Regional Court ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to full compensation for legal fees resulting from a dispute with the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co. Inc. on the patent for hepatitis C.
In June, Gilead was released from damages of $200 million for the violation of two patents owned by Merck in connection with successful medicines called Gilead Sovaldi and Harvoni. The U.S. judge found that Merck committed violations involving perjury and other unethical practices.
In an action registered on Thursday, the U.S. Regional Court judge Beth Labson Freeman states that Gilead was entitled to exemption from the legal fees it incurred in defending the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which controls the market with a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can treat more than 90% of patients with hepatitis C.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and demanded the private ownership of sofosbuvir under laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is the active substance of Gilead medicines.
U.S.-supported troops have taken Manbij city from Isis
The troops supported by the United States have taken over the city of Manjib, near the Turkish border in northern Syria, when the last extremist fighters of Isis left the city, says the spokesman for the troops.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) group is now raking the city to find the last Isis fighters hidden in the city.
A representative of the Manbij Military Council of the SDF, Sharfan Darwish, told Reuters that the 2,000 hostages kidnapped by ISIS fighters have been released.
"We are now in full control of the city, but we are still conducting search operations," said Darwish.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent federal tax
On Friday, the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced his 2015 tax return showing that his and his husband's income was $10.75 million at the time and their actual federal tax rate was 34.2.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charitable organizations, mostly the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speech fees, and Hillary Clinton, formerly Secretary of State, announced that he had earned $3 million from Simon & Schuster's publishing house for his book on his term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's vice-president, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton, released ten-year tax returns.
The real federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to show economic transparency," says Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in a press release.
The complete opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and withdraws his promises to publish his tax returns.
According to the custom, US presidential candidates have always made their tax returns public, although the law does not require them to do so.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyer have appealed to the tax administration for an audit and call it the reason that Trump has not disclosed his income information.
"The transfer is yours" tweeted Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams, referring to the tax records of the Democratic candidate.
On Thursday, Trump's Special Counsel Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to disclose his tax information until the inspections were completed.
The critics of Trump, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said that his refusal to disclose information raises questions about Trump's equity, his grants to charity, his business relations and many other ties, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has taken up this question and published a video on Friday in which he brings out prominent Republicans who force Trump to publish his tax information.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the issue in his economic speech in Michigan.
"Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has been doing for decades, and not his public tax returns," said Clinton to the crowd.
According to the Politico online magazine, Trump paid no or little taxes for two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist quoted several tax lawyers and auditors on Friday that the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a key issue for the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a provision named after the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that those earning over $1 million a year would pay at least 30% tax.
President Barack Obama also supports this proposal.
Last week at the Clinton election in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose head office is located in the same location as the Berkshire Hathaway, challenged Trump to a meeting where they would both disclose their tax information.
Buffet says that he too has been subject to an audit by the tax administration and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authority, but of the voters.
The Clinton campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in the city of Chappaqua, New York State, paid on average 32% of the federal tax between 2007 and 2014, and the actual combined tax rate they paid was around 40.5%.
The Clinton tax return for 2015 shows that unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was paid.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund and the Clintons reported an amount of $109,000 in dividends and interest.

Chili powder-filled firecracker condoms to support elephant protection in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania have found an unusual way to keep the elephants away from the human habitation - the elephants are rushed towards them by throwing chili powder-filled condoms.
The method has proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, has, together with the American Nature Conservancy, launched a campaign to teach volunteers in the villages of North Tanzania how to protect their homes and crops without harming elephants.
Not long ago, spears were used to chase elephants.
Friday is the world's elephant day dedicated to animal protection.
"After developing the method, we have seen that attitudes have changed in these villages, for now the villagers can be confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them," says Damian Bell, Executive Director of the Honeyguide Foundation.
First, the intrusive elephant is alarmed by pointing the flashlight and playing the horn.
If this doesn't work, throw the so-called chili cloud.
The mixed chili powder is placed in a condom together with a firecracker, and then the end of the condom is twisted so that only the fuse is left outside.
When the fuse is lit, the condom explodes and spreads a fine chilli powder cloud into the air.
Usually one cloud of spices is enough to drive an elephant away.
The last way to do this is to shoot a firecracker known as a Roman candle into the air and cause a loud and clear explosion.
Jewish film director criticized the Berlin hotel for removing Israel's area code from the Arab "call" - RT News
The French Jewish film director gave birth to a media rage after revealing that the Berlin Kempinski Bristol Hotel does not mention Israel's area code in its country code list. The hotel employee appealed to the "calls" from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Shoah document on Holocaust, expressed his frustration at the Berlin Hotel Kempinski Bristol by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
During his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the list of area codes offered by the hotel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries where you can call directly from the room.
"How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been completely destroyed - as if it did not exist?"
Lanzmann writes.
On the other hand, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through a separate call center.
The film director asked for an explanation from the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes that the receptionist's reply shocked him.
The receptionist said that the removal of Israel from the list was a "decision carefully considered by the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason behind the procedure further shocked the film director.
According to Lanzmann, the official said: 'Most of our guests are Arabs and they are calling for the Israeli area code to be deleted'.
Mr Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, Israeli Ambassador to Germany, interviewed by the Suddeutsche Zeitung, said that the incident was a "great disgrace."
"The incident shockes and shockes us all.
It's a great shame.
And the more shameful it is, given that we are in Germany and it is precisely this hotel chain.
That's all the explanations we need.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," says Ambassador.
The incident caused quite a counter-reaction on the web where it was called scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel simply gave in to alleged demands from Arab customers.
"Shame" was said in a series of publications that highlighted the location of the hotel near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm street.
Der Spiegel writes that the hotel denied the charges quickly, called it a mistake and apologized to Lanzmann.
"The direct order to exclude Israel from the area code list was never given," writes the representative of the Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski Hotel said.
It adds that the area code has since been added to the list.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets to protest Brazilian students
Students met with the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered together to protest against government reforms in the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protestors.
The riot began when law enforcement tried to break up a group of students, resulting in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas by the police.
Hundreds of students took part in the demonstration, who wanted to show their dismay at government plans.
Governor Geraldo Alckmin of Sao Paulo State has proposed a austerity measure, with almost 100 public schools closing down and 300 000 students being placed in new schools.
Some of the protesters made graffiti on walls that were temporarily opposed to Michel Temer, who was in charge of the presidency.
The student demonstration took place only a few days after the streets were filled with protestors in favour of disfellowshiped President Dilma Rousseff, with the Senate voting on the charges against him.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71% - RT Business
Since the removal of sanctions, the annual trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9%, says Russian Ambassador Levan Dzhagaryan.
He said that Russian companies' interest in business in Iran has increased since international sanctions against Iran were lifted.
"Russian companies continue their existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Of course, further growth in trade is one of the priorities of cooperation between countries," says Dzhagaryan.
He notes that during the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period in 2015 and rose to USD 856 million.
"In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5% to 697 million dollars.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to USD 158 million.
Sales of machinery, land vehicles and weapons accelerated the trade," says Ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
"Last year the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued approximately 35 000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of which were travel visas.
In addition, for the first time, Iran was among the first 20 countries to travel to Russia.
And it is not too daring to say that the record number of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year," he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend traveling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi, who have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he says.
Scots Callum Skinner raced to the finish line when the British won the bike gold.
Scotland's Callum Skinner became a champion at the Rio Velodrom last night when the British Trio defended the championship that was earned in London in 2012.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow was an anchor who inherited from his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy. The young man made the legend proud in thanking the goal and winning the victory from the New Zealand team, which was considered to be the favorite.
Britain took a surprise victory four years ago when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic golds.
And they repeated the stunt after they finished only six months at the World Racing Championships held in London in March, despite Hoy having since left his career.
The problem between Beijing and London was replacing Jamie Staff, who specialized in the role of the first leader.
Hindes came out just in time.
Hoy's decision to end the race also left a gap that Kian Emad and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner, from Scotland, was a man whom British coaches believed in and where they saw the potential that he has now redeemed.
Hindes, with Hoy the winner of the championship four years ago, Kenny and Skinner made an Olympic record in the time run, but in the first round, New Zealand was faster.
And the three of Britain won gold in a duel.
Hindes was close behind after his tour, but Kenny struggled to lead the team that Skinner maintained.
Much of the change was to change the strategy so that Hindes drove to slow down the pace with a higher gear, which enabled Kenny and Skinner in particular to keep the pace.
Hoy followed his post as a BBC commentator and reached Skinner, Kenny and Hindes' eyes as they stepped on the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner of Glasgow says, "I'm flattered by the comparison.
I'm just trying to do my best and succeed.
We made an Olympic record in the finals and won the world champions.
It was incredible.
There is no better way to win it."
After winning in London in 2012, Hindes, along with Kenny and Hoy, admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track because of a bad departure.
Later he withdrew his words, and Britain's rivals had no means of appeal.
This time there were no problems of this kind associated with sovereign victory.
Hindes says, "The feeling was as it was in London, all the British flags were flying in the audience.
Our team became united over the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships that the victory at the Olympics feels great."
In other words, one contest, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of ten railway championships in Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of progress over the last five months, then five days of velodrom will be a success.
As Kenny has demonstrated with his abilities, it is not impossible to imagine that he will repeat Hoy's achievements and win three Olympic gold in one Olympic Games.
This would mean gaining an account with six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoyt and was also born on 23 March (the magical date of British sport, which is also Steve Redgrave's, Mo Farah's and Roger Bannister's birthday).
The medal results would be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny's gonna compete next in a sprint that starts today and is gonna be solved in three days.
Kenny, 28 years old from Bolton, says: "At this moment I can only rejoice in this.
The team race is always the best.
You're gonna enjoy the victory together with the guys.
Winning alone is a little lonely."
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he'll have to get a knight's rank."
This was the only medal contest today, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doll were the fastest four-man team-run.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The world record that was made in London in 2012 and which won gold is 3:51.659.
The first round and finals (at 22.42 p.m.) will be held today on the second day of the competition, and the focus of attention will certainly be Wiggins.
Yesterday, he had a dispute with the competition agents before the time run when they invited him to measure his length.
In a similar women's competition that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavie reached world record time 4:13.260.
The British team can now be confident that its great racing team will take over the middle stage of the Olympic Games and bring a number of medals to the country.
After the truly exceptional evidence of full leadership in Beijing and London, expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
In the background there have been dramas, the least of which is the resignation of Technical Director Shane Sutton in April, in the face of allegations of sexism and bullying, and the end of great athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, the competitions on the first night at the Velodrom show that the already legendary reputation of Great Britain is once again being realized at the perfect moment.
The future of the Portland Melting Plant at stake as a result of the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the aluminium smelter in the state of Victoria, Portland, and thus the jobs of thousands of workers are at stake when the power company supplying electricity told the plant that one of the plant's owners was dismantling the supply contract and it is expected that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This is the result of Victoria's Government's decision earlier this year not to continue to grant aid to keep the plant in operation.
Fixed aid granted for 20 years will cease in November.
As many as 2,000 jobs are in danger of disappearing from the Alcoa Portland plant.
As a result of closures, up to 2,000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk.
The snowball effect may continue to increase, as the melting plant consumes about 10% of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's smelting plant, which resulted in the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoa Portland smelting plant is losing money and is in danger of having to close its doors.
The measures are similar to speculations about the future of the plant that have been going on for years, first caused by the strong Australian dollar and, recently, the price of its production.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminium smelter from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says that it is expected that the other three owners of the melting plant will also terminate their contract.
The majority owner of the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina. Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own minority interests in the factory.
AGL says that it expects the Portland plant to remain operational, which means that the physical demand for electricity from the melting plant will continue.
AGL reports that the contracts are so-called hedging agreements that were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The contract notice period is 12 months and will expire in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL expects the contracts to generate revenue in 2017," says the power plant.
The potential return effects for AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by strong future market prospects for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL says that it has already reduced the value of contracts by $187 million in its accounts as a "pre-emption" to terminate contracts.
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to keep the smelting plant in operation or to secure the supply of electricity to the smelting plant'.
The American company stated that it had concluded a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to enter into force from November this year, although it still needs to find out why it has now withdrawn from the agreement.
Due to the weak financial situation of the sector, analysts have been cautious about their estimates of both the melting plant in the state of Victoria in Portland and the factory in Tomago near Newcastle.
The operational director of the AGL, Stephen Mikkelsen, told the analysts in his speech earlier this week that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago about 900 megawatts per year.
"If these plants leave the market, it will mean a significant decrease in demand (electricity) on the market.
As a producer for us, that would not be good news," says Mikkelsen.
Kardashianit-true TV star Kendall as the cover girl of September Vogue
The Kardashian-Jenner Clan model and the fourth daughter of her mother and manager Kris, Kendall Jenner, 20, poses in the famous September issue of Vogue in the United States.
Kendall, who is the ad face of Estee Lauder and performed in the Fashion Weeks of Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news in his Instagram account on Thursday.
"Looking at a man in a room full of my loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The release of the cover was followed by a strange (or perhaps only Kardashianist?), a scripted video showing all the members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (bar jammers Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favorite uncle, Kardashianit producer Ryan Seacrest) presenting their sister's cover photo. The video ends in a classic turn: they were all planning a surprise party for their sister.
The plot is cliché, and it is used in almost all the birthday periods of the stage programs (Seacrest says, "Did you think we'd forgotten you?" as sincerely as the cartoon character of the children's morning TV), but Kris had to get his other daughters involved in this publicity somehow.
For the performance in the September issue of Vogue is undoubtedly a new Kardashian era.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have gotten to Vogue's lawsuit before (she appeared on Vogue's cover together with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is in its very own category.
The September issue is Vogue's best-selling release every year.
The number that resembles the fashion magazine attracts a large number of advertisers (the fashion site Fashion calculated that there were 615 pages of ads in the 832-page opus last year).
The release of the cover star in September is so eagerly expected that in the last two years the pictures of the magazine have been leaked even before the official announcement.
Previously, the cover models have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years there have been celebrities working on the cover rather than models that are celebrities.
The Oscar winner and Dior commercial face Jennifer Lawrence was in the cover photo in 2013, and a year later Lady Gaga was honored.
The magazine describes Jenner as a model of success for his generation, and even if he prefers to be among the celebrities who work as a model, he is in quite good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of well-known people, reality TV stars or children of today who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all about these).
You can rightly call them talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry over others.
Beyonce, who appeared in the cover photo last year, has one of the strongest years of his career when he published his Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Because of her reality TV background, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, the original model of Victoria's Secret, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague, Gigi Hadid, by calling them "bitches."
These emotions have resurfaced as news of Jenner's appearance on Vogue's cover came out.
However, the constant lingering of discontent seems irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is a cover model for the September issue of Vogue.
He's a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
He's walking at Marc Jacobs' fashion shows.
She's the ad face of Estee Lauder makeup creams.
He and all his sisters sell pictures of themselves through paid apps.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter that she was shooting for Love magazine.
And in his spare time, he plays on reality TV, maybe just as a way to meet his sister and her children.
Legal aid centres turn 160 000 people away a year
More than 160 000 people in the most vulnerable countries are turned away from legal aid centres each year and the sector is preparing for the effects that additional cuts in appropriations will already have on centres operating at the extremes.
In the state of Queensland, three out of five people seeking free legal aid and legal aid are already turned away - most of them elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unjustified evictions and similar injustices without resources.
Public legal aid services, whose workload is already overloaded, are preparing for further cuts in appropriations.
Since June next year, the legal aid centres are in danger of losing another 30% of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Public Legal Aid Centre, reports that according to the latest calculation report prepared by the National Association of Legal Aid Centres, thousands of people are already being turned away each year.
If the federal government doesn't turn a blind eye to its decision, Farrell says it's gonna get worse.
"Queensland's public legal aid centres are constantly underfunded, which means thousands of people are turned away when they apply for the necessary services," says Farrell.
"People from violent relationships, people under an uncontrolled and crippling debt burden, families leaving, workers made redundant - all of them have legal problems, and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The federal government plans to cut funding by 30% from June 2017, which means that thousands of the most vulnerable in Queensland will have to deal with complex legal problems without help.
We appeal to the Chancellor of Justice and Queensland Senator George Brandis to give up these financial cuts immediately so that people can have the legal aid they need.
Last year, the state administration fulfilled its promise to bring legal aid funding to the national average.
It is now time to take into account the needs of public legal aid centres and their clients, and the Government of Palaszczuk must invest in this important work."
Donald Trump's campaign was filed with a gunfighter.
New York: An action was brought against the campaign by Donald Trump when no action was supposedly taken after its leadership had been informed that the leader of the campaign in North Carolina had threatened the employee with a gun while they were driving in Jeep in February.
The event is described in an action brought by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer for the state campaign, on Wednesday at the state court in Charlotte.
Mr Bordini says that he had waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally before he realized, according to his own words, that this would not happen.
In his lawsuit, Bordini says that campaign leader Earl Phillip "put out his pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger and pressed the pipe into Vincent's kneecap."
Following a complaint to the local and regional management of the campaign, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experienced the same thing with Phillip.
"Even if a gun isn't fired, it's causing damage," says Bordini in his lawsuit.
The action comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused a general rage when he said to the crowd in North Carolina that "the supporters of the second additional section" - considered to be gun owners and gunmen - could take action if his opponent Hillary Clinton wins the election and gets to choose judges.
According to Trump's campaign staff, the media took his words out of context and his words did not encourage violence.
In his suit, Mr Bordini claims compensation from the campaign for indifference and Phillip for assault, assault and emotional suffering.
Trump's spokesman, Hope Hicks, did not immediately respond to the message asking for a comment.
Despite attempts, Phillip could not be reached.
Charlotte's local news agency, WCCB, told me that Phillip recently left the campaign.
Phillip's consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, did not receive an immediate response to the call.
The Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump, has been engaged in a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must use the Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also revives the economy and creates well-being - not only in local communities and London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the point that was most interested in Heathrow. As in the 2012 Olympic Games in London, we invested immensely in the benefit of our nation as a whole and of all our regions.
The Olympic Games brought enormous benefits to Stratford and East End.
We will do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses close to Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships and 40 000 new jobs, which will eliminate youth unemployment in the vicinity of the airport.
As in the 2012 Olympic Games in London, there are always people who feel that the extension of Heathrow is too great a challenge.
As far as the Olympic Games are concerned, I was told that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will find ourselves in an awkward situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will also be wrong about Heathrow.
Obstacles to be overcome will always be met, but Heathrow will answer every question asked.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits many rather than a few.
This expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and to increase the economy by £ 211 billion, bringing knowledge and employment both to the airport environment and to the United Kingdom as a whole.
We have a great task force at Heathrow, which has carried out on time and by keeping to the budget an infrastructure investment programme of GBP 11 billion, including the T5 terminal - which has been voted the best flight terminal of the year for two consecutive years - and the T2 terminal, which was built in the middle of two of the world's most crowded runways.
Now they are ready to produce a third runway supported by a private investment of GBP 16 billion.
The 2012 London Olympic Games were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be the extension of Heathrow.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic spirit to extend Heathrow so that we can guarantee the future of our trade and create the skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the Chairman of Heathrow's Board of Directors and a former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook advertising prevention in a cat-mouse game
Attempts by companies that earn money from online advertising to mislead advertising software have turned into a cat-mouse game, says one of the companies that produce blocking software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook had announced that it would block advertising software, Adblock Plus published a blog article where it told users can update their blocking software filters and thus again block community service ads.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would change the advertising codes on its desktop site so that it would be more difficult to identify which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says he's got the new codes.
Adblock's spokesman Ben Williams wrote in his blog that "this kind of balling between the open source advertising community and the diversions has been going on ever since advertising prevention was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon make its own repair move again.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of the great concern that advertisers have become in the sector.
Globally, an estimated 200 million people use advertising prevention programmes, reports a study carried out by Pagefair and Adobe last year. The figure has increased almost fourfold since 2013.
Facebook is used daily by 1.03 million active users on mobile devices, and mobile advertising already accounts for 84% of Facebook advertising revenue.
However, the company intends to invest in deception of advertising prevention programs in its desktop application, as according to the publicist, mobile advertising prevention programs do not work on Facebook's mobile applications and Instagram.
The revenue from Desktop ads is still high enough, which is why Facebook considered the investment worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook also announced that it would update the ad tool for user settings so that users can better control how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticized Adblock's new filters as they also prevent some of the usual Facebook posts from appearing.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to solve the problem," said Facebook's publicist in his email release.
"The ad-blocking programmes are clumsy and inefficient, and that is why we have instead invested in developing user settings such as advertising tools so that people can control the targeting of advertising themselves."
A woman committed suicide by dropping herself under a car on a Swiss highway.
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are asking for the help of eyewitnesses on the highway during the first hours of Thursday, when a woman deliberately fell victim to more than one car.
The accident took place on the A1 motorway in the canton of Vaud near Morges shortly after midnight.
She did her desperate act by lying down in the dark road and was hit by several cars, says the Vaud police in a press release.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman with a clear intention of committing suicide. Among the overtime cars was also a truck.
She died at the scene.
According to the police, many drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some are still unidentified, and the police are asking them or other witnesses to report.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter reports in Le Tribune de Geneva that a criminal investigation has been launched, which is a logical step in this kind of situation.
However, it remains to be seen whether the drivers involved in the accident will be prosecuted.
"Was it impossible to avoid a collision?
That remains for the prosecution to find out," says Hofstetter.
In the last five years, two similar cases have occurred which exclude drivers from responsibility.
According to the newspaper, in both cases a person walked on the dark highway and the court ruled that drivers cannot expect to run into a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, the police officer was released from charges against him of death after his encounter with a man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on one night of August 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim had consumed plenty of alcohol and passed out on the road.
The Court held that the way the police - who were responding to the distress call - was justified and that the man lying on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation."
Anyone who knows about the accident near Morges on Thursday will be asked to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus has been viable
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus may have been viable.
NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model to explore Venus' past with the same tools and algorithms as climate scientists use.
The model was designed to determine whether conditions on Venus could have been similar to those on earth, even though Venus is hot and anhydrous on the surface and its atmosphere consists almost entirely of carbon dioxide.
According to previous researchers, Venus' slow rotational speed is explained by its thick atmosphere.
However, the latest simulation suggests that Venus has had a thin atmosphere corresponding to the earth and has nevertheless been spinning slowly.
The model was also used to determine the early surface formation of Venus.
There were probably more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographical variation to sustain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent dim.
"In the modeling of the GISS Venus rotates slowly and its daylight is almost two months at a time," says GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick cloud layer. The cloud layer acts like an umbrella and protects the surface to a large extent from the heat of the sun.
As a result, the average climate temperatures are even a few degrees lower than the current Earth temperatures.
The model was used to create Venus's story, which corresponds to the planetary scientists' previous assumptions about its evolution.
Although Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated, and ultraviolet light burned vaporized water.
When hydrogen karate, all that was left in space was a thick carbon - bearing atmosphere and a deadly greenhouse effect - that is, Venus as it is today.
Researchers reported the results of the new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is giving up his position as coach of Avalanche.
On Thursday Patrick Roy resigned from his duties as coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and as vice-president of the club's hockey operations, citing a lack of influence in the team's decision-making.
Colorado's Vice President/Director General Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the club would immediately start applying for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have performed my duties as head coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and as vice-president of the club's hockey business with enthusiasm, passion and determination," says 50-year-old Roy in his communication.
"I've been thinking long and hard about how to improve the team, give it the depth needed and raise it to a higher level during the summer.
In order to achieve this, the vice-president of coach and club hockey activities must be in complete agreement with the organisation.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are currently not met."
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his investment in the team.
"Patrick told me his decision today," says Sakic.
"We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him all the best for the future."
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach in the league for his first season as head coach of Avalanche from 2013 to 2014.
Under his leadership, the club reached 112 points and won the middle division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoffs and has not reached the extension period in the last two years.
Avalanche reached 39-39-4 power points in 2015-2016 and remained five points away from Minnesota Wild while playing for another Wild Card position at the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goalie Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career - two in the Montreal Canadiens and two in the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers start negotiations and suspend the strike
The main negotiators say that wage strikes for North Sea oil workers will be interrupted when all parties to the dispute participate in a new round of negotiations.
The Wood Group, which provides oilfield services, has been struck by drilling platforms in the North Sea under the control of Royal Dutch Shell.
According to the Joint Declaration of the Parties, "Wood Group and trade unions United States and RMT confirm that they have agreed to reopen the process in order to resolve the dispute."
From the beginning of next week, we will be holding several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will be dealing with the problems of recent aspects.
The trade unions justified their recent activity, which, according to them, was the first in over 25 years, as a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group cuts around 9% of its North Sea contractors' tariffs this year.
The company's tariff reduction follows a 10% reduction in the prices of contractors working in the country in 20114.
According to the company, further cuts will give it the room for manoeuvre necessary to cope with the downturn in the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut thousands of employees off from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, thereby increasing its efficiency after its mega-fusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Lower crude oil prices and the economic situation resulting from the decision taken by Great Britain in June to leave the European Union put pressure on energy companies.
Dave Anderson, a Scottish Member of Parliament, met with the workers' leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest work problems that the North Sea has experienced for a whole generation.
According to him, the North Sea is vital to the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and in the whole country we need an economy that benefits many and not just a few," says Anderson.
In 2016, less than USD 1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea, compared with around USD 7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of the stars in the Pleiades Star Corps.
The latest task of the Kepler Space Telescope has been to measure the rotation rate of the stars, which has helped the astronomers to compile the most comprehensive list of the rotation speeds of the Plejad stars so far.
Based on new data, astronomers are able to determine why stars in the same group of stars rotate at different speeds and how cycles are related to planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing the results with other star groups, we will learn more about the relationship between weight and age and even the history of its solar system," says Luisa Rebull, researcher at Caltech University of Pasadena, infrared processing and analysis center.
The Pleiades are located 445 light years from the earth.
Many of the stars of the group have been born about 125 million years ago, which means that they are about to reach their adult age.
They're spinning faster than ever.
With the speed of rotation at its peak, large amounts of star wind are released from the growing stars.
These winds have a braking effect on the stars as they progress through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star grows older, its speed of rotation begins to slow.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by following the time between recognizable starspots (equivalent to sunspots).
The latest listed speed data suggest that larger stars rotate slower than smaller ones.
Rebull compares the stars to the dancers - larger spins slower than smaller ones.
"We can see from the "dancing" of the Plejades that the slow rotators are typically larger, whereas the fastest spinrs are typically very light stars," says Rebull.
Since the Pleiades are so close, it acts as an ideal space laboratory to compare the properties of the stars with the speed of rotation.
"The Pleiades Star Force provides a pillar for theoretical models dealing with the rotation of both younger and older stars," says Rebull.
We want to learn a lot more about how, when and why the stars slow down their rotation speed and stop "dancing."
Rebull and his colleagues present their latest analysis of Plejades' speed of rotation in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
