Eemeli Kouki led to Hurricane's home victory in the opening - Savo Volley's second victory
As many as seven times in a row, Hurricane Loimaa, who was at the men's volleyball Championship Medal, began the season 2018-19 with a home win when Raisio's Loimu fell on Saturday 3-0.
The overall player Eemeli Kouki, who returned from Romania to Finland, was 22 points of Hurricane's most powerful.
There were some tunes abroad, but they didn't come true, and then a call came from Loimaa.
It was pretty quick to work things out, Kouki said.
Like Koukki, Tom Rumpunen, who played in Loimki, supported Kouki with 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was the national team chipper Samuli Kaislasalo with 17 points.
The win of the opening game is always important.
Many players had experience with the other side, and it brought extra ecstasy to the game.
Our game is not yet complete, but continuing the medal pipe is of course the goal," Kouki said.
Määttänen Savo Volley's most powerful
Miro Määttänen was at 18 points Savo Volley's most powerful when the team knocked out Vantaa Ducks 3-0.
Our game was fluctuating, especially at the head of the attack, but luckily we were able to squeeze the victory.
At least I didn't have any conscious charge when I played against my former team," Määttänen said.
Next to Volleyball in the 3-series period 2000-01, Antti Siltala, who started her career, scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with many things.
The hall was small, the atmosphere in the ceiling all the time.
I got a good feeling about the house opening.
Miro was king, Silki also played a good game," said Tuovinen.
Siltala's previous season in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver at Pielavesi Sammo while Tuovinen was also the head coach.
Thiago Maciel was Ducks' most powerful 14 points.
Mikkonen again Akaa-Volley star
In 2012-13, Joni Mikkonen, who won the league's point exchange, has also started this season strongly.
The hacker scored 25 points when Akaa-Volley took his season opening victory after knocking down Kokkola's Tigers 3-2.
The season has started from its own point of view.
Of course, today was a loss close because we were on the fourth round 17-21.
We dug up a lottery win, and the fifth round came at the same time," Mikkonen said.
A few seasons ago the most powerful of the Tiggers still at the finals was the 28 points scored by the chipper Edwards Builds.
Landman Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs supported by 17 points.
We didn't get much of a grip on the guy's picker, Mikkonen said.
Finland in comparison with human capital world number one
Finland is at the top of the world in comparison with human capital," says Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years Finland was number one in statistics.
In 2016, the top five was almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands followed Finland.
Later, Holland scored one higher and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found on the list.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan ranked worst in comparison.
When measuring human capital, the level of education, access to education, skills and health of the population will be examined.
The World Bank has outlined the link between human capital and economic growth.
Real Madrid Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico in check, the local game ended goalless
Real Madrid goaltender Thibaut Courtois stretched into the splendid fights, and the local game of the Madrid teams ended in a goalless tie late Saturday at the Spanish Football League.
From Atletico Madrid, Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were closest to the goal, but Belgian watchman Courtois was able to get out.
Courtois played at Atletico three seasons on loan when he was a Chelsea player.
At the beginning of the week, the International Football Federation Fifa chose him as goaltender for the year.
At Real, the best goal was Gareth Bale, but his shot went past the end of the first half of the goal.
After the break, Bale was replaced by a femoral injury.
According to ESPN, the disillusioned supporters of Real called out in the match the name of Cristiano Ronaldo of the goal cannon that moved to Juventus.
The United States is now under attack against abortion rights - A powerful document tells us why
The United States Senate is currently trying to determine whether one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could be chosen as the candidate appointed by President Donald Trump, Brett Kavanaugh.
Many in the Republican Party hope that Kavanaugh's decisive vote will overturn the decision known as Roe versus Wade, which made abortion legal in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary film Reversing Roe - The United States and abortion rights tell us how the current situation has become over the years.
Unbelievable as it seems, the topic is also topical in Finland.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (sin) has done publicity work against safe abortion and has received various levels of support from the majority of our country's MPs.
At the beginning of a powerful documentary, gynecologist Colleen McNicholas is to be met, who has become the only doctor in Missouri State who has had abortions because of the extortion of laws.
An armed guard at the clinic tells us he's defending religious freedom in the United States.
News feeds remind us of the deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
Moving on to the time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the association of Lutheran churchmen guided women to reliable abortion doctors.
The arguments of the interviewed pastor are good, but in fact they are not even needed; a photograph of the woman who died of an abortion is sufficient.
There were about 5,000 deaths in the United States a year.
In particular, the Republican Party defended the legalisation of abortions.
As early as 1967 in California, Governor Ronald Reagan signed the Abortion Law.
Later, it was Reagan, in his presidential campaign in 1980, who became a turning point in mixing religion with politics for the electorate.
His abortion strain was also reversed by his successor, George Bush, Senior.
And that's what Donald Trump did.
To the deepest point of the matter, the document reaches the point of finding the basis for the politicisation of abortion.
By denying tax exemption to religious organizations that support racial segregation, they became politically active.
Abortion was chosen as a cane horse.
Religion has brought extraordinary knots to politics.
In writing this, there is a situation in the United States where the president has chosen Kavanaugh, who is now accused by many women of sexual harassment, to be the highest candidate for the Supreme Court.
Kavanaugh may have the power to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls based on the balance of language status.
The Israeli army shot seven Palestinians, including two children - at the border with large demonstrations
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months when Israel has fired on demonstrators in the border zone.
Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza border zone on Friday," says the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, there are two children among the dead: boys aged 12 and 14.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
Of these, 89 were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and made an air strike in the border zone when protesters threw stones and explosives at Israeli troops.
The army says that it has started using force so that protesters do not break down the border fence or try to cross it.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in Gaza demonstrations since March when the Palestinians started weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, 12 000 are wounded.
The protesters called for Palestinian families to be allowed access to the territories from which the Palestinians had to leave when the State of Israel was founded in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
Explosives dropped with kites and helium balloons from the Palestinian side have ignited forest areas and farmland in Israel.
Teemu Santa got a penalty kick - didn't get to shoot himself
Wigan's top chey dunkley seemed to have knocked him over with a tackle in the penalty zone behind him.
The referee Gavin Ward let the game go on.
According to his interpretation, the tackle was clean.
Teemu Santa couldn't believe his eyes.
Looks like the situation remained awkward for referee Ward, who sentenced Norwich to a penalty kick for 85 minutes when Santa was knocked down.
Ward showed me a penalty point, and Mario Vrancic hit the 1-0 win goal.
Santa has scored five goals for Norwich in the Championship.
The last one was born last Saturday against QPR with a stylish chest muscle.
The work tasted like Santa again.
After he lost the ball, he continued to the end of the situation.
He created goals and defended himself tirelessly.
For Norwich, the fight was five in two weeks.
The team will continue in the league cup.
There's a five-win streak in the back.
The pedophile support service was immediately filled with reservations - about 40 000 people in Finland are interested in children
It is estimated that two per cent of men and a small proportion of women experience at least some sexual interest in pamphlets.
In Finland, this means about 40 000 people.
Up until now, those who are sexually interested in children or young people have found it difficult to get help.
The joint SeriE project between the Criminal Service Support Foundation and Sexpo will train professionals to meet paedophiles as customers and help people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, a flood of e-mails and appointments were made very quickly in Sexpo, which provides advice and therapy," Yle says.
However, these are promised to be released during the autumn.
For many, sexual affection for children is a disgrace.
The majority of those who notice pedophile feelings themselves have not carried out their fantasies and thus did nothing criminal.
However, pleasure is usually a permanent quality.
Most of them hope to get rid of thoughts that distress and discourage them.
They also complicate normal life," says Yle, sexual therapist Patricia Thesleff, who works as a specialist in the project.
In my opinion, work is valuable if even one child is spared sexual violence," says Thesleff.
The Korean leaders or the Congolese gynaecologist?
As the winner of President Donald Trump's Nobel Peace Prize, the idea may sound strangely strange, but based on betting odds, Trump is one of the biggest favorites to win the prize.
The background is Trump's role in getting North Korea, at least at the level of speeches, to commit to nuclear disarmament.
The biggest favourites for Nobel Peace are Moon Jae-in, President of South Korea, and Kim Jong-un, Director of North Korea, who have already met three times this year and have promised to seek a peace agreement between their countries.
The warming between the Koreas is significant, as it was still icy last year.
Yet, rewarding Kim, who has been threatened with nuclear weapons for years with an iron grip on her country, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The winners of the Nobel Prizes will be announced from Monday, and on Friday the most prominent prize will be the Peace Prize.
If the prize is not awarded to those involved in Korean diplomacy, Denis Mukwege, a Congolese doctor, is one of the leading candidates.
In his hospital in the DRC, the respected gynecologist has treated thousands of women who have been victims of mass rape and has become the world's leading expert in his field.
Mukwege's work has drawn attention to sexual violence, which is a gruesome byproduct of many conflicts.
The UN Refugee Organisation, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been seen as a strong candidate.
The Nobel Committee has announced that this year there will be 331 candidates for the prize.
The names of the candidates will not be disclosed to the public.
Trump himself wouldn't mind if he got the Nobel Prize.
In May, a journalist asked him at the White House whether he thought he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it myself," Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the world, the President went on to refer to the North Korean negotiations.
But there are things that make Trump's Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides on the prize, has often given recognition to individuals and organisations representing liberal democracy and multipolar world order - precisely the kind of international cooperation that Trump has been seen to be opposed to.
In the 21st century, the prize was awarded to three American politicians, all of whom were democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
So rewarding Trump would require an ideological turning of the Nobel Committee.
Fire report in the tunnel: Motorists behaved like charms and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos on the first road in Lohja took place on September 8th.
The traffic in the tunnel area was cut off as a result of the announcement both towards Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that this was a systemic problem, the fire department tried to bring traffic back to normal.
However, it did not work very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Center said it couldn't be opened because there are drivers on the road shocking and they drive as it happens, the on-call fireman Pasi Kääriäinen told STT that he was fresh at the time.
At that time the highway was even going in the wrong direction only after a moment's waiting.
When the first begins to work against traffic rules, a few others often follow, Tapio Heiskanen, Traffic Safety Contact Manager, is surprised.
According to traffic regulations, there must be no stopping on motorways and tunnels except for imperative reasons.
Traffic safety points out that, in exceptional circumstances, it is not possible to go risking traffic with hasty solutions.
Emergency vehicles shall always be provided with the most accessible access.
Driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is especially prohibited, as is the U-turn and cancellation.
The same bans are also valid in tunnels where headlights must always be switched on.
Stopping without compelling reason is also prohibited, as is, of course, parking.
There have even been cases of a driver stopping in a tunnel to brush the snow out of his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this activity," says Heiskanen in the Traffic Safety Bulletin.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party even though the ship was caught at the bottom of the lake.
The Ilves fans carried by the inland waterway ship M/S Tampere would have liked to stay on board to continue their victory party, even though the ship had been caught in the bottom of the lake, says Juho Syrjä, the ship's leader at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, who travelled from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drifted late on Saturday night off his route and was caught in the bottom of its bow in Vanajavesi, Aka.
Nineteen passengers and five crew members on board were evacuated at night to the mainland.
Nobody got hurt in the haver.
The Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party on the ship until morning, but of course it made more sense to send them on a fire department ride to the port and by bus home," Syrja said to STT.
The Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna watching the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended with the Ilves 4-3 victory.
According to the outpost, Saturday's hay was due to the water's surface in Vanajavesi about half a meter lower than normal.
According to Syrjä, navigation was also hampered by the fact that the nearest fairway sign was covered by log residues, which meant that its reflectors were not normally visible in a dark autumn bridge.
No more significant impact
The Haveri took place on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalmi shortly after the ferry route had hit the bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
According to Syrjä, there was no greater drama in the case, since the speed of the ship was very low at the time of the incident and the impact on the bottom did not cause a more significant collision.
According to the outpost, being caught at the bottom has not caused any leaks or impressions on the ship, and the cruises to the ship continue normally.
On Saturday morning, the diver came to check the ship's condition before it began to be towed off the shallow.
As a precaution, we will go to the shipyard to check that there was no damage, says Syrjä.
Syrjä believes that the next M/S Tampere cruise booked for next weekend can be done as agreed.
According to him, the cruise season of the ship will continue until the Independence Day.
No use for ambulances
The rescue department received an alert on Saturday night shortly after 12:30.
In the port of Viiala, ambulances were alerted to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
Emergency firemaster Matti Willman told me late in the evening that the evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult due to darkness and quite harsh winds.
After half past three, the Pirkanmaa Rescue Department announced on the night against Sunday that all those on board had been evacuated and passengers had been transferred by bus to Tampere.
The cruiser built in 1957 has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
The judge candidate for Trump, accused of harassment and drunkenness, may be out of position at the top of the line.
Brett Kavanaugh, the U.S. Supreme Court judge, may well be missing the post he was seeking, says Programme Director Mika Aaltola of the Institute for Foreign Policy.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate conduct during their studies.
According to Aaltola, suspicions have put so much political pressure on the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up in a position to represent another person.
From time to time, it has occurred in the United States that the President's candidate for a Supreme Court judge has caused a great deal of controversy.
In this case, the candidate for a judge has usually withdrawn himself," says Aaltola.
This has enabled the President to maintain his face.
A name would rain on the Larium of Democrats.
The U.S. Supreme Court seeks to be above politics, but at least in Kavanaugh's case, the election of a new judge has become a very politically sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision will probably rain on the Democratic Party Lar in the forthcoming interparliamentary elections.
That would raise the electoral enthusiasm among young people and women who are more likely to vote for democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
The appointment does not take place for every term of office, since in the United States judges of the Supreme Court are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request at the age of 70 to 80.
The Republicans, too, have some hesitations about the appointment.
The U.S. Supreme Court judges are normally examined," says Aaltola.
Even though Trump has set a deadline of only one week for the FBI's further investigation, Aaltola says that it can bring up something relevant.
Yeah, it might.
There is rarely smoke without fire," says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, at least it is certain that Kavanaugh's suitability or unfitness for office will still be discussed vigorously before the Senate takes its decision.
The Republicans have a majority of 51-49 in the Senate, but at least two female Republican senators are thought to be sceptical about the appointment of Kavanaugh.
The most embarrassing thing would be for the nomination to be put to the vote and for the Republicans to lose.
A woman identified a suspect in Salisbury as an agent.
The Russian woman has informed the BBC that she recognizes Salisbury as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service.
From the photos, she told me that it was Anatoli Chepiga, who worked for the GRU.
The Internet community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia reported earlier that they had exposed one of the men suspected of being poisoned as Chepiga.
Even earlier, they said that they found evidence that men's current identities are covert identities.
The BBC team travelled to a village near the Russian-China border to Far East, where Chepiga grew up.
A woman in the village recognized young Chepigan Bellingcat from the pictures.
He recognized the same man from pictures of a man who now called himself Ruslan Boshirov.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with Novitshok neurotoxin in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Chepiga has been awarded with the honour of a Russian hero in 2014.
Russia is still denying the suspect GRU connection.
Earlier in September, in an interview with Russian TV, men suspected of poisoning reported that they were tourists in Salisbury.
Old people as throw bags in the social welfare reform
Now there is a living example of what Sipilä's government-defined change limiter for the social welfare reform in practice means.
My birthright, Vaala's social welfare services, is produced by the Oulunkaari Municipal Council, whose former regional director Attendo has been elected as the health service director in 2016.
The directors of the joint municipal council warn the council about the change limiter.
If the social welfare expenditure now rises, the municipal state aid will be cut in the future.
The city centre decision-makers were frightened, and most of them are ready for a major restructuring of the care of the elderly, which would end the institutional care of the health centre and the small unit of the memory sick.
Home care would be increased, which means that elderly people living in remote villages will be ripped from their roots to the health center as "home" to be treated.
Attendo was confident that the municipality would pay its customers.
The left left did not swallow bad preparation, but organised a good public meeting with a lot of relatives, local nurses and delegates from other parties.
I introduced you to the social preparation of the municipality of Vaala in how the elderly are already being treated at home most in the whole of North Ostrobothnia.
Carina Läntinen, a neighborhood councilman, was also involved.
The local paper made a big story about the event, and it brought the Oulunkaari preparers to their hind legs.
Sote manufacturers do not write on any papers that Attendo has built a new nursing home for the Vaala, which is now waiting empty for the residents.
There are no other service providers.
Premiers only talk about the service voucher, but they do not tell you what level of care it will provide or what staff structure Attendo will provide for the elderly until they are escorted.
Without a nurse?
In other words, the health center's facilities will be stopped because there is no doctor's night emergency.
Attendo will also resort to doctors at the Vaala Health Centre.
The example of the whale shows how the central officials run the delegates with incomplete information and the delegates are stabbed against the wall with a change limiting device.
This is how the Centre Party clears the people of Vaala, for who will stay there without security if there is a chance to move away.
Was it one of the election phrases in the city center that the whole country would be kept populated?
President Erdogan of Turkey opened a grand mosque in Cologne
In Cologne, Germany, thousands of people protested when Turkey's visiting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened up one of Europe's largest mosque.
Several hundred people had gathered by the river Rhine since this morning.
Erdogan you are not welcome, read the protesters' signs, and slogans condemned fascism.
Several demonstrations have taken place during the visit to Erdogan on Thursday and the security measures have been strict.
In Cologne, some 10 000 people were expected to protest in advance about the human rights situation in Turkey, among others.
In the vicinity of the great mosque there had also been a gathering of Erdogan supporters.
However, the police had isolated a large area of the mosque from the environment for safety reasons.
In his opening speech, Mr Erdogan praised the success of his visit to Germany and estimated that it strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
On Friday Erdogan and Merkel vowed to rebuild relations with countries that have deteriorated significantly since the Turkish coup attempt in 2016.
However, Mrs Merkel stressed that there were deep differences between countries on issues such as human rights.
Review Surrounded by Visit
Both the mayor of Cologne, Henriette Reker, and Armin Laschet, Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, withdrew their participation in the opening ceremony as the criticism of Erdogan's visit accelerated.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, reported that he had come to a demonstration against Erdogan from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who cannot go out into the streets in Turkey.
They've been arrested, killed and subjugated.
For Erdogan, anything that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the last stage of Erdogan's trip to Germany, North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant proportion of the population is Turkish.
In Slovakia, three people are charged with the murder of a journalist.
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
The DA told me on Friday that three people were charged with the murder of Kuciak and his fiancée in February and other crimes.
Earlier this week, eight people were arrested by the police in an investigation into the murder, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot in February with his fiancée in his home in Bratislava.
He'd been investigating the links between the politicians and the Italian Mafia.
Police have suspected the murders were connected to Kuciak's investigation.
The case and Kuciak's published article have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
Karelian distribution may have problems on Sunday in sparsely populated areas
Because of the fault of printing, Karjalainen on Sunday will also have to be mailed unaddressed.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the magazine in sparsely populated areas where the distribution of the combined boxes has to be performed from memory.
The situation was the same for Saturday's magazine, and the problem may continue on Monday.
Mailing puts extra magazine bouquets in the county.
Other Finnish subscribers' magazines will not be mailed separately until Monday.
The distribution of these magazines is significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
The journalist, Arto Nyberg, will interview Vesa Heilala directly today in his upcoming discussion programme.
Vesa is in the studio telling about her oncoming space trip, which she booked from Virgin Galactical in 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000, which required a bank loan to be paid.
If the original plans had been correct, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the date of departure has been postponed year by year.
Now it seems that after an unlucky test flight that took place in 2014, and even claimed the death toll, things are going well.
If everything goes well, commercial flights will still start this year or at the latest next year.
The number of Vesa's flight is 300, which means that his journey is about one year from the first departure.
The flight lasts 2.5 hours and the weightless space is 5 minutes at 100 kilometers," says the Finnish astronaut about the future on his website.
At the same address he also backgrounds his longing for space.
When I was a kid, I read a comic book called Space Travel and I saw Star Trek on television.
The wars of the stars have been seen, and that's what the thought of...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a harsh host.
Manchester City continued its unbeatable course in the Championship when it fell on Saturday on its home field Brighton's most painty 2-0.
Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero are champions of the sixth victory of the reigning championship team.
Sterling was allowed to direct his fourth impact of the season at close range to an empty target when Leroy Sané found him for 30 minutes on the back pole of Brighton's goal.
Agüero raised his own score to five when he sawed the Brighton defense with Sterling for 65 minutes.
The Argentinean was able to place the 2-0 readings on the penalty bayonet in an easy way.
With six victories and one tie, the City that started the season will lead the Championship with a 19-point catch.
However, Liverpool, who has played less than one match, stalks only one point away.
On Saturday night, Liverpool will face a series three Chelsea in its own seventh-round match.
Youth clubs selected new decision-makers in Joensuu
At its meeting ended on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Associations selected new decision-makers for their next three-year term in 2019-2021.
Anu Sivonen was elected president from Upper Savo and Petra Mäkeläinen from Häme.
The Board of Governors was elected with 40 members and 40 alternates, the Finnish Youth Associations being informed on Sunday.
The youth club meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural hobbies to be known for their quality and safety.
The Youth Society meeting in Joensuu offers three promises in its three-year policy objectives: We keep the doors open for all, and organise equal hobbies regardless of the place of residence and background, and support volunteering and people on their own growth paths," says the Finnish Youth Associations in their release.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkö and surprised Ferrari: "To lose a very important driver"
In an interview with the Swiss magazine Blick, the British driver of the Mercedes was asked if he believed that the release of Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari's services would help Hamilton during the rest of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second driver Sebastian Vettel by 40.
A little less than three weeks ago Ferrari told us that Räikkönen would not continue in the stable next season, while Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Of course, Hamilton does not believe that Räikkönen would slap gloves on the counter.
I don't think Kim's gonna change in the remaining races.
He's an exceptional professional... a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favorite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Hamilton has previously told us that Räikkönen has been one of his models.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and I dreamed of a formula for one, I played F1 on PlayStation all day.
I was always Kim, which is pretty crazy," Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season will continue on Sunday at the Russian sectional.
At the pole station, the Mercedes Valtteri Bottas leaves for the race starting at 2:00 p.m.
The evening paper follows the race momentarily.
The Finnish Championship Championship Championship Championship Championship of Football A became a total farce: the opponent arrived only with 7 players.
Football boys' highest league level ends on Saturday, when the final round of the season will be played.
Before the tour started at 1 p.m., the starting point for the championship competition was clear: FC Lahti Academy will have a point against Vasa IFK in practice.
In order for the situation to change in the final round, the second Ilves in the championship must win the PK-35 and hope for the Lahti defeat.
However, the Lahti Championship was virtually confirmed even before the opening whistle, as Vasa IFK had arrived in the Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one less Vaasa, the match could not have been started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
During the break, the Lahti led the 7-0.
One of the reasons for the players' disappearance is that the team has played partly with the same players in the A-young Finnish Championship series, the P20 series and the C-section of Men's Two.
Vasa IFK has played in the 2nd practically the whole season against the fall.
On Saturday in the final round of two, Vasa IFK is forced to win the JBK guest match and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose its own guest match against KuFua in Toivala, Lake Siilinjärvi.
The car ended up on its rooftop in Eno... according to the rescue department... there was good luck.
The passenger car drifted off the road and ended up roofed in Eno on Juttuvaaranti on Sunday around 9:00.
Four people were involved in the accident.
Two of them were slightly injured, rescue services reported.
Good luck was involved, the press release states.
According to the rescue department, the road was wet from the rain.
The police patrol came to the scene of the accident.
Supo is waiting for new ways to reconnaissance: acquisition and recruitment of equipment already carried out, the activities planned abroad will not be kept quiet
According to Supo's Chief Antti Pelttar, provision has been made for the Intelligence Act by purchasing equipment and training personnel.
At the time of the entry into force of the intelligence laws, a permanent increase of approximately EUR 10 million would be required.
The premises of the National Guard Police (Supon) in Ratakatu, Helsinki, are already fully prepared for the entry into force of the intelligence laws.
Antti Pelttari, the head of Supo's group, tells the media of the West that equipment has already been purchased for future intelligence powers.
Serena Williams is startled by a video of her singing on topless, campaigning for breast cancer awareness.
The tennis superstar Serena Williams is gonna buzz again.
Now he is campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by publishing a video in his Instagram account, in which he sings only hands in front of his breasts, reports the news agency AFP.
The song is the 1991 Australian hit I Touch Myself by The Divinyls.
On the video, Williams supports the Australian Association for Breast Cancer.
"The Divinyls worldwide hit to remind women to carry out regular self-controls of their breasts," Williams writes in his Instagram message.
And yes, this put me in a comfort zone, but I wanted to do it because the subject affects all women, regardless of their skin color, all over the world.
Early detection is everything a and o - it is a game of life for many.
The second author of The Divinyls' song is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago when she was 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which has been made in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
"He died of breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first," says Williams.
The video has now been watched 1.5 million times.
It was released early Sunday morning.
In the video comments, Williams is praised for courage.
Williams dropped out of the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
The background is a fuss in an open tennis tournament in the United States three weeks ago.
Williams came to the main judge of the match and claimed, among other things, that men were accepted far more violently than female gamblers.
Chinese Restaurant on the Mountain Path is not suitable for high-frightening people
The restaurant serves not only traditional Chinese delicacies but also magnificent landscapes.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in the province of Zhejiang, China.
It is literally located on the cliff cliff.
You can watch the forest beneath you if you want.
Ridiculous landscapes high up cause restaurant visitors to catch their breath in the Longquan Mountains.
To get to the restaurant, you have to walk around in the middle of the peach trees.
The restaurant was opened to hikers on 19.9.2018.
Youtube comments wonder where the restaurant's bathroom is located.
Walking to a restaurant requires good ground condition, the location is told.
The Korpela alley runs out today: This is how it ends
Everything good ends in time.
Today it is happening to the domestic country drama Korpela, which has been quite well-liked.
The third season has gone like hot rocks: last week, 722 000 Finns watched TV on the first performance.
The summits in themselves no longer have any practical meaning, as there is no follow-up to Heikki Luoma's and Jukka Mäkinen's series.
In the finale of Jaska and Mirku's relationship, we take another big leap forward, and I think Jaska's mom will be the first to guess what's gonna happen.
Even the relationship between Anssi and Miisa is warm, in the light of recent events it is quite romantic, but then again, Laiho appears.
The police are also sceptical about the sneaky man.
But no one will know what happened to Laiho in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, gets to hear amazing news.
The last will of the faraway will be revealed, which will bring her to the brink of tears.
In a week's time, Sunday nights will continue to run again in Sorjonen.
Korpela alley run today on TV1 at 9:05 p.m.
Do you think it's worth going to work tomorrow with a little cold?
Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
Whether you stay home or not, a lot of people have a lot of raffles.
However, it is worth considering whether others should go and infect, as the disease can be contagious even if its own symptoms are small.
Sometimes the flu's symptoms strike suddenly, sometimes they appear creepy.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your symptoms are small," says Prevention.
So you think it's worth staying home?
According to Prevention, even when a person has no symptoms, the flu is contagious.
The virus is already contagious one day before the symptoms begin and from then on five days to a week.
Children may infect you longer than the disease.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you shouldn't be at school or at work.
You can return to work when your cough stops and your fever is no longer present," says Gregory Poland, professor of medicine.
Training should also be avoided.
Too fast returning to the gym slows the recovery.
And don't forget to wash your hands, pick up your handkerchief and throw your snotty papers in the trash.
Sick to move, though?
If you have to leave your home sick, consider wearing a mask.
Mask does not control viruses, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
Then you don't put your fingers in your nose or mouth," Poland says.
The sneezes are also limited to the mask.
How, then, can one avoid infections?
The best way is to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, it is difficult to avoid the latter.
In the United States, for example, the average person touches his eyes, nose, or mouth every 15 to 30 seconds, Poland warns.
The new Miss Finland repeats the Miss tradition: "My husband is a hockey player"
The hockey player and the misses are often associated.
This was also the case with Alina Voronkova, 23.
The 2018 Miss Finnish crown has been awarded by Alina Voronkova from Pertunmaa.
Beauty now lives in Lahti, where she moved to when she was 15.
Alina's mother is an Inkerinsuomaist and her father is a Russian.
They bullied Voronkov of his father's Russianism at school.
My mother and Father have moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied because I was Russian.
In Pertunmaa I had no friends at all," Alina says at the ceremony of the Miss Finland semifinalists.
After high school, Alina decided to start off on a clean slate and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon, the Miss Bunny found new friends, and the ark started rolling as hoped.
When you're 15, you think you're an adult, but I really wasn't.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Joonas Hurri, who is familiar with Pelicans.
Since his career, the Finnish Championship has played abroad, such as in Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was on the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Cup.
In the early days of dating, the couple lived almost a year in a distant relationship, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could get into the winning three, and with that I would have a career, I don't want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we have to live apart, we have good confidence and the good thing about distance is that the initial spark stays on, Alina grinned in May.
Rejoicing at the continuing growth, death upon us
Almost everyone is concerned about the earth's resilience.
Still, there's just nothing you want to give up.
Sustainable alternatives to continued growth are being sought, but even the theory of moderate economy faces major problems.
The continued growth of the economy has, over a few generations, brought to ordinary people, especially in the northern hemisphere, a standard of living that could only be dreamed of before.
However, the long exceedance of earth's carrying capacity and climate change are threatening to destabilise this market economy's rock leg.
Two men were stabbed on a Sunday night in Kannelmäki at Sitrator at 4 a.m.
A man born in 1986 was seriously injured by a stabbing and another, born in 1968.
Older men are already out of the hospital.
The police have apprehended one person whose possible involvement in the stabbing is being investigated.
Police are also looking for another suspect involved.
These events are being investigated as attempted murder and aggravated assault.
IFK Mariehamn's important point - Inter's coach lamented the mistake
IFK Mariehamn's Simon Silverholt goal against Inter brought the team an important point in the men's football league on Saturday.
Silverholt finished the finish of the 1-1 match by 78 minutes.
Silvelholt got through the right side and happily lifted the ball over the goalie Henrik Moisander.
At the Guest Sergeant's game, the Mariehamns reached two points in the Turku Ball Society, which was located at the stage of the serial raid.
An important goal and a valuable point, summed up by Mariehamn head coach Peter Lundberg.
Mr Lundberg said that the team did not, however, engage in the kind of fight he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes during the opening season, but luckily the Turku paint brought us more into the game.
According to the head coach John Allen of the home team Inter, the game was in control, but the goal was again in pain.
One mistake in our defense robbed us of a full point. Allen was sorry.
We were the best again!
Finland has the most human value in the world
Finland is ranked number one in 195 countries.
The study measured the health and education of the people.
Finland is the best country in the world if you measure it with human capital.
Finland was ranked first in a survey that measured citizens' health and education and learning.
The study measured the change in capital from 1990 to 2016.
The Lancet published the study.
According to the summary, human capital will have a significant impact on how the economy can grow in the future.
The most serious situation is in Africa.
The countries of the continent took seven worst places in comparison.
You're gonna be fine. You're gonna be fine.
STT was the first person to tell us about it.
The paper showed us its underpower skills, the playground isn't sure yet.
Jori Lecturer's strong under-gaming arose when his NHL club Philadelphia Flyers played their last training match before the season began.
Philadelphia won Boston 4-1 and the Lehterä fed Michael Raffl twice to score.
In the last few days, Lehterä has been on display for suspected narcotics.
On Wednesday, MTV reported that Lehterä is one of 23 suspected drug users, some suspected of drug use and some suspected of selling, for example.
The paper has denied that it has committed a crime.
The club and the player have discussed the subject and the NHL is investigating the case.
After the match, Sam Carchidi, a reporter of Philadelphia Inquirer, closely following Flyers, estimates that Lehterä is a member of a group of six attackers, five of whom will be on the NHL team.
In the rehearsal match, Lehterä was excellent, according to Carchid.
In the second round, Lehterä fought the puck for himself with underpower, pulled a defenseman and pitched Raffl, who was waiting in front of the goal, into an open place.
For the second time, the duo's cooperation brought the goal right to the end of the match.
Flyers will begin the NHL season on 4 October with a guest match against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defenseman Urho Libranen is waiting for a team coaching board to decide if he can join the NHL team.
I thought the training camp was good.
I did my best, and I can be proud of this.
Now the coaches are gonna decide if I can play.
I think I'm ready for the NHL," Librainen said in an interview published in the Boston Twitter account.
In the riverboys, Libranen played against Philadelphia for 19.31 minutes.
With the Boston goal Tuukka Rask surrendered four times and rejected 20 times.
Vili Saarijärvi, a defenseman with fly background, scored a 1-0 for Detroit when the team knocked down Toronto 5-1.
In Calgary's ranks, Ilves was raised by defenseman Juuso Välimäki, but Edmonton defeated Calgary 4-3.
Oilers rested on Lake Jesse Puljujärvi and goalie Mikko Koski.
Aleksander Barkov of Florida played for more than 20 minutes and pitched the goal in a local game against Tampa Bay.
Tampa won 3-2.
Columbus defenseman Markus Nutivara fed his team the consolation goal halfway through the final round when Chicago defeated Columbus 4-1.
With the goal of defeat, Joonas Korpisalo rejected 23/27 reels.
More than 180 000 responses to the time survey
Citizens have actively responded to a questionnaire on the decision on Finland's future time.
The question of whether Finland should apply permanently winter or summer time has already collected over 180 000 responses.
The questionnaire opened in Otakaanka.fi service can be answered for less than a couple of weeks.
Respondents are also asked whether Finland should be in the same time as other Nordic countries, Baltic States, Central Europe or Western Russia.
A recent picture shows a change: The strongest man in the world lost tens of pounds
In 2017, Eddie Hall, crowned the world's strongest man, is undergoing a striking transformation.
British Eddie Hall hunted the title of the world's strongest man for a long time and with determination.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 kilo calories a day and, according to Mirror magazine, weighed up to 200 kilos.
Those shirts were 5XL.
Before winning the title, Hall admitted that he was doing damage to his body.
The human body wasn't created to be this size, Hall said.
The British hunted for the world's strongest man race by all means and the family man promised to end his career if he could get the title.
Hall didn't want his kids growing up without a father.
Hall kept his promise and was no longer seen at the 2018 World's Strongest Man Championship in April.
In fact, in Instagram, Hall recently published a picture of him posing in a much smaller shape than his active career.
Hall writes his current weight is 169.5 kilos.
Hall wrote that he is now practicing five times a week with aerobics.
The program includes boxing, cycling and swimming.
In addition, Hall does four exercises a week at the gym.
This year the strongest man in the world was weighed by the Icelandic TV series Hafóór Júlíus Björnsson, also known as Game of Thrones.
Janne Virtanen, the previous Finnish winner of the competition, was number one in 2000.
Restaurant ship M/S Tampere crashed in Pyhäjärvi - "Sturdyly closed with rocks"
The inland waterway ship M/S Tampere ran aground late on Friday night at Akaa Pyhäjärvi.
The Rescue Department received an alarm for a water traffic accident on Friday night after 12:30.
The 30-metre ship M/S Tampere has drifted into the rocks and is firmly attached to its bow, described by the on-call fireman Matti Willman.
There were 19 passengers and five crew members on board.
According to the Rescue Department, personal injury was avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland from the ship.
Now they are being transported by bus and coach to Tampere, told Chief Officer Jari Nieminen to STT after 1:00 a.m.
An ambulance was alerted to receive evacuated passengers to the port of Viila.
For some reason, a ship from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had drifted off its route to the west of the narrow Jumusensalmi.
The police are trying to figure out what happened.
Emergency firemaster Matti Willman told me earlier in the evening that the conditions at the lake are difficult due to darkness and quite harsh wind.
According to the Rescue Department, the fate of the ship is unclear.
Apparently the ship isn't leaking.
After an evacuation operation, divers begin to check the situation there at the bottom.
M/S Tampere, built in 1957, is an inland waterway vessel currently operating as a dining ship with a maximum passenger capacity of 180 persons.
There is also a meeting room for private use on board.
According to the ship's website, the cruiser has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Freezing air fades - see the weather forecast for the day here
This is what the weather forecast for this day and tomorrow looks like.
On Sunday, the clouds are abundant and rain showers focus on the entire eastern part of our country, and in Western Finland the weather pounces and becomes more sunny.
The southwesterly wind is quite moderate.
Daily temperatures are between +7 and +12 degrees Celsius in Northern Lapland.
On Monday, in the southern and central parts of the country, the weather clouds and may become a few weak showers.

The ex-managers are asking Robert Helenius for unpaid fees.
The fight of boxer Robert Helenius's evening against Erkan Teper is overshadowed by a financial dispute.
The evening-Sanomat reports today about the challenge application submitted by Jaakko Helminen, the boxing manager, and Jussi Kokkila, the booked judge, in which Helenius is charged a total of over EUR 80 000 of unpaid management fees with interest.
According to the challenge application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius on 15 April 2014-30 January 2015.
We've tried to compromise, but there's no other choice.
There has been a clear mandate here, and a great deal of work has been done," Kokkila says to Evening-Sam.
Helenius's current manager Markus Sundman sent an answer to The Evening Magazine, explaining what happened to the boxer's view.
Helenius denies his obligation to pay the required amount.
According to his reply, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services to Helenius in a difficult financial situation and promised that they would be able to organise matches and sponsorships for him.
Literally it was agreed that Helenius would be obliged to pay rewards only in percentage of his matches.
It was repeatedly assured that Helenius would not have to pay anything, just receive their organized income.
This is also the normal and only practice in professional athletes' management activities.
Wage work has never been agreed upon and it would also have been absurd in Helenius' situation," Sundman explains in his message.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
According to his reply, Helenius would have liked to have agreed on the distribution of income in writing from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman did not produce the draft until the end of 2014.
He found the proposal poor for himself and cut off cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius did not fight once in his dealings with Kokkila and Helminen.
One year after the end of the cooperation, Helenius had been assigned an "unique but large" bill for the manager's work.
This year's lawsuit has been filed with the same arguments.
Helenius considers the afterhand activities of Helminen and Kokkila to be cowardly, says the counterpart.
Helenius will meet today at the seventh challenger list of ILF's heavyweight league at Erkan Teper's Stuttgart.
A hearty man and a good reporter
Entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the late radio host and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
Long-line radio host and journalist Erkki Pälli died of incurable liver cancer at the age of 83.
The host's death report was published at Helsingin Sanomat on Sunday.
The ad says Pälli died September 3rd.
Pälli told about a serious illness on his Facebook website in March 2018.
The publication was also seen at the time by Ile Vainio, who was saddened by the information about the fate of the acquaintance.
On Facebook, he left it like a farewell earlier," says Ile Vainio.
Vainio thinks Erkki Pälli is a multi-talented expert who became a great journalist.
He remembers Pälli was a liked person with fast hexers and funny things.
I got to know Erkki as a little boy when I first visited Finnlevy when I was 12 and started there as a storekeeper.
Erkki and I got to know each other.
He was a spokesman for Finnlevy at the time and in different positions," says Ile Vainio.
As I progressed to make records as a music producer, there were hundreds of events where Erkki Pälli was a regular editor at all parties doing stories about artists.
He was always knowledgeable and I saw how much fire he had on entertainment, music, and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got directly on the skin of the people he interviewed.
He was a hearty man and a good reporter.
Many became acquainted with him as a respected radio host of YLE, but he also wrote brilliant newspaper articles.
Erkki interviewed me too many times.
He was good at talking, Vainio says.
During the decades Pälli worked in Fazer with Toivo Kärje in addition to journalistic work.
He was a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loire's albums.
However, the greatest passion on the face was radio work in which he had a unique style.
He was doing radio work since the 1960s, and he became known to numerous listeners in Yle ether.
He retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Federation announced on Saturday that the year ending in May showed a profit of approximately EUR 450 000.
The Federation describes a "full translation" of its economic situation, although the economy is burdened with a "significant debt" in the balance sheet.
Executive Director Mika Kulmala praises rapid response and strict financial discipline.
We reacted to the situation last autumn as quickly as possible, taking adjustment measures.
Careful planning of operations and financial management has been pushed through our entire organization, Kulmala says in a press release.
We have also succeeded well in the acquisition of partners and the world Cup's profits were at the highest level during the past competition period.
However, cost management must continue to be precise and, at the same time, we must continue to look for new financing models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
There are dozens of bodies lying in the hospital's backyard in Palu city on the Indonesian island of Sulawes.
Only one building separates them from the area where injured survivors are gathered to assess the need for injuries and treatment.
Patients are also treated outdoors for aftershocks.
One of the people who moved in the hospital area was 52-year-old Baharuddin from Palula, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one kid, and he's missing.
Last time I spoke to him was when he was going to school, Baharuddin told the news agency AFP.
Dwi Haris lay in the courtyard of an army hospital in Palu. He's been injured in his back and arm.
At the start of the quake, he was in a local hotel with his wife and daughter.
The family had been invited back to the wedding party.
I was probably squeezed under a collapsed wall.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my baby.
I hope they're safe, Haris told the AP according to British media.
They're robbing small shops.
At the Palu evacuation center, Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old baby's mother, tried to calm her feverish baby.
He described the atmosphere in the city as tense.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere, said Kusuma.
Many residents of Palu have slept outside or in temporary bamboo homes.
Even if the house is somehow upright, any aftershocks could destroy it once and for all and bury the inhabitants.
According to news agency AP, more than half of the prisoners in Palu prison escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
There were reportedly some 560 prisoners, so there are possibly about 300 fugitives.
Some of the prisoners in Donggala Prison have also escaped, says The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, the prisoners became enraged and set the prison on fire after the guards had told them not to go looking for relatives who suffered earthquakes and tsunamis.
Palu Airport has been reopened mainly for relief flights.
Among the first to land on the field was an army C-130 carrier that brought relief supplies.
Commercial flights to the Palu Airport are allowed only to a limited extent.
The pilots will have to land on the airport without assistance from air traffic control, as the air traffic control tower was severely damaged by an earthquake.
Rain sweeps over Finland at night
On the night against Sunday, a long rainy area is spreading across the whole country from the west, reports the Meteorological Institute.
Most of the rain comes as water, but in Central and Northern Lapland there is expected to be gutter or snow.
The colds of the previous night are not happening again because under the clouds temperatures remain higher.
Cloudier night keeps the lowest temperatures pretty effectively controlled.
Just west can temporarily be visited by the frost," said the on-call meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rainy area will recede towards the east during the morning.
There's pouty or semi-cloudy in the south and west.
In the afternoon, temperatures move up to the height of Oulu at 10-13 degrees.
The beginning week looks similar in terms of temperatures in the southern and central parts of the country, but the weather is becoming more volatile.
Sea areas are subject to wind and wave warnings.
No actual autumn storms are expected for the next few days, but otherwise the typical autumn weather will be variable.
That fall's really starting to hit it off, Ilkka said.
Miss Finland finals aren't on TV.
From IL-TV you can follow the glamour and sparkle of the red carpet of the Miss Finland competition.
The evening magazine's entertainment editors are running a live broadcast on IL TV from the red carpet of the Miss Finland finale in Billnäs.
The broadcast starts at approximately 6:50 p.m.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned on Saturday among ten finalists.
The Miss Finland 2018 final will be in the Billnäs jar in Raasepori.
Before the finals start, you will be able to monitor the atmosphere from the spot on IL-TV live.
Live will start at approximately 6.30 p.m. and continue for about an hour.
This year, the final has been invited to a particularly large number of Miss Finland winners in previous years.
In the jury they are represented by Miss Finland Jonna Ziprus of 1998.
Other representatives of the jury are Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammouda, Minttu Murphy-Kaulinen, Managing Director of Jounin Kauppa, and Katja Lintunen, news producer of the Seven.
We were hoping he'd get to college before going to the Miss Games.
Russian father Dimitri and mother Svetlana in Inger believed in their daughter's success at the Miss Finland final.
The parents of the new Miss Finland Alina Voronkova Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova proudly followed the first moments of their daughter's crown.
They came to the audience from Pertunmaa and were going to drive back home after the final.
I love the atmosphere!
We believed in Erika all the time, but half an hour before it came, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is an Ingerman and Dimitri is a Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian even though she has lived her entire childhood in Finland.
Svetlana says that Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than her career as a Miss.
Alina was often told that when she was so pretty, she should be a miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio host.
It wasn't until later that Alina got excited about the beauty pageants.
The parents wanted Alina to go to university before taking part in the Miss Finland competition.
This is what happened, and in the end Alina wanted to get a Bachelor's degree before the Miss Games.
We already asked him why he didn't participate last year, but he wanted to finish that class.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because she is a wholesome example for young people and adults.
He does a lot of sports and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be on display.
Alina's boyfriend, Joonas Hurri, works as a hockey player in Japan, and he didn't get to go to Finland to cheer on his love in the finals.
Alina's parents believe that the relationship between young people lasts for a year.
Yes, that's the point!
The parents were hoping that the daughter would be able to visit soon.
It's been such a long time since we've had a visit from the ladies.
I'm gonna miss you, even though we've been texting.

Sari Piippo left his career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - the idea of a cartoon came to mind: lack of drawing skills did not slow down
My husband's statement, in which he suggested it to the story I developed as a person, once left my home mom and former EU translator Sari Piippo, a comic book blogger from Espoo.
Sari Piippo says that he was in Brussels as an EU translator of economic and legal affairs until after the fourth child, the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I've enjoyed being a housewife so much.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it occurred to me, what would you do when you were growing up, when even the little kid started to be big.
Then a cartoon came into the picture in 2014.
Piippo says that he had never dreamed of making a comic book, even though he had read Aku Duck, Tintin and Asterix since he was little.
The last time I drew was when I was a child, but when these scripts began to appear, the situation changed.
At first I made some dozen manuscripts in a desk drawer.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is an excellent artist, but I couldn't attract her until summer 2016, when I bribed Viivi with a drawing board.
His zeal lasted for a dozen strippers, and then I had to start trying for myself, laughing Piippo, who tells him that the drawing board was a great incentive for him.
The drawing board is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something done.
I didn't even try to draw on paper, says Piippo about his relationship with drawing, which he usually does at night.
Manuscripts pop into my mind all the time, but usually I don't finish at once.
It's gonna take up to several hours for one three-screen strip.
I may make a screen at a time and like to play with the colors.
It's always the hardest thing to start drawing because drawing isn't my strongest species.
Sari Piippo tells us that he appreciates Scott Adams' Dilbert, among other things, in modern newspaper comics.
The characters of organic hag are a carrot-body mother who has a salad-haired bum.
The other people are Man, Pissis and the Twins.
In the world of organic garbage, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from your own life and social media.
Sari Piippo doesn't want to preach or offer you an obsessive bun even though there are times when there's something going on with organic stuff.
The beep tells me he's reading his show with his husband and his kids.
After all, it's such a great feeling when you look at the comic book you're drawing and say that this is what I've done today.
And there's a lot of challenges for a housewife!

The Indonesian earthquake, the air traffic controller sacrificed himself, didn't leave the crackling tower until hundreds of passengers were safe.
Anthonius Gunawan Agung, a 21-year-old air traffic controller, has become the hero of the Indonesian earthquake.
Agung was left alone in the air traffic control tower until he could safely escort a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people from an earthquake - shaken island.
The young man was on duty at the air traffic control at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in Palu city when the earthquake struck on Friday.
As others fled the air traffic control tower, Agung refused to leave his post before being able to steer Batik Air's passenger plane from the runway to the air.
This allowed him to save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian Aviation Administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport Saturday after the earthquake.
The air traffic control tower trembled and cracked.
Finally, Agung tried to save himself by jumping off the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg was broken and he suffered severe internal organ damage.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was to be transported by helicopter to a better equipped facility, but he died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived," told The Jakarta Post.
The quake intensified further after the flight entered the air, eventually measuring 7.5 magnitude.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian Aviation Administration has respected Agung's heroism in social media.
Mr Rehn wondered about Europe's conclusion to the trade war: "You have to watch the next tweet"
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the global economy.
Growth forecasts have been calculated all over Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly lowered its own economic growth estimates.
In the first morning of Yle, President Rehn said that even if the tension that is increasing does not have a direct impact on Europe's trade flows, it undermines confidence, which is reflected in companies' investment decisions.
The situation also applies to exports of Finnish companies.
For the time being, Mr Rehn thinks that Europe is very talented.
It has been able to build peace with the United States and has helped to calm the situation also with China and Japan.
In Mr Rehn's view, Europe does not seem to be grinding itself into the middle of a trade war.
We'll have to watch the next tweet and then evaluate it.
We have a pretty unpredictable partner in Washington," he said in an interview with Yle.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is Italy, the third largest national economy in the euro area, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and in the Western world.
Last night, the market reacted sharply to the Italian government's presentation of the deficit budget on Thursday night.
Next year's deficit is over 2.4% of GDP.
Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
Five per cent of the country's loan portfolio is problematic credit and over ten per cent is non-performing credit.
In addition, its public finances are weak and the country appears to be once again exceeding its commitment to its European partners.
It may not be worth painting new crises, Mr Rehn replied when he was asked whether Italy was taking Europe into a new economic crisis.
Another issue that is affecting Europe is Britain's resignation from the EU.
Rehn was hoping it would be all right.
The difference would be much more negative.
Rehn started as President of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), will withdraw from office in just over a year's time.
The conversation with his successor has begun.
The name of both Rehn and his predecessor, Erkki Liikanen, has been in the speeches.
It wouldn't hurt to have Finnish names on it," Mr Rehn said and added that he was not going to comment further.
HS's super-popular Black Box performances continue next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black Box performances organised by the Helsingin Sanomat will continue again in the coming week.
Other performances will be seen at the National Theatre on 2nd, 8th and 11th October.
October 23rd Black Box visits Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets for sale to the National Theatre.
The Tampere show is sold out.
Tickets sell Lippu.fi.
During the evening, journalists and photographers on stage will tell a long story they have prepared, which has not been published before in any HS instrument.
There's something again that no one has ever heard.
"There is a strange spy in the night of Helsinki, an impressive report from the other side of the globe and a very topical health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the performance, the audience will have the opportunity to meet the suppliers and photographers of HS and to continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has organized nights of live journalism for three years.
They have been popular and often sold out since the beginning.
Over 15,000 people have already been to the stands.
The black box was awarded at the Bonnier gala as a journalistic act of the year.
Rewarders thanked for a new way of doing journalism and for the desire of journalists to come close to their readers.
The Black Box will be seen at the National Theatre in March-April.
The performance also visits Tampere and Turku.
The presentation to be seen at that time has a different content from that of this autumn evenings.
The missing sponge guy was found through an "unprejudiced experiment"
The Drone expertise of the Finnish police is the world's finest: "We're being asked for training"
According to the headmaster of the Police University of Applied Sciences, the police can use drone in addition to searching for missing persons, for example in crime scene investigations and intelligence missions.
On Tuesday, the Oulu police managed to find the missing sponge guy in Raahe with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, headmaster of the Police University of Applied Sciences, tweeted the case, pointing, among other things, to the fact that "with the help of an unprejudiced experiment and effective education, we are also the world's top player in this area."
Drone is quite a new thing and all the newer on police duty.
There is no statistics anywhere that the Finnish police are the master of the use of drone.
According to Himberg, there is a strong belief that this is the case.
This has been evident, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported at international events.
There is a great deal of interest in it elsewhere," Himberg says.
There would be a lot of visitors to see the Finnish police drone activity.
They're asking us for training.
More widespread
Himberg points out that finding the missing person in Finland's winter conditions as soon as possible is very important.
As noted, in Raahe's case, the lost man was found with a drone in just a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
Himberg says they're supposed to be trained more.
Drone is already widely used in police work and is becoming more common and more common in the future.
That is what I dare say, Himberg says.
In addition to searching for missing persons, Himberg says that the police can use drones for, for example, accident or crime scene investigations and certain types of intelligence.
For example, we need to check out an area a little further, where there may be fears of violence there.
In this case, Drone can be used for preliminary inquiry.
Karelian Rugby got into the first divarie.
Karelian Rugby celebrated in Kuopio on Saturday the victory of the 2nd Division.
The Joensuu people were still in the middle of the match with a 7-12 loss to the Helsinki Rugby Club, but in the second period they found a plot and porched Southern guests 26-12.
At the same time, the 2-Division Championship knew the historic rise of Karelian Rugby to the 1-Division.
In the past, the club has played in number one, but at that time Finnish rugby's serial operations were divided into two levels, the Finnish Championship series and several sections of the 1-section division.
The Society is going to accept the show place, but it's going to be quite a job for next winter.
The current roster of less than 20 players needs to be raised to 25.
The 1-Division also knows the increase in the number of games and longer gaming trips, so fundraising must also be in line with it.
Kotkaniemi starts the season in Montreal, confirms the head coach
The head coach Claude Julien of the Montreal Canadiens playing at the NHL confirmed the club's Twitter account that Finnish Attack Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked a superpromise for Kotkaniemi, 18, in the first round with the number three at the summer booking ceremony.
The attacker joined Montreal's training strength at the end of the summer and has presented strong excerpts at the September training matches.
In his first training match, Kotkaniemi managed to score a goal.
Head coach Julien commended Finland for taking big steps after arriving at the newcomer camp.
The NHL regular season starts next week's night against Thursday in Finland time.
Montreal meets Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round.
What's a good leader like?
Much has been said about leadership in Finland this week.
In an interview with HS, the Chairman of Nokia's Board of Directors, Risto Siilasmaa, explained his book Paranoid optimist, in which he sheds light on his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticizes the leadership of his predecessor Jorma Ollila.
Ollila strongly contested the accusations, but even in previous studies the leaders' inability to act as a team has been mentioned; fear and speechlessness, which in part caused the breakdown of mobile telephony.
The risk-taking capacity and agility of the company's climbing phase disappeared.
During the week there was also a business giant Nordic Business Forum in Helsinki, which drew the Finnish business cream to the exhibition centre.
In addition to the star Barack Obama, 12 stars of the business world came to the stage.
There was enough talk of good leadership.
Leadership legend Gary Hamel said that a good leader must dare to take the company into the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most emotionally dependent on decisions of the past.
John Mackey, founder of the Whole Foods retail chain known for its wide range of organic products, said that the manager must be able to communicate to the entire staff the purpose of the company.
And that purpose cannot be merely making a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, author of the success book's introverts, reported that the most successful leaders are researchedly humble.
They act calmly, quietly and with determination.
Often they are introverts.
Aswath Damodaran, Professor of Finance, pointed out that the qualities of a good leader must coincide with the life cycle of the company.
In the early stages of the company, the director must be able to tell the story on which the company's future is based.
A company that has grown into a mature stage needs a manager who knows the numbers.
These teachings were listened to by 7 500 visitors in the Nordic Business Forum - mainly Finnish leaders.
They were in danger of having an information flash.
It takes a lot to have a good leader.
That is why management often goes wrong, even at the highest level.
Silasmaa and Ollila were also present.
They talked to each other in front of each other in a comradeship.
But they hardly wondered if they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy to judge by an outsider.
Sara Chafak arrived on a gorgeous red carpet straight from Los Angeles - spending most of her year abroad
Model Sara Chafak arrived at the Miss Final in a gorgeous black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finland's impressive dress also had a lace lava.
A little bit of jet lag.
I came back from Los Angeles.
I spend most of my time there, Chafak tells me how he's doing.
Chafak says he's auditioning in L.A.
Among other things, he has done advertising.
He describes his work in the United States as interesting and also similar to that of Finland.
True, he says that work must be done even harder, for there is always a replacement for the model.
You have to push harder and be aggressive," Chafak says.
Choreographer Sonya Lindfors 30 000 euro live art award in Kuopio
Artist Sonya Lindfors won a cultural prize worth EUR 30,000 on Saturday in Kuopio.
Lindfors, winner of the Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art, works on choreography, community activism and teaching.
Sonya Lindfors' art is vital to her surroundings.
His work enables others to work and create spaces for dialogue in the environments from which they have been lacking in the past, the jury described the winner.
In addition to Finnish Lindfors, the winners were a number of international artists.
The prize is awarded annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group operating in the field of live art.
The Danish police found the big Volvo they were looking for in the operation: "We can't tell you where."
The extensive search of the Danish police has produced results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic had been shut down on the bridges of Öresund and Great Belt.
All land and ferry traffic from the island of Sjallan was closed to Sweden, Germany and the rest of Denmark.
The police were looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS reached the head of the Copenhagen Police Media Centre.
We've found the car we've been looking for.
We can't tell you where the car was found yet, Henrik Storm of the Copenhagen police briefing tells Evening-Sam.
Storm says the black Volvo we're looking for doesn't have a direct connection to the threat.
He says the greatest danger is over.
Extra Bladet, a Danish citizen, told me about a police briefing on Saturday.
Director of Investigation Jørgen Bergen Skov was silent about the operation.
He didn't want to tell me what crime heading he was investigating.
But Skov told me it was a serious crime.
It was a threat to people's lives.
There's been a search for three people in this operation.
The police won't tell us if they've been apprehended yet.
According to the paper, the restrictions on ferry traffic have been lifted.
Copenhagen police also followed events in their Twitter account.
According to the police, however, there is no longer any cause for concern for the general public, as the threat was directed at certain people.
The name of Macedonia has caused decades of discord - now the people will vote in controversial elections
In the Balkans, Macedonia is currently voting on a proposal for a new name for the country.
Under the agreement between the Macedonian and Greek Governments, the name would be the Northern Macedonian Republic.
Up until now, Greece has vetoed Macedonia's attempts to become a member of NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The question of the referendum does not mention a new name, but asks whether the electorate is in favour of Macedonia's EU-NATO membership by accepting the agreement.
The vote began slowly at least at a school in the centre of Skopje, the capital city.
Olivera Argirosvka, a retired nurse who voted at the school, wanted support for the agreement.
The referendum will mean a change if it opens the door to Europe and NATO.
It means a change, especially for young people," he said.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) has been designated as officially independent in 1991.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's government has campaigned for the agreement to be approved.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, there is room for tension as to whether the turnout will rise by more than 50%.
The referendum is not binding, but the victory over yes votes would allow the mandate to change the Constitution.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament is needed to change the Constitution.
The agreement must also be approved by the Greek Parliament.
The polling stations close at eight o'clock in Finland time.
That's a great victory!
Robert Helenius knocked out Erkka Teper.
Robert Helenius met late on Saturday night at Erkan Teper's heavyweight professional boxing match in Germany.
A 34-year-old Finn took a look at his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch, near Stuttgart.
Tonight's main match was the Intercontinental title match of the heavyweight IBF.
Its winner may be given the opportunity to fight on Saturday for harder tasks of considerable economic importance.
Helenius solved the match in the eighth round, when he knocked Teper out with his hard left hand.
Teper couldn't get off the floor anymore.
"Nordic Nightmare" already hurt his opponent in the third period, when the German's nose started bleeding.
Helenius and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They were supposed to fight in December 2015.
That's when Teper appealed to the injury and pulled out of the fight.
After that, it turned out that the German had burned twice in an anti-doping test.
Helenius has taken 28 matches from his professional career and suffered two losses.
Teper has won 19 professional matches and lost three times in his career as a clear favorite.
With Hamilton's stable order to win - the difference to Vettel already 50 points
The Formula One Championship again approached its confirmation, as Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes won the Russian Gp and stretched his World Championship point line to Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel to 50 points (306-256).
There's only five more races left.
Valtteri Bottas, who left the pole station at the race, drove second.
Last year in Sochi, Bottas, who won his career, held the lead near the middle of the race, but Mercedes told Botta to let Hamilton pass.
Vettel drove third, Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen fourth.
Red Bull's Max Verstappen was the fifth one to be out of the last line.
A two-man assaulted a Jewish man in Joensuu... was caught a block away.
Two men assaulted and kicked a 31-year-old Jewish man in Joensuu at Siltakatu 12 on Saturday after 6:00 p.m.
According to the police, the men also seized the victim's phone, among other things.
The police reached the suspects, that is, a 35-year-old man in the haywater and a 39-year-old man in the Ylimanz region shortly after the event.
They were arrested as a suspect in a robbery," the police say.
The victim suffered contusions that did not require medical attention.
Elon Musk, CEO of the electric car company Tesla, will leave his duties as Chairman of the Board of Directors.
Musk has agreed with the US authorities.
At the same time, Musk has been fined $20 million for his tweets to ensure funding for withdrawing Tesla from the stock market.
The US Securities Commission, the SEC, has charged Musk with securities fraud.
Musk will continue as Managing Director of Tesla, but the company will also have to pay a fine of EUR 20 million if the agreement between the authorities and Musk is confirmed in court.
Canada fights against time to reach an agreement from Naphta with the United States
Time is threatening to end in the middle of negotiations between the United States and Canada on a free trade agreement with Nafta.
The United States has set a deadline for Sunday, and the negotiators in these countries have discussed closely this weekend.
Canada's main negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed her speech at the UN General Assembly so that she could concentrate on the trade negotiations at full speed.
At the request of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago to reform the North American Free Trade Agreement with Nafta.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached agreement, but there has not yet been agreement with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want to bring the agreement into force before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won the Mexican presidential election, takes office at the beginning of December.
Trump has said that Canada's participation in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that there are plans to sign an agreement at the end of November - whether Canada is involved or not.
In view of these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday in order to give the US Congress sufficient time to assess it.
The neighbor thought the candles were a fire in the Kaakkuri... the fire department was called in.
The candles burned in an apartment building in Kaakkuri, Oulu, caused a fire alarm on the night against Sunday.
A dozen rescue units were alerted because of a possible apartment fire.
It was discovered that the candles burned in the sauna of the apartment apartment had looked like a fire to the house across the street, so the emergency center had been informed.
There was no fire on the target.
The police caught 11 people after the Honka-HJK match - a brawl in the field and at the subway station
After the Honka-HJK-match of the men's football league played in Espoo on Saturday, the police apprehended 11 people, Detective Inspector Teemu Värtinen of the West Uusimaa Police Department confirmed to STT.
The basis for the arrest was protection against crime and interference.
The captives were released after the situation had calmed down," Värtinen said.
Previously on "The Evening Words..."
The match ended 0-0.
After the final whistle, a large number of spectators from the audience reserved for HJK supporters rushed into the field.
The situation led to shoving and fistfights between team supporters.
For example, cavalry policemen were needed to put an end to the situation.
In addition to the field, there was trouble in the area of the nearby subway station, where some of the arrests also took place.
I wasn't there, but what I saw in the photos, the situation was unpleasant, Värtinen pointed to the trouble in the field.
According to Värtinen, no criminal report has been made as a result of the events.
The table stone threw a butterfly swim at its time in World Cup, Laukkanen also swims into the finals
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Tablestone have advanced to the finals on World Cup 3/7 final day in the Netherlands.
The races will be swim in Eindhoven on a short course.
HSS's Tablestone thrilled Finland's record in a 50-metre butterfly suit, where he was second in the early stages of 22.82.
Earlier in September, Tablestone swim in Helsinki during the trip SE 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen, representing Cetu in Espoo, was the 24th time of the butterfly sauna 24.68.
Swimming Club Vuokattin Laukkanen was in the first stages of 50 meters of swim during the sixth period of 30.48 and progressed to the finals.
Laukkanen was in the 15th period of 2.14.25.
Students play a rare delicacy: Ancient tragedy - reduced Oresteia affects its visuality
Ancient tragedies are a rare treat on Finnish stage.
For example, the National Theatre has last seen an ancient tragedy, Sofokleen Filoktetes, in 1988.
Now the Theatre School brought an ancient play trilogy, the Oresteia of Aiskhylos, tour from the National Theatre.
In the Lavat open! projects started in 2015, actors at Theatre University work together with a professional director internationally.
Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin, is the director of this fourth project.
Oresteia was given her international premiere in Berlin in April.
Roiha's reconciliation with Oresteia sums up the story of the end of the blood vendetta of the doomed Atreus and the birth of the rule of law to an hour and twenty minutes, especially by intensifying choir sections.
The work succeeds in being very loyal to the spirit of Kirsti Simon's great Finnish translation (2003).
Dramatic lights and the display of the theater space highlight simple and clear stage thinking.
Its centrepiece is the dynamic between the choir-breaking, name-playing performers, and the choir.
The performance uses both double and triple seats for name roles.
Actors do not leave the scene at all, so, for example, the murders of Agamemnon returning from the Trojan War and Cassandra's war prey are also shown on the scene, contrary to the ancient drama.
Of course, the performance does not stress that it is faithful to the ancient tradition of performance.
Rather, a modern, faithful interpretation of the text is created before the eyes of the viewer, which is constantly aware of its ritualistic roots.
Roiha has succeeded in bringing out a rhythmic group of master's actress students as a close group, even as one organism.
Especially in the choir scenes, actors who bend to very expressive, sculptural group formations will have their rights barely, only by decorating the white curtain, on the stage.
Impressive.
Oresteia's tour continues to Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer manufactures its first hydrogen truck
In Europe, new things are beginning to emerge, especially thanks to the cooperation agreement between Hyindai and H2 Energy from Switzerland.
According to the cooperation agreement published at the Hanover IAA commercial vehicle exhibition, Hyundai will supply a thousand car batch of new models for the use of the Swiss company and its partners.
By placing a fuel cell-powered truck on the market, Hyundai continues to be a manufacturer of hydrogen vehicles on the road marked by Nexo and ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models.
This is the first project in the world that we are taking fuel cell technology further and further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market area of these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the tanker network," said Hyundai Motor's vice president, In Cheol Lee, at the launch of the contract.
Fisting on several occasions in Kajaani
A man in his early 30 ' s assaulted three men in a restaurant in the center of Kajaani and outside it on Saturday morning.
The man first hit one man inside the restaurant, which resulted in him being removed from the restaurant.
Outside he pushed another man into the ground, and in the absence of a third man, the abuser also hit him.
The police caught the assailant.
At the police station, the man still acted aggressively and kicked another cop in the leg.
He also threatened the police with assault and killing.
They took him to jail to calm down.
Three cases of assault and violent opposition to an official are being investigated.
Another assault occurred in the center of Kajaani on the middle of the street Saturday night.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, a 20-year-old Kajaan man hit the victim.
A little later another man knocked him down and the man who hit him earlier still kicked the victim.
Outsiders pulled the assaulters away from the victim and called the police.
But the unsubs already left before the police arrived.
Police are asking witnesses to contact the Kajaani police by telephone 0295 416 520 or by e-mail at investigation.kainu@polis.fi.
Longline radio host Erkki Pälli is dead
Erkki Pälli, known as a long-term journalist, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio host Erkki Pälli, 83, is dead.
He died of incurable liver cancer, which was reported on his Facebook website in March 2018.
Okay, here we go.
Even the doctor has said that, I live day by day, he commented on his situation in the evening newspaper a month ago.
The safety of trade aunts and uncles must be guaranteed
For the first time in 1984, I got paid for a newspaper article.
When a subject on these rings surprises you, it is usually the big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was amazed and at times even a little angry.
I also talked to Erika Kähärä, a working environment expert at the Service Trade Union (PAM).
He says crime statistics don't tell us what's real.
The problem is growing, although employers, of course, claim otherwise.
The police only become aware of cases clearly considered serious and many of the right violent situations remain unreported.
"Of course, businesses have a duty to record their near-miss situation on the basis of the Health and Safety Act, but these statistics remain for internal use and their data are not collected anywhere," he said.
Mental injuries don't end up in statistics.
The problem with violent situations has always been that they do not always cause physical injuries.
Nevertheless, psychiatric trauma can be far more serious than bruising and wounds.
The difference between the violent situation and the threatening violence situation is difficult to draw when an aggressive threat at a certain level must be reduced to violence - even if there is no attack.
Too many people are afraid at work, even if the actual act does not happen.
Some neighborhoods are restless.
The store's got security.
With the opening hours of the stores released, the media also had a pretty high impact on the security of the sellers.
"In those days, many employers organized security services at least for night hours and to prevent working alone," Kähärä commented.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is reached.
This seems to have had an effective effect now, but this will produce a new negative trend.
As security kept the incidents well under control, the impression arose that security would be unnecessary.
Now many places are trying to find solutions that could eliminate expensive security services.
Mild assault is a criminal offence, and it is quite understandable that the victim of the assault does not want to file an inquiry against a criminal who usually lives near the shop.
However, according to the same sub-paragraph of the 2011 law, minor abuse will be subject to prosecution if it occurs at the workplace.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time an aunt or uncle of the store is assaulted, the police should investigate and the prosecution should prosecute.
When a court put a few assailants in prison, and the sentence from there at the hard end of the penalty scale, the manners would be cleaned up.
A society in which the grocery store must be open even in small places almost day and night must guarantee the safety of workers in the store.
Heidi Sohlberg signed to the Miss before the live broadcast started - "Sara, Iiro is then married"
Miss crowning this year is not seen in the traditional way on TV, but the transmission shows Viafree website.
The broadcast is hosted by the former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and the host of Viasat and Viaplay's NHL and KHL studios Iiro Harjula.
Backstage and the red carpet are hosted by Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the host section informed the guests and media representatives of the course of the broadcast.
At first Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a loud applause.
Now all women scream!
Look at this male host, Sohlberg glowed his colleagues in the audience.
The front row races are followed by many of the previous years' Miss Finland.
Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi, among others, sat side by side and Sohlberg threw a little joke in one direction.
Sara, Iiro is married!
Sohlberg took a look at Sarai.
The more likely Sohlberg referred by his throw to the newly divorced Sieppi, who laughed at the comment, although at first he seemed confused.
This is the first time that the kidnapper spoke about his divorce in the Night-Say Weekend magazine.
Missi pretty lady told me that she doesn't want to open the reasons for the divorce in more detail in public, because it's between her and Scrooge Salminen.
He said he wasn't in a hurry for a new relationship. He's gonna focus on himself.
I'm focusing on my own stuff, and especially I'm starting to live my own life alone," Sara Sieppi told me.
Harjula's marriage status came up at a later stage when Sohlberg accidentally mistakenly called Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The plot division laughed at the mistake.
Iiro was married, or how did it go?
Janni Hussi signed for the mistake.
The basic man tortured his tied common-law partner by cutting, burning and feeding strong sauce
The District Court of Ostrobothnia has sentenced a 34-year-old man who lived in Kokkola for numerous crimes against his common-law spouse to three years in prison.
Among the tools used to commit crime were belt, cable, and bundles.
The court ruled that the items in question were lost to the State.
Rank was charged with aggravated rape.
However, this charge was dismissed by the District Court.
Four assaults, aggravated assault, coercion, illegal threats, deprivation of liberty, gross deprivation of liberty and two acts of injury were attributed to the Kokkolaan.
Crimes took place between 26 March and 24 May last year.
At the end of the final acts, the man was captured and imprisoned a few days later.
On Thursday of the past week, the District Court of Ostrobothnia handed down its sentence and ordered a 34-year-old to remain in the Vaasa prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also accused of two gross deprivations of liberty and of aggravated rape on 22 May.
These charges, however, were dismissed as unproved.
The case was handled behind closed doors in court.
The judge, however, issued a public report on the verdict.
According to the district judge, the defendant had subjected his spouse to violence, threats and coercion in situations where he had been tied up.
The accused cut his victim with a knife, smoked with tobacco, fed strong sauce, and poured water and coffee on top of it.
In its judgment, the court ordered the State to confiscate the means of committing crimes: belt and cable, bundles, robe belt, knife and hammer.
Four Witnesses
According to the District Court, the parties continued to live together between acts.
It can be read in the operative part that a large proportion of the most gross acts occurred at the end of the criminal cycle.
Four Witnesses, two women and two men were heard in court.
A 34-year-old victim must pay a total of EUR 5800 for pain, pain, suffering and temporary harm.
He hardly has the money in question, since the sentenced person already has debts to recover from his old age.
The prison sentence is not the man's first.
The evening paper doesn't give a convicted man's name to protect the victim's privacy.
A recent court order isn't valid when you write this.
Europe's four-point lead to the Ryder Cup solution
On Saturday, European golf professionals held their lead in a traditional punch game against the United States.
Europe leads the Ryder Cup to be played near Paris with points of 10-6, while still on Sunday they play twelve doubles.
Europe won three out of four Saturday's four-ball games, and in the afternoon's four-ball game the winnings were evened out 2-2.
Europe's leading stars were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches they played together on Friday and Saturday.
In the past, no European couple had reached the same.
On Sunday, the two of us are looking for more history.
No European player has won five points in one Ryder Cup, and no Americans have won more than three: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns the violent harassment of its supporters in the Honka match: "Violence is not part of football"
On Sunday HJK published a bulletin condemning the interference of its supporters in the Saturday FC Honka match in Tapiola.
"We apologise for the events that have taken place since the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," says the press release.
At the end of the match, about 50 HJK supporters rushed into the field and some seemed to be trying to pick a fight with Honga's supporters.
There was also a fight between supporters.
The organizers did not calm the situation down but needed policemen and also cavalry officers.
HJK reports in its bulletin that the team's players and staff are shocked by what happened.
Events after the match are not in line with the values of our traditional 111-year-old society.
"We are making a sharp break from any activity that endangers the safety of the event," says the press release.
HJK promises to help authorities and event organisers identify security threats and eliminate mild phenomena.
Supporter culture is a part of football and an important issue for HJK.
We fully support positive, cheerful and supportive action in the football arena.
"Violence is not part of it," says the press release.
A Filipino inventor flies a drone car to avoid traffic congestion.
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of clown Fearless.
He's now part of a world-growing group that swears he's invented a flying car, or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
Mendiola, however, does not believe in mass production of its equipment.
According to reports from the world, the man has spent much of his fortune building his dream.
Six years ago, he started developing his flying car.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he's done his first successful test flight... and he's flying on his machine at a height of over seven metres.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic congestion.
I hope that this device will give rise to positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago," Mendiola said according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL anticipates: Tomorrow's work-fighting activities will be visible in children's day care and social and health services
In the public and well-being sectors, the bans on overtime and shift change will be particularly visible in social and health services and in day care for children," says Päivi Niemi-Laine, Chairman of the JHL.
The effects will be extensive and will certainly be visible in such a way that there is not enough staff present.
Everyone has to think about how to get their kids.
It is now up to the employer to ensure that services play and that no one's life is threatened," Niemi-Laine says to STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the shortage of employees was also visible at the beginning of the year when members of the JHL were banned from overtime and shift change due to contractual negotiations.
Employers have made it possible, through flexibility, not to hire staff, but to work overtime or to switch shifts.
This isn't a work battle yet.
In terms of safety and health at work, it is a normal thing to take care of regular working hours and only to do them for each employee.
The JHL's action is against the government's intention to reduce the protection of small companies from dismissal.
Markku Jalanen, President of the labour market of municipal employers, will not start to assess the impact of overtime and shift change bans in advance.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although services may be weakened.
Employers around Finland are aware of this and have prepared what can be done.
The area is so vast, social and health and technical that it is difficult to say.
The impacts can vary very much by industry, region and employer," Jaleinen said to STT.
Elhonen says that last week experience has already been gained with such activities as Super's Local and Basic Nursing Association and Tehy's Social and Health Trade Union, which lasted three days.
Their effects were quite limited.
The ban on overtime and shift change of the JHL applies, among other things, to municipal, church, state and private social and health workers.
For example, family day care providers are excluded.
At this stage, almost 100,000 members of the JHL are involved in the labour struggle.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL's activities may take a long time.
The Federation is also prepared for other collective action if the law on dismissal continues to be prepared.
The government should now admit that this is going to run to the wall and hard.
He thinks that both the Ay movement and the government must meet.
That's what's special about it. The tough ones are already in the barrel, even though the show hasn't been made yet.
The great coral reef is created by children and adults - the gestures of rays and seahorses are studied in the fitness circles of the performance
The Great Coral Reef of the Second Space Collective received its premiere last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was presented for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the previous works of the group, the Great Coral Reef is a work that is built from beginning to end together with the public.
This time, however, a clearer presentation will also be built, which will refresh and crystallize the observations made in the initial exercises.
Theatre play has plenty of fairytale magic for children.
The child's perspective has already been included in the preparation of the work.
Yet, the great coral reef is not a children's performance but a performance that adults and children cooperate in.
It provides adults with information and observations about how children receive information and make art.
Children's ability to throw themselves into exercises and common games also dissolves the distance between adults and children.
Indeed, the great coral reef is somewhat like a satubaletti, a fitness circle and a natural information strike, but it is finally tuned around visits in different, non-human conditions.
The great coral reef begins with familiarization with the movements of corals and coral reefs and fish.
Among other things, six different fitness districts learn about the gestures of rays and seahorses.
Finally, a performance of less than an hour will be made, with music, lights and shiny paints and costumes to help you get to know the life of the coral reef.
In the Great Coral Reef there are both diving people who observe the life of the coral reef and corals that are being viewed.
In addition, we are living creatures looking at corals.
The sights and sights in many directions make the performance dense and life - ridden.
Whether it is a landscape of a living organism, a life - viewing organism, and another life - viewing organism, or a landscape - and all of this at once.
For kids, it doesn't seem that hard.
In other facilities, the group strives to reach the limit of thinking and action, which is challenging to reach when the group is made up of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more significant.
After the workshop, a quiet demonstration will be held at Sitratori on behalf of the endangered corals.
Disasters beyond man's understanding should not be allowed to harden, even though it may be difficult to grasp the significance of exercising one's own compassion in the face of the visions of destruction.
Other facilities have built their works in such a way as to respect the diversity of life, including through political gestures.
There are other generations, there are other kinds of consciousness, other species and future generations of those whose wondering and playing it will clear the way.
Children grow up too fast - I'm glad there were no smartphones in my childhood
Today's children and young people are increasingly irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking when they are younger and younger.
In my opinion, children should be children throughout their childhood, and they should not interfere with their lives because of drugs and sex, because others say they do.
I was overwhelmed when a friend of mine told me he had to pick up his fifth grade sister this weekend from "boyfriend."
When she came to pick up her drunk sister, she told me about her sexual experiences that night.
I couldn't possibly imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we've been told and warned throughout our childhood that drugs shouldn't be touched and sex is an adult thing.
I hope that today's children will be able to live a proper childhood, and they will not have to grow up too early because of the group pressure from friends.
I keep seeing younger girls on Instagram who are wearing makeup in their pictures and revealing their clothes.
Snapchat is used in the evening to take and send revealing images.
Girls are getting harder to guess how old they are.
Today's 13-year-olds can easily look like 18-year-olds and parents.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad there were no smartphones in my childhood.
I was allowed to be a child for many years, and I didn't have to think about what other people think of me.
Yle: The authorities informed the government that the Airiston Helmi case had nothing to do with national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, who was interviewed by Mr Ilkka Kanerva, the Defense Police and Defence Forces visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees earlier this week.
The Finnish government has been informed that the investigation of Airiston Helme is not currently related to national security but to organised crime, reports Yle.
Information from anonymous sources was confirmed to Yle by Ilkka Kanerva, Chairman of the Defence Committee (kok).
According to the Kanerva, this week the Defence Forces and the Protection Police visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is considered primarily financial crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that there would be anything else, Kanerva commented in Yle's interview.
According to the information provided by the High Commissioner, the material seized has so far not been proven to be related to national security, but the investigation is only beginning.
There is no way that we can yet know what can be revealed, says one of Yle's interviewees.
A week ago, extensive searches in the Turku archipelago and mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is purely a financial crime or a threat to Finland's internal security.
Earlier this week, the evening paper compiled a case that goes through arguments both for and against.
Video: Dream paint saved Liverpool's defeated series
Liverpool's 100 percent Championship launch came to an end, but it was still more satisfied with the 1-1 team on Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday it will be exactly a year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and escaped to the 1-0 victory.
That's when Pep Guardiola's combination sent a signal to the entire Valoli League that City was serious now.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And I'm sure Liverpool's manager, Jûrgen Klopp, arrived in West London with the same idea.
The Reds had begun the Champion League with six consecutive victories.
Liverpool started out stronger and in particular Virgil van Dijk seemed to control his own end of the field alone.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had a great league victory on Anfield Road on Wednesday.
That's when Eden Hazard got off the bench to solve the match with a great individual performance.
Now, of course, from the very beginning, Hazard was involved.
At 25 minutes, he first balled in a small space with Mateo Kovacic and Jorgho.
Finally, the Croat saw Hazard rush forward and sent him a perfectly weighted pass.
Hadard drifted a little to the edge of the penalty zone, but then he bombed the perfect left foot bet in the lower corner.
Pool Brasskeeper Alsson was a little slow in his fight, and all he got was his fingertips on the ball.
Mr Klopp certainly felt the loss position lightly unjust because almost immediately afterward Antonio Rüdiger cleaned Mo Salah's steering from the finish line.
During the second period, also Chelsea Veskar Kepa took real action.
The Basque watch reacted quickly to Sadio Mané's bet and pushed the ball from the base of the pole into a corner kick.
At the other end, Alison reset the Hazard drive with her throwing.
The best place for the guests was 72 minutes when James Milner found Bobby Firmino with his focus.
However, the brassi star's buff headed toward national teammate David Luiz, who saved the masters' headship.
It didn't last another 89 minutes, either, as exchangeman Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot at 25 meters.
Sturridge played in his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed an irresistible bet on the upper corner.
Liverpool's 100 percent league launch was completed with 1-1, but it's still on the league lead, along with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also closely involved in the championship with two points behind the tip.
In the conversation on the transfer of the clock, the pots are deep
I remember a few decades ago a magazine asked various Finnish influences what divided the Finnish people.
Juice Widow's answer was the only thing left in mind: the Nen terminal.
Some have a nen terminal in their last name and some don't.
I mean, you could have split lines anywhere, and this was one of the offers.
In the EU, Finland has brought about the abandonment of annual clock movements.
Very many agree that clock movements twice a year have been a fool's job and have caused many problems.
Eventually, this achievement seems to be at least the easiest part of the solution in Finland, although it has not been easy.
The hardest thing to do now is to decide what time it will end up at: the present summer or winter time or some other time zone.
The public can also comment on this on the otakasta.fi page.
The questionnaire has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open until Friday 12 October.
The debate is intensely taking place on coffee tables and social media, and everyone has their say.
Those defending wintertime justify their position with the influence of the morning light on people's well-being and summer time defends eveninglight with the influence on people's desire to go outdoors and hence well-being.
Both sides have strong supporters and good arguments.
Even studies show that morning light beats people's day and gives them refreshment.
On the other hand, if you do not suffer particularly from awakening in the dark, the light will increase people's movement outside and give you better opportunities to do yard work in autumn, for example.
The amount of additional light after the normal working day has already been calculated for its class.
I'd rather have both, but we can't help our location in the north of the earth.
Winters are too dark and summers too bright for many anyway.
Typical of the debate on the subject is that one's own vision is being pursued and the other's view is being strongly opposed.
The arguments of the counterparty are hardly listened to, because the most important thing is how it feels.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on the matter, it is rather pointless to try to turn one's head.
It's a waste of gunpowder.
The subject is awfully easy for debate, because it does not require a great deal of attention and a feeling of mutu is sufficient to justify it.
In general, there is a sharpest and equally infertile dispute over similar types of issues.
I'm sorry if the wrong option is chosen, but I think that's something we can adapt to.
And it always offers a suitable scapegoat if life feels sad.
Josba fought for the nearest foreign victory
Josba's first guest game at the gym bandy in Divar produced a total of three series points against Nurmo's Jymy.
Josba left Seinäjoki on her way home with a joyful 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Grass still led with paint at the beginning of the third period, but Josba sought compositions and recycled men in chains.
In 50.47 the brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi conspired to win the 6-5 goal.
As both teams cooled down, decisive minutes were played at the level.
Josba's most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was fire-powered anyway when Teemu Tuhtinen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Miika Kosonen also played in the second chain at the time of her goal (1+0).
Josba has six points after three series rounds.
Next up is O2-Jyväskylä with guests in two weeks.
Eno's Church Sunday's 200th anniversary party
The 200th anniversary of Eno's church will be celebrated tomorrow Sunday, partly in a very sad atmosphere.
The arson of the Church of Accelerating Risk a week ago was a shock.
Even Uncle's church was guarded two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, there's still a celebration tonight.
Even if no one would like to do so, Eno's church is now the oldest church in the Joensuu Congregation Group.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been Eno's heart despite all the municipal and other connections in the world.
Family Mass starts at Eno church today at 10:00.
Then we move to the parish house by the Karelian banquet table.
There's a lot of stuff on the show all day, both inside and outside.
For example, you can visit the church building with the guidance of Ari Räsänen, who has retired for 37 years as parish master.
The celebration of the church's birth also marks the end of an era.
The parish house, built in 1982, has already been disused, keeps its doors open for the last time today.
We are now in evasive quarters at the former municipal hall," says Markku Koistinen, a chaplain.
The church house was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has been standing healthy for that 200 years.
Elon Musk resigns from the chair of the Tesla government - Fraud charges were settled for $40 million
The electric car manufacturer Tesla and Elon Musk, the company's CEO, have agreed their case with the US Securities Supervisory Authority (SEC).
The SEC suspected that Musk was guilty of securities fraud, and Musk was in danger of being sidelined by the company he set up.
However, Musk is allowed to continue as Managing Director of Tesla.
Instead, Musk has to step aside from the chair of Tesla's board for three years.
The company has to hire the chairman of an external board.
Musk will also be subject to stricter supervision.
According to the agreement, Tesla will have to hire two independent directors and monitor Musk's communications more closely in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk both pay $20 million (about €17 million) to settle the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent further market disturbances and harm to Tesla's shareholders," says Director Steven Peikin of the SEC.
The case began in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might withdraw the company from the stock exchange.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding was secured.
The tweet temporarily increased Tesla's share price.
The SEC suspected Musk was guilty of securities fraud.
According to the Agency, the tweet was false and misleading and Musk had not talked about the arrangement with other management or potential sponsors of the company.
In practice, the Bureau accused Musk of misleading investors.
On Friday, the SEC announced that they would sue the company and Musk.
The SEC stated that it demanded that Musk be fined and that he should no longer be in charge of listed companies.
The SEC's challenge scared the investors, and Tesla's share fell strongly.
More than 800 people died in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
The number of deaths from the Indonesian earthquake and subsequent tsunamis has risen to at least 832, reports the National Agency for Disasters, according to AFP.
It is believed that the number of deaths is still increasing, as the damage is still to be solved.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure could reach thousands.
The Friday earthquake raised a tsunami that struck the city of Palu on the island of Sulawes.
Immediately after the quake, a warning was issued that was quickly withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all known dead are, at least for the time being, Palus.
The emergency services are concerned, among other things, about the Donggala region near the centre of the quake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Already many people are known to have died.
Ruined Requests for Help
The Indonesian army has been alerted to rescue workers in search of victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived in the affected area today, urged the soldiers to continue their rescue work day and night.
One of the centers of the rescue work is the hotel in Palu, where 50-60 people are believed to still be in the ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, Head of the Rescue Department, reported that one person was dug alive during the night from the ruins of the Hotel Roa-Roa, popular by business travellers.
We also heard people asking for help, he told us.
According to Syaug, heavy cleaning equipment would be urgently needed for the quake and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing loved ones.
Help me, you in Palu and nearby.
My friend's family members are still missing, one writer appealed to the Facebook group.
Politicians' phone numbers leaked into the hands of troublemakers in Britain
Many British politicians were harassed when their contacts leaked due to shortcomings in the encryption of the application.
Disturbers had access to, among other things, the telephone numbers of ministers.
This was an application used by the British Conservative Party in the government.
For example, Michael Gove, Minister for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, were harassed.
Several MPs received harassment calls.
Due to the application's lack of encryption, the public was able to access the profiles of politicians in the mobile application of the Conservative Party's annual meeting.
The public was able to access profiles using a politician's e-mail address, which was easily available online.
The person who login to the profile was able to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to turn Boris Johnson's profile photo into a porn picture and a title insult for a moment.
Michael Goven's profile photo was replaced by the media mogul Rupert Murdoch's.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows login to other people's profiles with their e-mail addresses.
Then you can check the contact details of the profile person and, for example, send messages in his name.
The meeting app made each journalist, politician and participant's telephone number public, Foster criticized.
The Conservative spokesman apologized for the leak.
He said that the technical problems have been solved and the application is now working safely.
The British Information Authority (ICO) supports the data leak.
The application was prepared by the Australian Crown Comms company.
The opposition Labour Party is critical of the fact that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
Every week, there are a large number of applauding Poles in the audience of The Wall Finland.
Discreet viewers drew attention to the reactions of the studio audience in The Wall Finland.
The Wall, a fast-occased US format, landed in the Finnish version of Four last Saturday.
The game show hosted by Heikki Paasonen is described in Poland in the same studio where other international productions of the format are made.
In the Polish studio, the possibilities for filming were exceptional, as the large 12 m high game wall of the format required space from the farm.
During the starting period, the social media raised the programme's studio audience, which was betting on Polish.
On Twitter, there was a discussion as to whether the Polish who may be sitting in the studio understand anything about the game being played in Finnish.
Unne Sormunen, head of the four domestic programs, is enlightening Evening Magazine.
He tells us that there are close players in the studio audience, other Finns living in Poland and Polish viewers.
In Finnish production, the audience is made up of international clappers, just like the audiences of other countries in the same production space.
In Finland, too, there are such groups, so-called professional audiences who go to different programs, Sormunen backs up.
He reminds us that following the game itself is not so difficult to understand even if you do not understand the language in which it is played.
Red and green wall-falling balls are easy to distinguish.
However, interpreters are present in the studio for foreign speakers who do the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret as a simultaneous interpreter for the studio director all the time.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells them what kind of laps to throw there, for example, and what the situation is going on," says Sormunen.
He compares the situation with how David Hasselhoff was recently supplied in domestic production.
A few years ago, David Hasselhoff attended Talent Finland's shoots in Finland.
He always had a simultaneous interpretation in his ear, and he knew everything that was spoken in Finnish in the illustrations, the sum of the Ring.
The typhoon that hit the southern parts of Japan is moving toward the main islands - authorities warn against landslides and floods
Authorities also warn against possible landslides and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in typhoon Tram, but according to the authorities, major injuries have been avoided and there is no record of fatalities so far.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so hard that it has turned the cars around.
According to the NHK public radio company, people have been evacuated and electricity has been cut from over 300,000 households.
More than a thousand flights have been cancelled, and bullet trains are at a standstill due to the storm.
The storm is expected to strike near Osaka around half a day in Finland time.
The capital Tokyo is not directly on the route of the storm, but there will also be strong winds and rains.
Train shifts have been cancelled today in Tokyo.
Weather scientists say that Trami is tormenting Japan until Monday.
The sky of the aces became even darker
It's been a bad start for the aces.
The sky became almost pitch black when the team lost on Saturday on its home field at Vaasa Sport 3-6 (0-2,0,3,3-1).
The Porians now have five consecutive losses, with a total of two points for six rounds.
No Aces defenseman or two lower chain players have scored a goal yet.
Pressure is also increasing.
Against Sport, the audience disappeared from the hall at a time when nearly half of the game was left.
Six games have just been played, and there is no reason to give up, of course.
Of course, you have to be worried because that's how weak we played.
The performance of the second round was especially embarrassingly bad, Jarno Kärki, who made 1+2 for Ace, told me.
Of course, Sport enjoyed the victory.
The team had a game underneath Friday night, so you would have thought it would be visible in making it.
Maybe it did, but the Aces couldn't take advantage of it.
The number of visitors to breaddays continued to increase
The mother of breadday Pirkko Hyvärinen wonders about the audience of the big hall.
Somehow you thought that maybe not so many people would come this year, Hyvärinen ponders in the morning.
In autumn 2017, together with Bread Day, the Finnish Tractor Village Championships were organized, so perhaps it would be expected that the number of audiences could even fall slightly from the previous year.
However, it was different; the halls were briskly blocked before 10:00, salesmen said that the products had run out, more news porridge was sold with nearly 500 doses and Hyvärinen heard that there was an increase in the number of cars.
The estimated number of visitors has been about 6,000, says Hyvärinen later this afternoon.
The five hours of the morning and afternoon were especially busy for families with children, which must have attracted them to a record number.
In addition, Hyvärinen estimates that the event will reach further and further.
Sellers also curve to Liper every year from a larger area.
This year, nearly 100 of the rapporteurs, handicrafts, pastries and harvesters had arrived at the breadkeeper.
Breadday's mother Pirkko Hyvärinen admired the audience from the auditorium.
At the beginning of breadday, the harvest was blessed.
In the children's series, Teija Kiviniemi's beautiful bread won the public vote.
Eleven different kinds of bread came to the children's bread competition.
Marjatta Vepsäläinen, winner of the rye bread competition, spent the day at the martian pie workshop.
7 x most beautiful lamp - here you will recognize a good lamp
Resurrect the space, create the right atmosphere for the interior, and read the book without weary eyes.
It's worth spending money on good lighting.
We gathered three good reasons to invest in enlightenment.
Tips were given by Tarja Jokiniemi, Sales and Marketing Director of Innolux.
♪ Do me a favor ♪ ♪ With your eyes ♪
Illumination is becoming more important, the more old age is behind it.
Enough light can help many with problems that arise with age, as the accuracy of vision decreases and more and more glares suffer.
The need for light also grows older.
A 60-year-old needs light three times as much as a 20-year-old.
It is therefore worth investing in the effects of light and the characteristics of the luminaire for health reasons.
A good lamp gives enough light, but doesn't dazzle, Jokiniemi winks.
Create beauty around you
Beautiful interior can only be seen with the right lighting solutions.
At this moment, the decorator can afford a choice.
The popularity is a Japanese style that combines Scandinavianism and Japaneseism.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style inspired by the '70s with its strong colors, metal with different shades or ice cream colors has become a boom.
Genuineness fascinates the same way as other interior decorations in the home.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Show Your Personality
On the other hand, more is being invested in home now than before, and the interior has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, you want a tailor-made, bold luminaire that has a story to tell.
People are clearly seeking Finnish and Nordic products, whose origin and designer are known.
So let's be very design conscious," says Jokiniemi.
Home is not necessarily the latest trend lamp, but a timeless classic for which many years have been saved.
Certain types of timeless, jewelry-like and elegant classics survive year after year," says Jokiniemi.
Thank you and goodbye!
KooKoo showed the door to the Canadian attacker after three games
KooKoon and the attacker, Brendan O'Donnell, are breaking up.
The Canadian invader played in orange black a total of three League games without power points," KooKoo says in his release.
O'Donnell moved to KooKoo in August with a one-year contract including a trial period until the end of September.
Last season, a 26-year-old attacker played in the KHL ranks of Kunlund Red Star and in the KHL farm at the VHL in KRS Heilongjiang.
There's no record of O'Donnell's new company yet.
The gambler wants to set an example in recycling - the goods go to the world in recycling boxes, the plastic changed to paper
The game speciality Player is now recycling not only games but also packaging materials.
The products of stonefoot shop customers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered from the online store are packed into packaging, for example, from importers.
All packages that come to us go for reuse.
We may use the boxes ten times, as long as the package is in condition to be used," says Ville Puurula of Oulu Player.
As a soft material, the company mainly uses newspapers and similar recycled material.
Bubble plastic is avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we are also going to move on to recycled material in envelopes.
The movement wants to set an example for others.
According to Puurula, recycling is not an extra effort.
It's not a big problem to start recycling.
There will also be financial savings when cardboard packaging, for example, is re-used.
Recycling is natural for Player's operations, as in addition to new products, the key product range of the shop includes used games and equipment.
Acquisition of every fashion-conscious: One and the same shirt works in every costume
Classic clothes work from one season to the next in a costume.
With their versatility, they provide the basis for a good garderob, as it is easy to gather different costumes around high-quality classics at an affordable price.
In autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality needles.
This category also includes black polo.
Black knitting made of natural material on polo collars cannot have an error procurement.
You can combine your clothes with straight pants, tull skirts and jeans, and you can create both a restrained suit and a snotty style around it.
The poloneule is suitable for both a young modern dresser and a classically sophisticated stylist.
This is how you create style.
Autumn trendiloo is born of golden-brown and broad-legged corduroy pants, black polo sweater and gray paws.
The classic polo sweater, along with other classics, the blue-green scotch skirt and the burgundy loafers, make up a feminine and sophisticated outfit.
Bring the edge to the black polo needle by combining it with relaxed trendy clothing - a jeans skirt, high boots, and thick pantyhose.
Young and elegant!
Russian intelligence has a long tradition of sabotage
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence SVR or military intelligence GRU had abandoned this policy.
During the Soviet era, sabotage activities were specialized in so-called DRG groups.
The name comes from the Russian words diversion-razvedyvatelnaya gruppa: sabotage and intelligence team.
The agents of the KGB's security service in the West prepared detailed plans for important sabotage sites, says Vasili Mitroh (1922-2004) who defected to the west of the KGB.
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
The targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipelines.
In Germany, the KGB acquired a Bundeswehr, railroads, game keepers and road workers' uniforms and accessories for covert operations for DRG groups.
This trick was used by Russian parachute soldiers in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed as local Ukrainian police riot equipment, set up inspection posts on roads leading from the peninsula to Ukraine and isolated Crimea from its motherland.
Agents of the Cold War period hid supplies containing mines, explosives, lighters and media for sabotage groups in the terrain.
Even in 1998, a stash of KGB was found in Switzerland, which exploded when the authorities sprayed it with a water cannon.
Police reached four drunk drivers in the province at night
The police caught four drunk drivers across North Karelia on the night between Friday and Saturday.
In Joensuu, an 18-year-old man from the Gulf of Kontio blew 1,57 per mil.
At 4:30 a.m., he drove at the beginning of the Kajaanings with two passengers.
At 4:00 a.m., the car went into the ditch on Kolvijärvi Kuorevaarantie, and the 19-year-old local man in the car alone blew 1,54 per mil, according to the police.
He didn't get any serious injuries while he was out.
A 20-year-old out-of-town man driving a passenger car in the centre of Outokumpu blew 1,33 per mil into the alcometer.
The police suspect the male drivers concerned of a serious drunken driving and the driver of Lake Polvijärvi in addition to endangering road safety.
On Saturday morning, at the intersection of Öllöläntie and Hoikantie, a 36-year-old man carrying a local van blew 0.52 per mil at Tuupovaara.
He's a suspect in a drunk driver's license.

HPK holds Riska in its ranks for the rest of the season, Lehtinen's probation period ended
Mika Toivola, the sports director of Hämeenlinna HPK, says that Filip Riska (key) has been important to the team during the start-up, under-gaming and the defensive role of field 4.
Philip Riska, who played early autumn during the trial period, will continue at Hämeenlinna HPK for the rest of the season.
The success of experienced Riska, 33, in the roles offered to him, assured the management.
Philip has been an important piece for us in the openings, the under-gaming and the defensive role of field four.
Even though there is still improvement, it is good for the young team to stick to such an experienced player, Mika Toivola, HPK Sports Director, commented in the Society's press release.
According to Toivola, Riska's value rises when playing the League's solution games.
Riska has played league hockey before at JYP, Lukko and Sport from Pietarsaari.

True story today on TV: The climber was left to die twice
The American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on man's own experiences.
Tonight's movie is based on them.
Everest now gets his premiere on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating blizzard surprised climbers at Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákur's guidance for 2015 tells of a survival struggle that has been dealt with fertilely.
There have been movies and documents about tragedy in the past.
We're going through some real events in this case too.
22 years ago, the world's tallest mountain took the lives of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced expedition leaders: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who was the guide to Weathers.
Weathers' life could be saved by an eye surgery performed before he left for Nepal.
As a result of this and the pressure of the air, he lost sight, which meant that the conquest of the peak had to be skipped.
Rob Hall kept going and never came back.
But Weathers' struggle for life and death had only just begun.
When the storm came up, he got lost and couldn't find his way back to camp.
When they came looking for him, they found him in such a bad condition that no one believed in survival.
Weathers was left to die.
But like a miracle, he still got on his feet and found the others.
Weathers, badly frostbite, was thought to be still dying, and once again he was left to his own fate.
It is clear that, contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
Even climbers began to believe in the possibility of giving him help at some point.
In the movie Beck Weathers, it's Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today has been a celebration of the 200-year-old church of Eno.
Uno's 200-year-old church has been celebrated today on church hill.
The church was inaugurated on October 4, 1818, and to celebrate the anniversary of the anniversary, the whole family was prepared for Sunday.
The party started at Eno's Cathedral at 10 a.m. Family Mass, after which there have been items from the Karelian banquet table at Eno's parish house.
The church was full.
517 persons participated in the family mass.
Eno's vicar Armi Iron Mountain was glad that so many people had come to church.
It is a great joy for a long time to come and gives strength to work," says Iron Mountain (in the picture).
Many have been touched by the fire of the Church of Accelerating Risk, and it was not ignored at the 200th anniversary of the Eno Congregation.
Eno's church is now the oldest church in the Evangelical Lutheran congregations of Joensuu after the Church of Shiningsvaara was destroyed in a fire.
The wooden church at Acceleratingsvaara was completed in 1770.
At the risk of acceleration, a hobby was held this morning, in which the church destroyed in the fire was silenced and remembered.
Photos and videos: Medican flashed its power in Greece - The sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A powerful autumn storm of hurricanes rolled from lunch to Greece on Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane is named Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red weather warning in the areas of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Kyclads and Crete.
The pictures taken from the area show a lot of flooding all over Greece.
A video published on Twitter shows how a river has suddenly appeared between houses in the city of Kiato in Corinthia instead of the street due to flooding.
Another video shows how a car has been carried by floodwaters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese Peninsula, strong seafaring was caused by strong winds.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens instructs people on their Facebook pages to prepare for the storm in Greece.
The Delegation calls for monitoring of weather reports and local authorities' instructions.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or meditan, brings with it heavy rains and even a flood risk.
According to CNN, according to a study published in 2011, medians occur only once or twice a year worldwide, typically around September and October, when sea temperatures are still high.
Now a blowing storm left floods in Tunisia and Libya before continuing north and towards Europe.
There has also been concern in Greece about refugee camps in the islands, such as Lesbos.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in the camps have limited access to proper protection.
In the summer, too, areas destroyed by fires in Athens will be hit by the storm.
There was also a median raging in Greece last November.
We must not go to the sea now, but flights on schedule - thousands of Finns are currently on holiday in the Greek islands threatened by autumn storms.
Trips to the sea are cancelled, and even when walking, be careful not to fly branches or other bulk in a storm.
Guides have distributed such instructions to more than 3 500 Finns who are on holiday via the sun tour in Greece this weekend.
Instructions will be needed, as even the storm of Zorbas, which is going to hit the Greek islands this weekend, has been predicted.
For example, in the vicinity of Crete, wind speed can rise to up to 45 meters [45 m] per second.
Heavy rains add to the wretchedness of the weather.
According to to tour operators, all passengers travelling from Greece to Greece via solar tours and Tui have been warned of severe winds by SMS.
Still sun and heat in the air
According to Inka Ikonen, an expert on solar travel communications, by Saturday evening, the worst has been avoided at the resorts.
For example, flights have landed and risen according to the normal schedule.
Sure, we'll keep an eye on things all the time.
Safety ahead.
Antonia Schroderus, the media operator of Tui, tells us that their flights have also taken place on schedule.
We are in constant contact with our personnel at the target.
At least Crete was still peaceful, she told me about the early evening on Saturday.
At present, there are over 1 500 Finnish passengers in the most popular Greek islands, Rhodes and Crete.
In addition, some hundreds of passengers are on holiday in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island is likely to hit on Sunday morning.
On the other hand, Saturday afternoon in Rhodes, the sun had shone, and the temperature was 27 degrees Fahrenheit [27 ° C.]," says Ikonen.
It is estimated that Zorbas will turn into the next Turkish nuisance, albeit somewhat relaxed.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and have checked the number of Finns flying to Antalya in Tui, for example," says Schroderus.
Shirly Karvilla and Janni Huss have perfectly identical evening suits at the Mississippi Final - this is how they react to the situation.
The media personality and fitness-beautiful Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Finland final on Saturday in an open-back evening dress.
Hussi says she got a dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals who found me a very nice dress for tonight, Hussi smiles.
Exactly the same silver evening dress had also been chosen by host Shirly Garfield.
The two themselves also noticed their uniforms and responded laughingly to the situation.
Karvinen told Night-Say that he was in a hurry to prepare, and he had to get ready on the plane.
Hussi serves as a backstage and red carpet host at the Miss Final, and he talks to the front-row stars.
Hussi has a fresh move behind because she moved from Kamppi to Jätkäsaari on Friday.
I'm gonna stay there for now. Let's see what happens.
The important thing is that the new apartment has its own office," Hussi pondered.
Before moving, Hussi was on vacation alone in Greece.
It was wonderful. I was just staying at a hotel for a week without going anywhere.
When stress erupted, I got the flu, but otherwise the holiday was really successful," Hussi says.
Shirly Karvise's behavior on the plane attracted a lot of attention... to the curious eyes of pensioners.
The host and Miss Finland Shirly Karvinen of 2016 reported that on the red carpet of the Miss Finland final she had enough to do with radio lines and Love Island Finland photos.
There has even been so much haste that Karvinen entered the finals directly from Finnair's flight.
I put on some makeup and I put on some hair on the plane.
This is the glamour.
Change of evening dress at home, Garfield laughs.
Garfield says he pulled out his makeup in the middle of retirement.
His preparation also attracted the attention of fellow travelers.
I had a big mirror and I saw people's eyes in the mirror.
At least everyone thought it was fun to wear my makeup.
Garfield flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen says he enjoyed his post as a Finnish host on Love Island.
He describes his experience as being haltable so far.
Garfield says he went to see the singles on Friday.
Somehow it's really raw.
They're people's true feelings, Garfield describes the feelings of singles in the program.
How do I put on my knee boots?
Three Perfect Example Costumes
Classic clothing is a garment that works from one period to the next in a costume as it is in a costume.
Often classics are decades old, but sometimes even more modern individuals are included.
A few years ago, overcrowded knee boots that became the hits of the autumn and winter season have not gone anywhere.
According to their name, the boots above the knee repeat in style from year to year and from season to season.
The impressive boots share the opinions of the users, but a bold model is worth a try, well - boldly.
In fact, overcrowded boots are suitable for any type of costume.
Whether it's jeans, lace, stylish or tight, the simple leather or artificial leather surface of the boots works.
Tall boots look good both in the festive look and in the everyday costumes.
Black overcrowded boots are well suited even for gentle costumes.
Appropriately, they balance the femininity of a pink, blossomed dress and a gentle, fat knit.
A fresh but autumn-style everyday dress for a romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro-spirited outfit comes from a long copper-brown velvet velvet, over-armed, spectacular earrings and a staple bag.
Even though the overcrowded boots have a certain refinement, they also fit perfectly in a relaxed everyday outfit together with a t-shirt, long shorts and a trendy cap.
Lovelyly easy and yet so elegant!
Two robot cars start operating in Espoo
They will operate for the rest of the year and pick up passengers, the City of Espoo informs.
Robot cars in Otaniemi play a role as a bus simulator, as next spring traffic will be launched by a robot bus in the area.
The project develops and pilots robot vehicle traffic throughout the year and tests the technical performance of vehicles under Finnish conditions.
The experiment shows how robot cars do on the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in the real environment," says traffic manager Johanna Nyberg.
For the first time, robot cars travel completely automatically among other traffic without special traffic arrangements.
The safety of vehicles is always the responsibility of the auxiliary passenger seated on board.
The vehicles constantly sense their environment with several sensors and assess whether the driveway is free.
If it is not, they will interpret whether a vehicle, bicycle or snowflake, for example, is detected, says Harri Santamala, Managing Director of Sensible 4, who is responsible for the development of robot traffic.
Robot cars travel all autumn three days a week: Tuesdays from 1 to 3.30 p.m., Wednesdays from 10 to 15 p.m. and Thursdays from 10 to 15.
Robot cars stop at six stops along the route and pick up passengers.
Robot car stops are identified by the stop markings.
The best way to get a ride is from Okaare stop number one.
The bass player from the movie band fell off the stage in the middle of a gig and got hurt.
The Mokoma group announces a surprising situation on its Facebook site at the Tampere Pakkamoi gig.
The concert of the Mokoma band at Tampere Pakkahuone took a dramatic turn on Saturday when the band bass player Santtu Hämäläinen fell from the stage while performing.
It happened when the band was doing the last song of the evening.
The twilight's wrist was broken.
The band will inform you on its Facebook website.
"We're alive!"
Santtu tripped last night at the Pakkathuone from the stage in the last song and broke his wrist.
Let's wish the metal brother a quick recovery!
The rest of the tour can be done with backup. It says on the website.
The fans of Mokoma respond with concern to the image update, where the bass player Santtu lies with a cast in his hand on the bed.
We've been waiting for this news. It was pretty bad news.
The relief is great, the bones are healing, fortunately, over time.
Come on, get back to Santu and have a good tour with the rest of the band plus the replacement!
And thank you for last night, the gorgeous gig was, but will you promise to leave this strong drama out of the gigs?
Police supervised hunting in North Karelia and Savo
On Friday and Saturday, the Eastern Finnish Police Department carried out hunting surveillance with Metsähallitus and the Finnish game centre in North Karelia and Upper Savo, the police department's wilderness persons reported in social media on Saturday.
The main focus of surveillance was the legality and legitimacy of hunting.
Each hunter was checked with a hunting card and a required hunting permit on government land.
In addition, licences for the possession of hunting weapons and the permitted quantities of self-loading weapons used in chicken canning were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during surveillance and only one hunter was found missing the required hunting permit.
The hunter was assigned 12 daily fines for unauthorized fishing.
In addition, 133 drivers were inflated by the police, two of whom are suspected of drunken driving.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic offences during the fine procedure, police times.
To sum up, hunters comply very well with the authorisation of hunting.
Many hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
One hunter said that "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time anyone has checked the permits."
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue to monitor hunting in the autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
The mute goes to Turkey to monitor the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkänen (English) will be travelling to Turkey in the next few days to follow the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
It has been decided to take 530 Syrian refugees to Finland this year from Turkish refugee camps.
Selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year, with representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy and the police.
The delegation is already doing interviews in Turkey.
The UNHCR first selects people who are particularly vulnerable.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered particularly vulnerable in refugee camps, such as single parents, disabled and sick people, women and children.
More people will be selected for the group coming to Finland than there are in the quota, because in practice some will not arrive for different reasons.
He also meets with non-governmental organisations operating on the Turkish Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu and on the Syrian border.
Ilkka Salmi, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior, is also on the way.
Speaking of increasing the quota
Finland has taken quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
The quota was 1 050 a year for a couple of years, but there has since been no agreement in the government to raise it.
The Coalition Party has been in favour of a quota increase, but the project has last fallen into blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (in the middle) recently proposed a gradual increase in the quota to between 1 500 and 2 000 people per year.
During this term of government, the silent visit is the first that the Minister for the Interior makes on the ground to monitor the choice of quota refugees.
The previous Home Affairs Ministers, Petteri Orphano (Econ.) and Paula Risikko (Econ.), were able to move on to their new duties before the visits could be arranged.
Finland receives €10,000 from the EU for each particularly vulnerable refugee.
Now we're gonna go off the hook... and we don't know if we're gonna cry or laugh anymore.
Last Saturday the Karelian reported on a bill to amend the Animal Protection Act.
The article gave the impression that the draft law basically prohibits the keeping of all animals which are not specifically permitted by ministerial decrees as production animals, pets or otherwise in the context of business activities.
In other words, all other animals, except those specifically mentioned in the Regulation, are prohibited in principle.
If the draft law is to become law, it is probably to say that we are rejecting the general principle in Western democracies that the law specifically prohibits activities that endanger the safety of society or good manners.
In principle, a ban on any activity which is not specifically authorised by law or regulation is now being imposed.
This change will mean that nothing new can be tried, for example in business activities, and nothing else can be done until the law or regulation that approves it has been adopted.
In general, the government's legislative work has been weak.
Now, if you go on the road that basically everything in Finland is forbidden, which is not separately permitted, you no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I have no doubt that the Animal Protection Act will require an update.
But the law project in this direction is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but I wonder if it will approve such a 'everything is forbidden, which is not permitted by law or regulation'.
Hopefully, there will be a sensible minister who will stop such a legislative project from progressing.

The Zorba storm in Greece on Saturday is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
On Saturday, meteorologists particularly warned sailors, fishermen and farmers on the west coast of the country about the storm in Greece, writes CNN Türk.
The tropical storm is reported to migrate along the coast from south to north during the day.

Kimi Räikkönen crystallized the reason for Mercedes' superiority over Ferrari
Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen was allowed to admit that the worst competitor Mercedes was too hard on the times of the Russian Gp.
However, there is no reason to sink into panic in the Ferrari camp, an experienced driver estimates.
They were just faster than us, but nothing huge is going on.
Our car was best on time all weekend, but they were just too fast, fourthly driven and with their teammate Sebastian Vettel, Räikkönen said clearly out of Mercedes speed.
Ferrari had a hard time in the last race in Singapore.
He was asked why he suddenly fell off the Mercedes.
Looks like they're going faster than we are... so simple it is.
If I knew why, we'd probably go as fast as they did.
But I don't know any more than anyone.
This is always speculation, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In time, a rare treat was seen for Räikkönen's future stable Sauber.
Next season, Charles Leclerc, replacing Ferrari with Räikkönen, was the seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also reached the last time session.
For a Swedish driver, the 10th is the best place to go in over three years.
And even though in the second driving session no fewer than five drivers did not drive completely, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging Räikkönen with a view to the future?
Yes, if you compare them to where they were from the beginning, then the step forward has been a big one.
There's a different story next year, so let's see, let's see.
That's it - Robert Helenius knocked out Erkka Teper: "Robbe is back"
Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper's match in Stuttgart's evening progressed on a level basis.
The German was a more proactive party in the ring, but he couldn't get a good hit.
Clearly, Helenius, more extensive, controls the match with his tough series, which found their way there.
The Finn was also clearly in better physical condition than Teper.
The solution finally came in the eighth round when Helenius knocked out Teper on his left hand.
The hit was so hard that the guy who fought in front of the home crowd didn't even try to get out of the carpet.
After the victory was confirmed, Helenius was quite moderate in airing.
At first he praised the good atmosphere and opponents created by the audience.
Then for a moment he changed his Finnish language.
Thank you to all viewers and Finnish incentives.
We brought the belt with us today.
Helenius rejoiced right after the fight.
It was a really big victory for Helenius' career.
There might even be a chance of a World Cup match," Helenius commented to Evening Magazine before the match.
Instead, defeat could have ended the entire boxing career.
Of course it's crossed my mind.
This doesn't get any younger, 34-year-old Helenius admitted before he met Teper.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster could multiply
According to The Guardian magazine, the vice president of the country calls for a clear increase in the number of victims.
According to Earth Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims could reach thousands.
Difficult circumstances
Saviors are looking for trapped people and also for dead people in the worst affected areas of the island of Sulawes: the port city of Palu and its neighboring county of Donggala.
So far, all the victims are from Palus, there is no clarity as to the situation in Donggala.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 are badly injured.
There are still people in the fallen buildings that the rescuers have not been able to get out.
For example, a hotel called Roa Roa in Palu has collapsed.
Saviors report hearing the screams of people trapped in ruins, but the lack of equipment for clearing has delayed the start of the rescue work.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has assigned an army to rescue and clean up.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, as electricity and communications are out of place in the disaster area in many places.
Fuel reserves are also running out.
Miss Finland finalist's hesitant response and long reflection caused a laughing hole
A new Miss Finland is currently being selected in Billnäs Ruuki.
A question was asked to each Miss Finalist during the interview round.
The finalists drew a question about the glass bowl on the stage.
Especially the finalist of the number six Emilia Anttikoski, 23, a hesitant response made the audience there sweet but benevolent laughter.
The question to Anttikoski had come through Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what is the latest book that the Miss Finalist has read.
Anttikoski thought about his answer for a good time before starting with hesitation.
Thank you for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read is... Anttikoski said, thinking.
The recess of thought in the audience was a laughingstock until Anttikoski continued his answer:
The last book I've read is...
I've read books in school!
Probably something to do with economics.
So the last book I've read is someone in economics, Anttikoski answered.
After his reply, Anttikoski received a shouting applause from the audience, accompanied by laughing.
In the past, on the Miss Tour, Anttikoski attracted attention because he did not want to pose in lingerie because of his principle.
The 2018 Miss Finland will be crowned at 9 p.m. when last year's Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm gives up the crown.
Sike's apple pear cake takes the tongue away
This recipe is for you who have good, sour apples from your own back, because the domestic apple is at a shocking price in the shop.
A pear may have to be bought, even though quite a few people are already growing that pear tree.
This cake can also only be made from apples if you do not want to buy pear.
Of course, the flavor is more versatile if the pear is also invested in the cake.
Peel the apples and the pear and remove the seed homes.
Cut.
Melt the butter in the pot.
Whip the eggs and sugar into foam and then add corn flour and melt to the foam.
Combine corn starch, i.e. maizena, baking powder and add them to the dough.
Add almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Line the bread dish with baking paper, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the dish and spread pear slices on the sugar.
Spoon half the dough over the pear slices and the apple lobes over the dough.
Spoon the rest of the dough over the apple lobes.
Cook in the oven at 180 degrees Fahrenheit for about an hour until the surface is beautifully brown.
Let it cool in the pan and then cancel the tray.
Just cut the cake when it's really cold.
The cake is fragile in structure and crumbles easily because the dough contains almond and corn flour without gluten.
Ruka will host an International Criminal Literature Event in January

Status symbols don't attract friends - Four facts of popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic, or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney have outlined two slightly different types of "coolity": generally attractive coolness and the opposite dissident-coolity.
Charmingly cool people, according to the researchers ' description, had many socially desirable features: outward orientation, kindness, agreement, and competence.
Dissidents, on the other hand, were characterised by distance, independence, rebellion and edge.
They thirsted for experience and gave little thought to external evaluations.
Both types were combined with good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of hardis is not cool in the long run: high status in teenagers does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
A US study published in 2014 in Child Development reports this.
Young people who dated early, partyed, sought out good - looking crowds, and sought popularity with others, had an increased risk of substance abuse and delinquency as young adults.
In their relationships, they were less successful than their once less discerning peers.
High-stating lock trucks, badges or bells do not make a person cool - or at least not genuinely attractive company.
In a study published in Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, the majority of people were more prepared to make friends with their usual market shirt than with those wearing a brand shirt - despite the fact that most people chose to wear a brand shirt in the context of their introduction.
If you are in Greece's holiday islands, watch out!
There's a hurricane hitting it. Weather alert is screaming red.
During the weekend, southern Greece can rain as much water as Finland averaged over six months.
The storm of Zorbas hits Greece during the weekend.
Be prepared for it if you are in the area of Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Kyclaads or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens announces it on its Facebook website.
According to the High Embassy, the Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red weather warning to the regions.
The approaching storm is also reported on the weather service in Foreca's blog.
According to it, the storm's strongest gusts are up to 45 meters per second.
By comparison, the Kuisma storm that beat Finland from the beginning of the week blew at its hardest in more than 31 metres per second.
According to the blog, however, the main concern of storm Zorbas is not wind, but heavy rains.
Over 300 millimeters of water can come on weekends in southern Greece.
It corresponds to approximately half of Finland's annual rainfall.
Weather Service Severe Weather Europa has distributed a video of the storm's development on its Facebook page.
Earlier this week, storm Zorbas has caused floods in Tunisia and Libya.
Do you recognize the drooling man Love Island English Anku?
Appears in confusing Youtube videos
Few people know that the beautiful Anku drooled by several men in the Love Island Finland series will also perform on strange Youtube videos published in 2010.
With videos Anku advises craftsmen to prepare an octopus from an old roll of paperwork.
Anku also shows her sympathetic style how you can conceive a hedgehog with the right spikes.
Now let's make Easter weeds grow, but let's do it a little surprisingly, Anku insinuates and introduces sawdust, stockings and seeds of fresh grass that he makes a hedgehog out of.
You can watch videos from below or from Anku's Youtube channel here.
Valtteri Bottas shook and burst adrenaline in Sochi - will he be helping Hamilton on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas shook a little bit more than ten minutes after his Russian gp pole drive when he was in front of the media.
A fine round left behind Mercedes' number one star Lewis Hamilton and was certainly a spiritually important criticism of the Finnish time this season.
Nice tour.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he dropped out of the rounds.
Feels good, I'm still shaking a little bit, Bottas figured it out.
I have only been on the stake once this year in Austria (midsummer), so time has passed quite a bit.
This track has been good for me before, and I got good spins again.
It's not easy to skip the Sochi track, so leaving is a particularly big part.
And, of course, Bottas had to answer the question of whether he was going to win tomorrow or whether he was going to help Hamilton, who was approaching the World Championship title.
My starting point for the race is definitely that I'm trying to win.
When you leave the stake, there can be no other goal, Bottas piled.
But as a stable, we fight for both championships.
Lewis's lead to Sebastian Vettel is pretty big and the difference between me is very big, so you have to keep that in mind.
Let's see what happens, but Bottas completed it.
After the drive, Hamilton was truly delighted with the success of Bottas, and the team boss of Mercedes, Toto Wolff, had a taste.
Lewis was gonna beat Valtteri, but he didn't make it on the 7th Street.
Valtteri knows he's gonna have to rip everything out of himself to win Lewis.
And he was so charged that the adrenaline burst out of his ears, Wolff glowed.
To the question of whether the stable allows Bottas and Hamilton to drive uprightly, Wolff replied with dodge.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
Kiitelainen Erno Kinnunen won the Finnish Rally Championship
The Finnish Rally Championship series ended rarely.
Hardly before before have the brothers become Finnish champions at the same time.
Now it was done by Tusulians Eerik and Henrik Peterinen in the final rally around Turku and Salo, as Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2.
Kiiteläinen Erno Kinnunen confirmed the best achievement of his career when the third place of the final competition sealed him the Finnish championship of two-wheeled cars from the SM4.
Kinnunen and Ville Mäkelä, who competed with Honda Civic, started Turku with moderation because the starting points were clear: the ranking in the top group would guarantee the Finnish Championship title.
In the darkness of Friday night, the duo had to compensate for some of the extra lights cheating on another special experiment.
That's where you got the third piece blinded.
In a situation like that, you don't need to get sloppy.
On Saturday, only Jussi Tepo, who was in the second series, was followed," Kinnunen said.
Syria urges the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops.
The Syrian Foreign Minister urges the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Mr Muallem, who spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, says that foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and unconditionally.
Muallem said that foreign troops are in Syria fighting terrorism, and the war against terrorists is "almost over."
In his UN speech, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
However, there is no end to the seven years of war.
Over 360,000 people have died in the war.
Chancellor Merkel said on Friday in Germany that a meeting was planned for October with the presidents of France, Russia and Turkey.
Not exactly Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court judge drama on TV.
Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of being harassed, took exceptionally many people to the courts.
In the United States, a high - power high - court appointment drama attracted at least 20 million people on Thursday.
At that time, Kavanaugh, appointed by Donald Trump, and California professor Blasey Ford, who accused him of being harassed, were before the Senate Legal Committee to tell his story.
According to preliminary results, the consultations were followed by a total of 20.4 million viewers on six main channels: ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
In addition to them, several millions more were followed online.
NBC reported that the live stream was followed by 6.8 million people and CNN reported a record of 8.2 million live broadcasts.
CNN will increase by more than 10 million, including those who have followed the broadcast via Youtube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also made 8.0 million start-ups.
Digital start-ups are the channels' own, TV viewer numbers are from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen will publish the final readings on Monday, but they will be dizzy anyway.
Not many people reach 20 million.
In the United States, over 20 million admissions are usually limited to sports matches and the great Oscar and Grammy Games in the entertainment world, as well as occasional political events such as Presidential speeches and presidential debates in 2016.
Of course, it's a trip to the American Football League finale at the Super Bowl.
This year, Super Bowl gathered around 103 million people on NBC.
Last year, according to Nielsen, Trump's first speech to Congress was attended by nearly 48 million people and inauguration by more than 30 million people.
It's a very important issue.
The appointment of a judge of the Supreme Court is an extremely important case in the United States, since the posts are for life.
Trump was already able to appoint one new judge when Antonin Scalia died early in 2016 and the Republicans managed to prevent President Barack Obama from appointing a successor.
The second place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but he was the so-called balance language on a number of issues, whose voice could determine the position of the nine-person court.
She was a supporter of abortion and sexual minorities' rights and, for example, in 2015 decided with her voice that the same sex rights were granted throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is far more conservative in his position.
His election to the Supreme Court may lock up the court for decades of conservative superiority.
Children have the right to receive their information to parents
Only parents of children under 10 years of age can see the health information of their children in the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
Originally, of course, the situation in the Kanta service was even more worrying: parents could not even look at the baby's health records or recipes.
A temporary correction was introduced in autumn 2016 for persons under 10 years of age.
Since then, practices have been promised to be corrected, but it has taken an amazingly long time to correct.
Now we're gonna fix it... in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, changing the legal basis should not have been more than a screaming case.
Then the layman's understanding is the push of the button: now that the wire is closed, open it.
Of course, a child can show his or her parents his or her information if he or she has bank credentials or an official ID card.
But how many 10-year-olds do they have?
The ID card is subject to a fee, and a 10-year-old doesn't even get bank IDs.
In practice, then, you cannot see the information of the fourth grader in primary school unless you ask for it printed.
This is not about parents' rights as it is about children's rights.
It is extremely important for the child's care that parents can be involved.
Of course, the right of teenagers to privacy must be taken care of.
Even minors can have family situations where not all things can be freely discussed.
Often they are related to sexual health, which is deeply relevant to human rights.
In the United States, the FBI began to cancel charges of harassment against Kavanaugh.
According to American media, the FBI is investigating allegations of harassment by at least two women.
One of the women was before the Senate's Legal Committee earlier this week.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations of alleged sexual harassment during his studies.
President Donald Trump of the United States ordered the FBI to investigate allegations at the request of the Senate's Legal Committee.
The report shall not take more than one week.
According to Washington Post, this is a more limited investigation than the criminal investigation, and it does not necessarily become public.
He threatened to kill cops at a police station in Kajaani.
The apprehended brawler continued his squabbling at the precinct.
Police say they've put a man in a police prison... to calm down.
The police were threatened by a suspected assaulter on Saturday night in Kajaani.
It's official to report an incident that started when a man with a 30-by-fifty was facing a violent fight at a restaurant in the city centre.
First, he assaulted another client inside the nutrition store.
This resulted in the removal of the restaurant.
Outside, the fighter attacked another man by pouring him down.
When the third party tried to get in the way, he hit her too.
Three assaults led to a police call.
The patrol grabbed the man and took Kajaani to the police station, the police say.
The suspect was still aggressive at the police station.
He kicked another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill and assault the police.
The police say they've sent him to a police prison to calm down.
He's a suspect in three assaults and a violent assault on an official.
Aid organisations are preparing to start work at the Indonesian Sulawes - "The cleanest water is the most urgent"
UN Children's Organisation UNICEF and other international relief organisations are ready to help on the island of Sulawes in Indonesia," says Kirsi Haru, Finnish Unicef's Information Manager.
The local authorities are in charge of rescue work, but the need for further assistance is already evident at this stage.
UNICEF operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal activity, UNICEF always has full emergency preparedness," says Haru.
The first task now is to find the people in the ruins, both the survivors and the dead.
In the city of Palu, Sulawes, rescue operations are underway, but in the Donggala area a little further north, the situation is less clear.
There are still places where connections are not working.
The aid measures are difficult because the roads are also cut off," says Haru.
The buildings are often lightly constructed in Sulawes, so the devastation caused by the earthquake and the tsunami is great.
When survivors are found, they need shelter - first, for example, tents - and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
First of all, people can most often offer water purification tablets, which UNICEF also has in store.
The aim is to repair the water systems as soon as possible, but in the event of an emergency, water is transported in trucks, for example.
In times of crisis, many children are separated from their parents.
Finding family members and family reunification is one part of UNICEF's mission.
Food aid is organised, for example, by the World Food Programme (WFP), which is part of the UN.
In the initial phase, funds previously collected will be used for emergency aid.
However, UNICEF, among other things, has already started raising funds to help the victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami.
Billionaire Elon Musk, as Chairman of Tesla's Board of Directors, closes a $20 million fine on Tweets.
Elon Musk, founder of space rockets and electric cars companies, avoids fraud charges by contract with the US Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk will terminate his duties as Chairman of Tesla's Board of Directors and accept fines of $20 million.
Musk resigns as part of the agreement he entered into with the US Securities Market Supervisory Authority.
By agreeing with Musk to avoid fraud charges.
The US Securities Commission, the SEC, threatened Musk for securities fraud because of the tweets he sent in August.
In them Musk wrote that he was preparing to withdraw the electric car company Tesla from the stock market, which caused the company's stock price to rise rapidly.
According to the agreement, Musk is not allowed to chair Tesla's board for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new "independent member" to its government and include two "independent directors" in its management team.
Tesla must also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communication.
Musk is still the CEO of Tesla.
In addition to Musk's personal fines of $20 million, Tesla also has to pay the corresponding fines of $20 million to the financial controller.
Tweets misled investors
According to the SEC, Musk's tweets misled investors and Tesla's shareholders.
Musk claimed that he would have secured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange as a private limited company.
According to billionaire's tweets, the company would have been bought off the stock market at $420.
Tesla's share price increased by more than ten per cent after tweets per day, but fell later.
According to the SEC, there was no basis for Musk's claims.
According to the overseer, he had not really negotiated the funding he claimed.
He had also not discussed the withdrawal from the stock exchange with the other management group or the board of directors of the company.
On Friday this week, the exchange rate dropped by 14% when the security administrator, SEC, reported a fraud charge.
An agreement on the news is expected to reconfirm the company's course.
The final judgment is not the reason
Of course, the bells of the cathedral do not ring when the hands do not move.
It's a technical glitch.
The clock at the Cathedral in Helsinki has stopped.
The wise guys are pointing at 12:00.
The situation is like a mediocre horror movie: while the church crypt was still an exorcism and the organ would be choking on its own.
Of course, this is not the case; the clock has stopped for technical reasons: it has broken.
It has been visited by a repairman, but some parts have been broken and a new part is expected," says Suntio Eveliina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the point already mentioned by Kirkko in Helsinki -Twitter account.
The account states that the final judgment is not the reason for the clock's stopping.
Jamsen tells me the church bells aren't ringing because of the glitch.
