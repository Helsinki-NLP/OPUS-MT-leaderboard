A 28-year-old chef was found dead in a mall in San Francisco.
Recently moved to San Francisco, a 28-year-old chef was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping center this week.
But the victim's brother says he doesn't know anyone who wanted to hurt him and says, "His business finally went well."
The body found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco Frank Galicia, said the San Francisco M.E.'s office.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was defined as a homicide and that an investigation was ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABC channel KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a line cook in Boston, had been given his dream job six months ago as a bustling chef at the San Francisco Sons & Daughters Restaurant.
Sons & Daughters' representative said they were "disturbed and shocked" because of his death.
"We have a small team that works like a close family, and he will be sorely missed," said the representative.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank stayed at the hostels at first, but that recently "his affairs were finally going well."
"She found an apartment and dated a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was benevolent and had a great heart.
His way of feeling united with the family was to cook for us, make dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to be a part of any dispute.
He was a brother who drifted along with the river.
"In a world where so many things are wrong, he was a rough diamond that shone brighter every day," he said.
Anyone who has information is asked to call the San Francisco Police hotline number 415-575-4444.
Medical interns on strike: Requirements for new work combat measures
Representatives of doctors' trainees have asked their trade union to adopt new work-fighting measures in their dispute regarding the new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) invites the whole Council to support new collective action measures from the beginning of September.
JDC says that ministers have failed to address concerns regarding the agreement.
In July, doctors' interns and medical students voted to reject the agreement that had been agreed with BMA.
58% of the votes cast rejected it.
In his letter to Members via Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC President Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained "insistently silent" on the issues which, according to him, led to the rejection of the agreement.
He said: "In this light, the JDC government has voted to completely reject the proposed new agreement and to call for formal negotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Government has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to obtain a mandate for the progressive and expanding work-fighting programme beginning early in September.
The dispute has resulted in doctors' trainees participating in six strikes this year, including the first complete work stoppage in the history of the NHS health system.
The director of BMA's interns, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned after the vote had been rejected, the terms recommended by BMA.
He had told BMA members at meetings before the vote of 54 000 doctors and students that the agreement was good and should be approved.
After the vote, Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the agreement would be imposed on doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an external consortium?
A gesture that ended in a crisis.
On Tuesday, the leaders of Russia and Turkey met to shake hands and declare the eight-month battle between words and economic sanctions officially closed.
But as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the gold-plated hall of Peter's palace, I had the clear impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
Yeah, we shook hands at the party.
But Putin's smile looked forced, and he didn't have much heat, even according to his own controlled standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, kept talking about his "love friend" Putin - five times according to a report.
I lost count.
He also swore that relations with Russia would return not only to pre-crisis levels, but even to better ones.
The next day the newspapers here described Erdogan's behavior as if nothing bad ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm reflected the opposite.
But the coolness of Putin showed that the Russian leader has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction back then was furious.
Putin attacked Ankara for stabbing Moscow in the back.
The insult was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The opinion of the Russian public has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media led an amazing, thorough attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were guilty of everything.
The most serious were the accusations made by senior officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from the illegal oil trade in the Syrian regions dominated by Isisi.
He has strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received his apology from President Erdogan.
Russia won some kind of victory.
The benefits of settling a truce are clear for a severer.
First of all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost out of power in the failed coup last month.
He has also been clearly shaken by the continuing terrorist attacks in Turkey.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia's economic sanctions have been heavy, in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has fallen by nearly 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, local tour operators and charter airlines will certainly be relieved as flights eventually continue.
They're hoping for a late season rush to the Mediterranean Sea.
And already this week, state TV has predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables since agricultural imports from Turkey were allowed again.
"Turn in there, get the tomatoes back here," as the Vedemosti report put it.
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
In a severe situation, we are angry at the West for what is considered a weak response to an attempted coup.
Adding to it a long-standing resentment about the EU accession negotiations that have been taking place at the speed of the snail, Mr Putin, who is eager to take advantage of the coolness and to break Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly got points off Ankara, where he called after the revolutionary attempt to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is clear to Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of a change of power.
So this meeting in the gorgeous seafront latrine enabled Russia and Turkey to present a 'external alliance', as one analyst described for me: two countries that feel abandoned by the West and mistreated them, bringing together their forces.
These two, however, have major differences despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently adapted itself to the role of peacemaker, but Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
After almost three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even dealt with the matter.
The Turkish President deliberately avoided answering their disagreements on this issue, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can look for a common basis for Syria.
After months of open hostility, and given the possibility of a complete disaster when a NATO member shoots down a Russian combat aircraft, it is certainly better that two leaders are speaking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland
According to the bank's CEO, the RBS brand will be reduced to a back office role.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was related to the Bank's international goals.
Since the bank almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued, it has abandoned these goals.
The bank's strategists have spent this time using the "RBS' brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds spent on international sport sponsorship from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon Master Andy Murray.
But it has now been considered right to allow more national brands to come to the fore.
Royal Bank of Scotland is used with Scottish customers, but it will not be restarted.
In England and Wales, all RBS references with the exception of the head office and stock exchange listings are converted into NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use by customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller private banking brands that gain more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed on a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand becomes the employer of our investor brand and employees because we now become a much more brand bank."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global targets; we have local targets.
Each of these brands means something very different in its own communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor Six Nations and has raised the profile of different brands in its sport sponsorship.
"It is now time for us to move towards the bank of brands, because basically (we have asked questions) it is about how we can focus on making this a better bank for our customers," said the CEO.
Three years ago I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we've done focused on customer needs, not on our own, I think you'll see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins in Newmarket with Prediction and wins 3,000 wins
Dettori sprays champagne after a double win he has a total of 3,000 wins
Racer Frankie Dettori confirmed his 3,000th British victory in Newmarket on Friday.
He reached the milestone with his second victory at his home course, competing with the Prediction coached by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in racing.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time master jockey Dettori, who won earlier at the Ghayyar, said, "This is special."
I'm very emotional because my family's here too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket because here I started 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's a normal Friday night and 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
Dettori sucks on himself cheering when he brings the Prediction out after the victory.
Two racers have reached this milestone in the obstacle races - Masterjockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4300 victories in his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggot, nine-time Derby winner, 4493 wins.
Frankie is one of the best riders of the present era, and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.
He's elegant and strong, but his tactical wit separates him from the others in the weighing room.
He's a great ambassador to the races, his zeal and charisma have been pulling fans into the sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have ridden 6,000 winners if he weren't just a jockey for weekends and big races!
Seriously speaking, Frankie has ridden the winners in Great Britain for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He is a lively person who is a good thing for British competition, but in addition to that he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori was celebrating the milestone with a plane landing from the saddle.
From airplane killings to airplane landing, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British racing for two decades.
It's been a roller coaster.
A pile of profits in the big races, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' victory in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived the plane crash and suffered a non-compete on drugs.
Three years ago he had a hard time when he returned after six months of non-compete, but he showed remarkable strength when challenging skeptics and returning in his best condition.
And he may continue for a long time - Dettori has previously said that he would like to continue to compete until at least 50 years old.
Russian Putin dismisses Sergei Ivanov, Chief of Staff
President Vladimir Putin of Russia has suddenly fired Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
A 63-year-old has now been appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin statement stated that Putin had "ordered Ivanov to leave the post of President of the Russian Government," but there was no reason to do so.
Ivanov's Deputy Director since 2012, Anton Vuo, has been appointed as his successor.
Persecution, 44, former diplomat.
He was born in the capital of Estonia in Tallinn in 2012, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later he led the President's protocol and government staff, said on the Kremlin website (Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your confidence."
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your role as Head of State as regards the drafting of laws and the management of the implementation of your guidelines.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his place and recommended that Persecution be appointed to his place.
Are smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like Putin, served in the KGB for Soviet security.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on state television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff withdrew at his own request.
But despite smiling at the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So this is just the aftermath of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man once advertised as a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy has been received with great scepticism.
In his comments to Putin quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said "it is true that, early in 2012, I asked you in the debate to give me responsibility for this very complex task, if only to say a laborious one.
Well, now I've been Chief of Staff for four years and eight months."
Ivanov approved the mission in December 2011.
Former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB, as well as Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the State Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed Deputy Director.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after the second period of Puti, since the third period of Put would have been unconstitutional.
However, this mission went to another ally close to Putin, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister just three and a half years later before he returned to office.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson got kicked out of a producer.
Last month Gibson was involved in a physical dispute at a series set in Los Angeles.
A series of producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his dismissal in a joint opinion.
Special Agent Gibson, who played Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
There were creative differences and quarreling on the set.
I regret that it happened," he said in his statement.
According to the statement by ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how to remove Gibson's character from a series of FBI agents' team can be expected later.
A 54-year-old starring the Dharma & Greg sitcom has been in the series since its first season in 2005.
"I love the Criminal Minds series, and I have given it everything I can for the last twelve years," said Gibson in a statement published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that is not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, producers, actors, our incredible team and, above all, the best fans the show can have.
The beginning of the 12th production period of the series is scheduled for September 28.
The mystery fish ended up in a garden in Banff.
A man in Banff has asked for help to identify the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be wind fish left behind by a whirlpool of water.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the sea, published film material in Periscope, hoping that someone could bring clarity to the appearance of two - inch - long fish.
Queensferry Crossing Overpass: The bridge now extends to Fife
The 1,35 billion £ project is now expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected Queensferry's overpass to the north deck and the land bridge, which means the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of four brackets between the "decks" that are now about to be completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 rope ropes.
The 1,35 billion £ project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from country to bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Overpass.
We are all witnessing really impressive engineering work in this project, which has used over 30 000 tonnes of concrete and steel alone to build this section of the bridge."
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the barrier between the bridge and the bridge deck is a demanding operation in which extremely precise dimensions must fit together.
All in all, almost 79% of the bridge deck is now in place and the last piece of concrete deck is cast today in Rosyth, which means that the whole deck is ready to be put on the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: "The first barrier in any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this barrier represents the cutting edge of construction technology.
After the last section of the road deck had been installed and combined with the expanding road cover of the northern column, we then had to close the remaining section of the north, i.e. the inland side.
This was done by pulling the north fairway bridge 700 millimeters southward.
This was a huge and, at the same time, very demanding measure.
Huge because of the length of the land bridge of 222 meters, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled at an angle of slope of about 3%.
It is necessary, because the permitted measurement deviations according to which the team worked were tiny, just a few millimeters in each direction.
But I'm glad everything went well.
Salvation on Moelfre Bay: Three men are "lucky to be alive"
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after they fell off their fishing boat outside Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station alerted at 13.20 (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event developing in the Gulf of Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety as their boat continued on to its own.
"We saw the boat moving closer to the men and imagined the worst," said the helmsman Vince Jones of the Moelfre lifeboat.
"Fortunately, the strong wind had blew it away from them by the time we got started," he added.
The local fishing boat rescued two men, and the third man, 60 years old, was found exhausted hanging from the buoy without a life jacket.
The men were taken into the coastal rescue boat and brought back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said: "These three men in the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
There was a kill switch on the boat's engine, but it had somehow detached from the person who drove the boat when the boat crashed.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectable hunt for health and happiness
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
During the past decade, many have been worried that teenagers and children will no longer go out to play but rather spend their leisure time watching screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get off the couch and participate in some activity.
The screen time was originally limited to television, then video games and now recently smartphones.
So it is wonderful to see that technology and outdoor activity do not exclude one another.
I am, of course, referring to the fad called Pokémon Go. The app based on characters originally developed in the 1990s for video games (later they became a series of cartoons, playing cards and other sequels).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, its popularity was somewhat diluted before the release of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand early in July.
After that, the release of the game in other countries was delayed, as huge popularity overloaded the servers.
Only in days did Pokémon Go have more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
Then how does it work?
Explained in a nutshell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémons that are tracked by GPS, and can be "photographed" (through a phone hijacking) or "catch" after discovery.
The generation that played the game younger has joined the fad and jumped off the couch to join the search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the daily steps of the "average person."
The Apple Watch application Cardiogram, which follows 35 000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of the release of the game, the number of people moving within 30 minutes per day jumped from 45% to 53% in the users monitored by the Cardiogram.
The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Gota, it only sees training levels.
The admonitions of many public health campaigns to "find 30," "rise on the couch" and "be active every day" have not produced any results because most public health warnings are boring and caring people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
Regularly moving people have a lower risk of developing cancer or depression.
Activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure and diabetes, and its benefits are too many here to list.
The beauty of Pokémon Gon is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even make new friends when they hunt.
As usual, disapproving ruiners are looking for things to complain about.
Yes, someone can walk towards the door.
So?
There's been a breakthrough.
Although there were applications like Fitbit in the past that could monitor activity, they did not give reason to move in the same way as this game.
The ecstasy of newness disappears, and the use of it fades in time.
However, because of Pokémon's success, there will be other games that combine apps and virtual reality with the activity of the real world, helping many hunters to be more active, in better condition and healthier.

Simone Biles grabbed gold in a women's gymnastics multiplayer match.
Forget the pressure.
Forget the publicity.
Simone Biles is immune to all that.
Energetic jumps.
Smooth at the boom.
Unbelievable on the floor.
Excellent everywhere.
And now, in the end, the Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old American gymnast won the multiplayer championship on Thursday, leaving the gap between himself and the rest of the world in the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
His total score, 62.198, was clearly better than the Silver Medalist and Final Five teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the U.S. balanced boom at the finals of women's multiplayer gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
Partyes became the fourth American woman who has successively won the multiplayer championship and overall the fifth American champion. At the same time he strengthened his reputation as his generation, and perhaps the best of all time.
He burst into tears when his final point was announced, and his long journey toward this moment ended.
This achievement brings him into the same class with the other best athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their species to a new level:
For the past three years, Biles has dominated his species, winning 15 World Championships, including 10 gold, with programs so amazingly mixed with ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic Champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
The last test awaited Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and other competitors, but between him and the burden of overly high expectations.
Returning the family home to Texas Spring without a handful of gold medals would have been a disappointment.
Simone Biles of the United States, left, and Aly Raisman hug after winning the gold and silver medal (in this order) women's rack gymnastics multiplayer at the finals of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro on Thursday, elok.
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday when he was a culmination at the departure party of the retired national team coordinator, Martha Karolyin.
Even though Biles claimed that he never thought of the future as he went his long way to the top, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program - the one with his trademark's volt override - is adapted to Latin American music, which would also be ideal for the street next to the Rio Olympic arena.
This isn't a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, was found by Coach Aimee Boorman's mother when she was on a study trip to the gym where Boorman coached has become a power factor.
He hasn't lost in a multi-game since summer 2013, and this winning streak lasts as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafina was in a small position after two laps, it was just a delusion.
The balance bar and the floor, where Biles is the reigning world champion, waited.
He got to the top with a boom point of 15,433 and crossed them with 15.933 permanence.
Raisman hugged him benevolently as they waited for the final points - a mere formality - and tears rose to the glitter-red, white and blue eyes of Bales when the dream he once wrote in his scrapbook became true.
Raisman's performance was some kind of rematch from four years ago when he was in divided third place, but lost the bronze to Mustafina in rerun.
This time the 22-year-old team leader, whom the Americans call "grandmother," was clearly in charge.
He sent air kisses to the public after his permanence in emotional turmoil about a return that sometimes seemed questionable.
As far as Bales is concerned, this 19-year-old's widespread tweeting from earlier this week will have a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims of serial murder were shot while listening to music in the car.
The two women killed in the most deadly attack on the first serial killer case in Phoenix last decade and the 12-year-old girl sat in the car talking and listening to music when they were shot, as reported in a police release released on Thursday.
Authorities said that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, were shot in a car parked in the driveway on June 12th.
The press release reports that the shooter standing on the passenger's side of the car fired the handgun up to eight times and then fled with another vehicle.
According to the police, the triple kill doesn't seem to have been the result of a robbery, since the attacker didn't take purses or 2,900 dollars from another adult victim.
The Phoenix police representative, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that the shooting led the investigators to see if it was related to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people have died and two have been wounded in the nine attacks that took place over four months in two predominantly Latin - American districts.
"These are happening in the residential area in front of the home," Howard said earlier this month to the CBS subsidiary KPO.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, such as the brown Nissan in the late 1990s, the black BMW in the late 1990s and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Researchers have refused to disclose evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks are connected and are committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for injuries, where he died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
The eyewitness told the police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also issued a police report on the shooting, which took place only half an hour before the Trinity hit, targeting an empty pickup truck, which is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Scientists found bullet casings, bullets in the seat and bullet fragments in the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's gonna get easier."
Edmund Picciuto, like most of the other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But, unlike most of his peers, Edmund is small-headed. This is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know about when she was pregnant.
"When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for this.
Which is not at all true - of course I promised," he said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund may never learn to recognize them, and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that 'I didn't know people were still doing it'," Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with a walking rack.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
But he slowly reaches some milestones.
He walks with assistance and rides a bicycle.
He also loves playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth will show you how Edmund's came up with a sign sign for "Will you sing for me?"
"We'll teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not the usual sign language - he tells me Edmund has invented some of his own signs.
Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of causes: genetic infections, such as Edmund's case, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it affects the lives of people infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional load of an uncertain future.
I was just asking what was gonna happen.
What's gonna happen?
And he still doesn't really know.
In fact, I haven't asked for a prognosis in a long time, because I don't expect anyone to actually be able to give me one.
But Picciuto has hopeful counsel for mothers whose babies have birth defects due to Zika.
It's gonna get easier.
You can believe it's gonna get easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Rough rain and floods caused rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi
The heavy rain and widespread floods in Louisiana caused the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected for the state on Saturday.
National Weather Service reports that numerous rivers in south-east Louisiana and the southern Mississippi flooded over their banks and posed a major flood threat due to extreme rainfall.
Louisiana's governor, John Bel Edwards, said that state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and that aid is already coming to the districts that need it.
Mike Steele, representative of the Governor's Security and Emergency Response Office, said that they would receive requests for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that the Tangipaho County alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood guard is valid until Saturday in much of the south Louisiana.
Weather Service said in the statement that another three to five cents more rain is expected in the area.
In southern Alabama, the flood watch was in force on Friday as the rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs are both located in Louisiana and were predicted to set a peak flood record during the weekend.
Weather Adjuster Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood several houses in suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the threat was the flooding of the Ascension district down the river as the flooding rivers slowly descend into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River flowing south of the state of Mississippi in Liverpool, Lousia, was on the highest level ever at 9:00 a.m. on Friday morning.
Saviors are still picking people out of floodwater in Amite and Wilkinson counties in the southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and stepson were close to Glister on Friday.
62-year-old Hansford says that the water of Beaver Creek, normally over 400 feet from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
He says he was warned by another stepson living nearby.
"We woke up, and the water kept rising," Hansford said.
It went all the way to my waist.
Hansford's wife told her husband that she has not seen the water from the creek so high in the 48 years she has lived there.
Hansford said that both he and his family all had injuries and that he was the only swimmer.
Hansford said that rescue workers rescued a threesome in a large army-style truck and took them to Gloster's fire station, where the rescuers stayed on Friday.
Krautmann says that floods "spread rapidly" as heavy rains continue, and that authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says that an eyewitness near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the country was completely saturated by the heavy rain that had lasted since Wednesday.
The heavy rain and the flooding of the streets led to the rescue of Tangipaho County residents from their homes and the cancellation of lessons in five school districts, the authorities reported.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a member of the City Council at Tangipahoa said that 200 homes were flooded.
The residents had been evacuated to two churches, but both are now flooded.
The district chairman, Robby Miller, said that the authorities saved 72 people and 7 pets who had been caught by the rising tide.
Guards have been opened in the cities of Amiten and Hammond for those who have been evacuated.
"They get to go back to their homes when the water starts to go down," he said.
The city of Hammond, in the county of Tangipohoa, closed twenty streets due to the rising tide, and the inhabitants were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep the water out of their homes and movements.
"The last great flood here was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.
This is gonna be the same thing.
In Mississippi, the emergency director of Harrison County, Rupert Lacy, said that steady rain continued along the Gulf coast.
He said that on Thursday a handful of houses were reported to have flooded, but so far no floods have been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, director of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," Townson said, "and the rain continues."
The six-year-old Mahaj Brown survives the Philadelphia shooting.
Police report that a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which means shooting another six-year-old in town this week.
The child's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name was Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say that Brown suffered several gunshot wounds, including groin, leg, hand, and stomach, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets," the boy's grandmother, Delores Melendez, tells the station.
I can't believe it.
At the hospital, the boy's condition is recorded as critical and has undergone several operations.
The family will tell the station he's expected to recover.
The boy was about to start his first grade at the local primary school.
Brown was one of four shots in the Germantown Quarter.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-olds.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were stable according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car together with a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reported.
The other two victims weren't in the car, and the police are checking if one of the injured men could be the shooter.
Scientists are telling CBS Philadelphia that it seems there was a crossfire between several shooters.
The shell casings of the attack weapon, from various types of attack weapons, filled the scene.
It seems that this was definitely an ongoing battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
"So it looks like there were several armed fighters here and they were in active combat," said Philadelphia police chief Anthony Ginaldi to the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
There have been no arrests, and according to the information received, the police are investigating surveillance footage.
Another six - year - old, a girl, got hit by a stray bullet in her hand on Tuesday when she was playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighbourhood.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That is what I call this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been in every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second: This team includes three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of this team, complemented by the Jewish Aly Raisma and Catholic Madison Kocia, will make everyone proud.
This team looks, finally, like America.
It has also established the presence of black and Latin American women at the top of the species.
For the last four years, the most successful female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were the first and the second.
This is awesome.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised him as an Olympic winner, and America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who perform unexpected but masterful gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman who has consecutively won individual gold in women's polygamy.
And teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We can see the peak of the species, but this is not what the situation looks like in gymnasiums across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison when they reached the Olympic team.
They are the Final Five (the last five) because at the next Olympics there will be only four gymnastics players, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as a coach.
The reality is, however, that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnastics usually practice in private gymnastics clubs run by parents who pay for training, facilities, trips, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (coachers and their gymnastics and families) and the list continues.
Much of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburbs that can support the species.
At these clubs gymnastics receive all their training, and this is a costly and long - term commitment to gymnastics families.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles' coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez' coach, have both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to bring more affordable and available gymnastics training to communities where many young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie live.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15 000 young people in the city (mainly blacks and Latinos) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this remarkable Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develop the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, as well as the industriousness, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for good health and for success in school and work.
This team's inspiration makes thousands of young girls start gymnastics, and that's awesome.
Participation in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We live in an exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing serious "girlfriend power" by winning the Olympic team gold, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road to healthy, strong and successful young womenhood.
Doctor trainees organizing new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association staff, but 58% of the 37 000 doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July Hunt revealed plans to force the agreement, saying that the NHS was on "unknown ground" and that even minor further delays would harm staff and patients.
The first interns will be transferred to a new contract, which will include changes to the night and weekend working methods to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Medical Trainee Committee, said in a statement last night: "Doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, in particular that it accelerates the existing labour crisis and does not treat all doctors equally."
With only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new treaty, progress must be made and time is running out.
BMA's attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have faced a lack of willingness on the part of the government to participate and, at times, a deep silence.
This despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, remove the coercion and take into account the concerns of the doctors' trainees.
If he doesn't, the doctors will be ready to continue their work-fighting activities.
The latest strike at the end of April meant the postponement of nearly 13 000 routine surgery and 100,000 reception times when nurses and consulting doctors were recruited to replace doctors on strike watch.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over changes by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association staff.
BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54 000 doctors under contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of the NHS Employers' Association, appealed to the doctors interns not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: "Working struggles achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services that are already in a difficult situation and cause anxiety, anxiety and disturbance to patients, caretakers and their families."
Over the last two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of the Guardian Role and whistleblowing.
Employers were optimistic that a sustained positive debate on other important issues - such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for returnees from Sabbath leave, costs of education, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay gap in medicine - is a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health are about respect for the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
A medicine that pays two pounds a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from two pounds a day of a medicine that pays after the authorities recommended that it be given to humans for longer.
The anti-clotting medicine, ticagrelor, reduces the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
The medicine is given for 12 months after the heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or another attack.
NHS administrator NICE has advised that it should be given to humans for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS overseer NICE has advised that it should be given to humans for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year in England, and a quarter of these suffer a second stroke or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty material accumulated in the wall of the artery, which forms narrowing.
If the stenosis ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that blocks the blood flow to the heart causing a heart attack.
If the clot is released, it can go with the blood and cut the blood flow to the brain causing a stroke.
People who have already had one seizure have an increased risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the company AstraZeneca in Great Britain and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clotting less likely.
The draft NICE guidelines published today recommend that 90 mg ticagrelor be administered to humans for 12 months followed by 60 mg twice daily taken with aspirin for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "Without taking care of the availability of effective preventive treatments, up to a quarter of those who have a heart attack will later suffer a second heart attack or stroke, the consequences of which are often devastating."
Fear of renewal can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in calculating the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
When we first recommend ticagrelor, we are pleased to add the available treatment options to several thousand people who may benefit from them.
Since data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially as regards the risk of bleeding, are limited over a period of more than three years, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment longer than this period.
The culture of political correctness allows electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim regions
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year because of corruption, triggering a government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities has been ignored, is exposed today in a shocking government report.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles begged the police, election overseers and city councils for ignoring the evidence of electoral fraud due to "racial and religious hypersensitivity."
The former Secretary of the Community, the current Emperor of anti-corruption, said that the intimidation of voters on religious grounds is so serious that the police should be allowed to set up security chains outside the polling stations to protect the frightened voters.
He recommends that voters should present an identity card when voting to prove who they are.
Today, the electorate simply has to say its name and address.
The report even proposes putting indestructible ink on the finger of the voting person so that no one can vote twice.
The whistle-blowers should be better protected, Sir Eric says.
He calls on the press to have greater access to the Council's documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working parties.
"This would not only protect against electoral fraud but would protect local government from a wider culture of corruption and economic fraud, which goes hand in hand with electoral fraud," he said.
The government commissioned a report following the vote scandal at the Tower Hamlets in East London.
Last year, the Special Election Court decided that the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed as a result of numerous charges of corruption and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman 'c cynically distorted' the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamism.
Rachman is said to have "led his election campaign on the grounds that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were questionable or the result of a person voting as someone else.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern at the postal vote on electoral fraud, which said that members of the high-ranking Muslim community had pressured people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made a number of recommendations regarding the cleaning of the voting system, including proof of identity by identity certificate.
He says in his report: "The evidence was presented that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the wishes of the elders, especially in communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"There were concerns that...the state institutions had ignored such behaviour because of "politically correct" racial and religious hypersensitivity."
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals to clean up the system, including a ban on political activists being allowed to deal with post ballots in order to put an end to 'voice collection'.
The report which Mrs Theresa May is considering also calls for stricter checks on registered persons in order to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Consider options for proving the identity of voters before voting.
Use the finger of the person who votes for the indestructible ink so that no one can vote twice.
Perform systematic nationality checks to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
Set a limit of three years for requests for automatic mail voting.
Prevent political activists from processing the finished sounds and envelopes that are sent through the mail.
Let the police set up security chains around the polling stations.
Change the law so that it is easier to blame people for intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photography illegal at the polls.
Require that only English (except Wales) be used at the polling stations.
Strengthen training to ensure that the staff adheres to the rule that the electorate should go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric is gonna tape the police force in Great London saying it's "astounding" that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The electoral court stayed as a result of numerous acts of corruption and illegal conduct by Lutfur Rahman and his officials," he said.
He was found guilty on the basis of a number of criteria, without any doubt, according to the criminal evidence threshold.
He also criticised the ineffective "tick-to-box" checks in the voting offices of city councils.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's Tower Hamlets conviction was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a glorious legacy as the birthplace of parliaments, but this worrying and secretive spread of electoral fraud and the denial of the facts of certain groups threatens this good reputation."
Crazy for Kate's biker double and other celebrity pictures at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans at the Rio 2016 Olympics have gone crazy from French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be an impressive doppelganger of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who can boast about his own famous double - at least according to social media.
So in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces on our screens at the moment, FEMAI has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellison, member of the U.S. men's archery team, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's doppelganger on the bike track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the star Leonardo DiCaprio twin.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's archery team, has caused a storm on Twitter since she surfaced her pictures of her looking frighteningly like the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And in fact, when he became aware of the passion of social media, the archer admitted that he has heard since childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I don't see much resemblance, except maybe with a beard," Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will certainly emerge this year as well: the striking resemblance between Britain's long jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina, with her big, expressive eyes, has been said to be the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan's double.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared for years to Glee star Matthew Morrison.
Bigger gear for the eye: This user thinks Nathan is an inception actor's "sporty version"
Another long-term comparison has been a tennis star between Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, both with similar strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more than a tan skin and blonde hair with actress Annalynne McCord, while the US team Nathan Adrian is a fan of the "Joseph Gordon Levitt Sports version."
Hard Women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter, right, share a similar face and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Presentation of the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason between the couple's similarity
A Twitter user recently expressed his happiness on the site that "other people on the Internet think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And the American soccer star and Dexter's actress certainly have an incredibly similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to Laura Linney's smile, and the gold medal winner Gabby Douglas, whose own beautifully wide smile matches the smile of the Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
The CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying "dead like a pig" to a Chinese swimmer.
Byron MacDonald's analysis of women's 4x200 m free swim message, instead of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan, enraged the viewers of the CBC live Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
The Canadian television company CBC must have apologized after one of its reporters said during the race that a 14-year-old Chinese female swimmer "lost like a bad smell" and "dead like a pig."
Reporter Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began sharing some of his own opinions in the women's 4x200 meter free swim message final.
MacDonald, who came to the CBC reporting team to bring in "color," was heard to say, "That little 14-year-old from China screwed up, baby.
Too eager, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swim the message at the second part of 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canada to catch China.
Viewers from all over Canada react quickly online after shocking at the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'?
The idiot didn't realize he was still live."
China's Ai Yanhan was filmed in the women's free swim 4 x 200 meters final as follows: "That little 14-year-old China screwed up, baby."
Review against Byron MacDonald on Twitter was heavy and fast, with many challenging him.
Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how reckless Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like racist people.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who was hosting a CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's comment on live broadcast, saying: "We regret that the comment on the swim performance was broadcast.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we regret that this has happened."
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Scott Russell, the rapporteur, had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
The CBC then copied and attached an apology to over 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The TV company also quickly apologized and published a statement.
We deeply regret the fact that these statements were made and were sent live.
Last night we quickly took action and apologized to our viewers and followers on social media on live TV.
For the sake of clarity, it must be said that Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on live air and tried to define his comment by saying that he did not mean it as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologise in this moment for the comment I made last night after the message of women," he said in the CBC Olympic broadcast.
"I referred to the performance of a swimmer, not him as a person."
"It must be unnecessary to say that I did not mean it disrespectfully, and that I am truly sorry."
Primark's client stunned by a woman who impudently fitted underwear in the middle of the store.
Customers didn't know where to look when a woman undressed in the middle of Primark's shop to try her underwear.
After assessing what he looked like in his pants, the woman would peel them off and put them back on the shelf.
He continued to tour and finally fitted four pair of panties in a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
Primark's shop at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where the woman ate her panties and then put them back on the shelf.
At the same time, Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children in the store, said that after experimenting with lingerie, a mysterious woman "dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything."
He said, "People didn't believe their eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store floor, took a couple of the underwear she was wearing, took off her own stockings and underwear, and put on the ones she fit.
"He didn't even try to find a remote place for reconciliation, he just stood there shameless."
"Everyone was staring when he took off his underwear again and clearly didn't like it because he put them back on the shelf."
He did the same with three more couples before finally deciding that he didn't like anything he saw, got dressed again and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care who was watching or thinking about someone who would end up buying the underwear he was trying on."
Davidson, 33 years old in Kent City, said: "It is disgusting to think that someone is taking home underwear that someone else has tried but hasn't been cleaned."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I said that the staff apparently tried to remove the clothes from the sale after the woman left, which is all right."
"It would be terrible to go home with new underwear and find another woman wearing them and undressing them, and they have not been washed."
Primark's representative said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place in Folkestone's shop on Tuesday 9 August.
All the products in question have been withdrawn from sale'.
This way you can defend yourself against armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Krav Maga Federation Grand Master Rhon Mizrach in New York to find out how to handle gun-waving robbers in close range.
Whether you're approached from the front or the back, this video will show you how to pay the attacker the same way.
According to Mizrach, if you're approached from the back, the first thing you have to do is turn around so you can see your assailant and "screw the line of fire."
Then you grab the gun between your forearm and your shoulder before you punch the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Continue with your knees to the groin, and when the attacker goes out of pain to the curl, twist the gun out of his hands, hit him at the back of the gun to the face and back off, holding the gun directed at him.
If an armed person approaches from the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the gun and turn it around so that the criminal cannot trigger.
At the same time, put some weight on the gun and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun out of his grip, back off and point the gun at him.
Does that sound awkward?
Look on the video and see how Mizrachi exactly does this.
But remember, if you're not the Grand Master of Krav Maga, the safest way out of a robbery situation is to give up your money.
Tourist Ian Wright licks the dirtyest places in Europe for a travel guide
A British traveler has put a serious challenge on his immune system and vomiting reflex by licking some of Europe's filthiest and most disgusting places.
Suffolk-based host and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, would lick euro banknotes, handrails in Piccadilly Circus, a train toilet flush button and a Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used the photometric to show himself and us the situation he was about to face.
However, an experiment that was made on the trail of inner power produced surprising results.
The idea of licking the flush button of a train used by thousands of people may seem completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On his way across Europe, Wright kept talking to doctors and medical professionals about the strengthening of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of his arrows left anything else in his mouth of bad taste.
Wright became a well - known tester of the endurance of his bowels as he traveled around the world and ate strange and wonderful things.
This task from the rails of public railway stations to the toilet flush button actually tested his immune system.
In the movie he said: "Since childhood I have been quite carefree about my health, and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth since the dirt, worms and muddy water."
He certainly confirmed his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a filthy Russian public toilet.
His sample contained a reading of over 4,000 units in the photometer.
For comparison, the number of newly washed hands should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public toilet, he refused to lick when the photometric result showed more than 4,000 units, and the newly washed hands are less than 60.
Wright has produced a traveler's film with internal power, together with Finnish dairy, Valio. The film shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the movie, the wedding said, "This is almost the worst thing I've ever smelled in the bathroom."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting in here.
On the basis of internal power, the Finnish dairy, Valio, was produced together.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help to enhance people's intestinal bacteria and immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, director of snacks, juice and new categories, said: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at and at the same time explain the interests of the probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air and ended up with the idea of 'let's call Ian'.
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: to tell our everyday environment about good and bad bacteria, the importance of intestinal health and its connection with the immune system.
Growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we can interestingly share it with consumers.
In my opinion, the documentary also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, director of the documentary, added: "Let's put it this way: if Ian had licked some of the things I asked him for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the movie, I would have lost respect for him."
Understandably, some of the things that were licked were easier for Ian, while others were quite difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty licks saved."
In Valio's 2015 survey, 84% of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria specifically to the well-being of the stomach and intestines, while 58% said that they at least occasionally use products to which lactic acid bacteria have been added.
The bully family destroyed the rental house in Cornwall, Saltash, before the eviction.
The bully family caused £50,000 damage to their house after they were evicted because of the terrorisation of their neighbors.
Tanya Keldon and her partner, Shaun Trebilcock, have been thrown out of a property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a number of complaints.
After they had been removed from the property by force, shocked housing officials found that the property was in bad condition.
There were splashing holes in the walls, floorboards were torn up, garbage was spread on the floor and walls were smeared with graffiti.
The family has now moved and is believed to live in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, the manager of Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid the property couldn't be repaired.
He said: "This has been a nightmare for the inhabitants, and I do not think people should have to live like this.
There are a lot of things to consider here, because this property is likely to be known through the less comfortable groups in Cornwall.
This family is infamous, and their names are infamous."
The couple had three sons who sometimes lived in the property, and according to the police, the family tyranny involved street fighting with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug abuse, drug sales, and excessive shouting, quarreling and swearing.
In June, Skeldon, 47 years old, whose name was on the lease, received a decision on antisocial behaviour.
Many of the rooms in the house under threat of demolition found old waste.
The building where drugs were previously transmitted had floorboards pulled up.
Neighbors said that the family was seen fighting in the street and that the police were called regularly.
Cornwall Housing forcefully evicted a woman and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors thanked the eviction, saying that their lives had turned into hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next door to them for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We've seen the police in here so many times.
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
It's wonderful now that they're finally gone."
Adam Fitzpatrick, executive director of Cornwall Housing neighbourhood, said that the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often called to the property.
Garbage and old toys have been thrown down on the wild wall of the apartment building.
He added: "It is a pity that the resident did not take any responsibility for his own and his family's behavior, as eviction is always the last course of action considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, for behavior was extreme, and their actions must have terrified the neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, by the Devon and Cornwall police and by the courageous members of the community who have given us information.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to the neighbours and send out a message that antisocial behaviour will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys all lived in the property at different times, but they were all in their 20s.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one bedroom after the eviction
The workers of the housing company must now clean up the piles of garbage surrounding the house
In 2014, the police raided the property and found more than 70 g of cannabis and scales, supplies and 1700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was fined for pleading guilty to possession of a class B drug as an intention to pass it on.
He claimed that the money was meant for his son Lee Skeldon's tombstone, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her partner are homeless now staying in private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many walls of the house had graffiti smeared.
Police say they're trying to evict residents who mock the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall police said that eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who continued to mock the rules.
"This is a message to those who think that their behavior is without consequences, and to those who suffer from such behavior," he said.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior, and the police will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were terrified when a military jet flew along the shore at a low level
Sun - Worship Tourists in Aveiro, Portugal, suffered a shock in their lives
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force swept past very low
The Air Force said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised.
At this very moment, terrified tourists began to panic as a low - flying jet swept over a crowded beach.
The dramatic recording shows how a military aircraft came close to touching the sun worshipers on a sand strip in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The vacationers stood up as they began to understandably worry about the noise from the jet, even though they did not see at first what was coming from behind the clouds.
The incident took place in Costa Nova, near Aveiro, yesterday afternoon.
One of the numerous vacationers who published videos of a dramatic bypass in social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said: "It passed twice at a very low altitude, and in one place it seemed as if it was about to crash into the ground."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and really felt like a plane was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared out of the darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight designed to identify fishing boats near the coast and had to land so low that it was the only way to check the boats.
He said that the jet had flown much lower than usual because of the low visibility of smoke from nearby off - ground fires, but the Air Force assured that no one was in danger of safety.
This summer, the fires have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal and four people have died on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly due to low visibility conditions, smoke caused by off-road fires and thick fog.
The aeroplane was on a training flight and as part of the training, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats
The result of the first half of the year was better than expected
The Social and Health District of South Karelia (Eksote) scored EUR 3.4 million better than planned in January - June.
Eksote's profit was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has helped to dismantle institutional care.
The care guarantee was implemented in all activities.
This year, Eksote is trying to shorten the queues of measures.
Exote covers a deficit previously created with a surplus.
The excess may be used to shorten queues and buy measures for patients.
The result for the whole year is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Eksoten Board will discuss the six-monthly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special border guards swore a military oath in Immola
Seventy officers of the Border and Coast Guard School took a military oath on Friday.
The military oath was held in Immola on Friday.
The whale ceremony of the tenth special frontierist class was held on the garrison sports field.
The military vows were sworn by 70 armored men.
Special border hockey is trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied to become a special border guard.
250 of them were invited to the selection exams.
Special border guards have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans from the border forces during the war attended a veteran meeting during the ceremony.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans attending the event were born in 1918.
Pieselvuo ahead of bandits - criminal intelligence helps solve crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 Finnish police departments has been operated by the RTA, or criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The unit's activity is invisible from the outside.
At Häme Police Department, the unit consists of a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's being pulled by a Sergeant stationed in the Bay.
Lieutenant Lahti is the Chief Executive Officer.
In addition, the unit's strength includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in a civilian uniform.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity," says Deputy Commissioner Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides the rest of the police with various reports.
In Häme, it has acquired information about asylum seekers, among other things.
The latest reform of working methods
The establishment of analytical units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, that is to prevent the police from leaving the marshes until the alarm is alerted.
Using the data collected and analysed by the unit, daily police activities are targeted where they are most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, a criminal intelligence centre was set up in the country, less than three national units and their own criminal intelligence unit for each police department.
In Vantaa, the PTR centre operating in connection with the Central Criminal Police is running operations nationally.
PTR units work with police, customs and Border Guard personnel, as their name suggests.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas divided by police departments and have the task of providing information both to local police forces and to national services.
Intelligence extends beyond your own territory
While an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, it is up to RTA to know what is happening throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the borders of your institution, because so does crime.
People working in RTA have better computer skills than basic police.
Using registers, an alert function database and observations, the unit aims to draw police attention to new phenomena, productive criminal or similar crimes.
This is called serialisation and is one of the most important tools of criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, be it honest or criminal.
By the way it's done, it makes up a certain image.
It can be done either by the method or by the person depending on which police have more information.
Criminals Learn From their Mistakes
Workers in RTA do not walk the city with their collars up, but their work is not entirely public either.
The methods used by both criminals and criminals are not reported because they could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus trying to prevent police efforts to combat crime.
The police will publicly inform you if they anticipate a threat.
For example, such an incident was reported early in the summer, the method used in housebreaking to mark vacant dwellings.
In it, the authors put a stick, pin or a piece of tape on the front door of the apartment to see if the residents were really out of town.
The pre-trial material shall be made public at least to the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
For example, the smartest ones order the District Court minutes, which may indicate that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
Next time, we'll go to the thieves with gloves on.
An interview has been conducted with Deputy Commissioner Tero Seppä from Häme Police Department, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police Department, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärvi from Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police Department.
The police collect and analyse information to plan practical action.
Against this background, the reduction in labour and financing volumes.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was the three-stage PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects data from outside the borders of your institution and Finland.
A schoolgirl who joined the father was killed in Syria in London
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasname Akunjee said that the girl's family heard her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
On Thursday, ITV News reported that the girl was believed to have died in a Russian air strike on Raqqa, which is an organization base in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just as she was planning to escape from a war-torn country and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can serve as a tombstone and a will for others, that there are real risks of leaving the war zone - that it could cause people to give up making such a decision," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London schoolgirls flew to Turkey, from which they took a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she had married an Isis fighter in Syria and that she became a widow after just a few months.
Reid says Clinton's gonna think Garland's the Supreme Court candidate if he gets elected.
The Senate's democratic leader, Harry Reid, says that he is convinced that the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected president.
The Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Mitch McConnell, head of the Senate's majority, says that the next president will elect a late Supreme Court member to replace Anton Scalia.
On Thursday, during a conference call, Reid said that he predicted "some degree of certainty" Clinton would choose Garland.
Reid's representative later said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would appoint Garland and that it was speculation.
He complimented Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to rock the boat with a new choice.
Garland is in the district of District of Columbia, Chief Justice of the U.S. Court of Appeal.
Reid said that the Republicans who are blocking Garland's name are the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's "armies" and "prospectors."
He said Trump wasn't suitable for the job.
The treats say the nude calendar is "for women as well as for men"
The treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to publish the calendar inspired by Pirelli of the 1970s for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they're going to find the next top model generation in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Steve Shaw, president of the Treats, told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of naked pictures differs from the old school Playboy because "Playboy is for men" .
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is for them.
"We must begin to show off the timeless and classic nudity where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of naked female body," Shaw said in a press release in which the calendar was published.
Women want to be part of this project because it's beautiful art.
Models can leave photos online or personally open selections in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl destination: who really buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyls.
Before rushing to fill the comment section with irritated insults written by a nickname NoAll lonelyMen, notice that this claim is based on real information.
According to YouGov, the new coming of the much - spoken records is not because more and more people born this millennium are excited by the novelty of physical objects, but by the longing of middle age.
Apparently, those who have recently purchased vinyl disks are most likely to be between 45 and 54 years old.
In fact, in all likelihood, records are most likely to be purchased by 18-24 year-olds.
Nor is it just a question of collecting hobbies, but it has a sentimental meaning: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings inside (56% vs 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs 66%).
But are YouGov's results true?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit.
Let's take a closer look.
While soho's charm and dirt are slowly removed - hotels, chain restaurants and shops and office supplies are now filling buildings with previously independent shops - a handful of gorgeous specialized record stores remain.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop filming for a moment when I stand very close to different men in some of these shops trying to evaluate by observing their age and emotional temperament.
Glasgow Stuart, 55 followed by Sister Ray (count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (count: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in 20s), spends her afternoon in London because of a meeting, and touring shops to spend a few hours.
I'm gonna ask him if he's a collector.
"I guess I am," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These plates, which appear in the picture above (he sent a sample by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), cover his living room walls.
The reason for acquiring such a huge number of records and singles is partly the result of his disposable income: now he can buy records that he could not afford when they were first released and he can buy again those he sold when he was young and broke.
"Most of the material I bought is from the late '60s and early '70s, records released when there were 11 or 12, records I was probably a little young for," he says.
He agrees that record buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and adds: "I don't smoke or drink much.
This is my vice."
25-year-old Wez, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he encounters fit YouGov's profile.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by media enthusiasm, people who have heard that the albums have come back to fashion and who have become in need of buying back their old albums.
Based on the discussions I have had, people have got rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their CDs back," he says.
This may explain the increase in the number of vinyl awakenings of certain age groups.
But what about the alleged emotional meaning of the records?
In a shop like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores offer comforting communities to people of the same mind.
According to Wez, some older customers have been particularly injured by the local payment system.
Some vinyl fans can be overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to rely on the permanence of familiar disk covers; objects that awaken the memories of teenage lucky days.
"I think sometimes it can be about filling a hole or some kind of comfort that owning things creates," Wez says.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It's an easy way to fill your mind.
"We're like their social workers!" another employee suddenly said from the record stack.
The April ICM opinion poll revealed that almost 50% of the people who had bought the vinyl album in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, whereas 7% of those who buy vinyles do not have a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look gravely concerned to browse the pile of bossa nova collections.
This "prize" aspect of the wake-up call is something that Jonny, 42, who works for the Sounds of the Universe (the counter: three middle-aged men), has also noticed.
"Someone came in a while ago and said, 'I don't have a record player, but I want to buy Radiohead's album so we can put it on the shelf'," he says.
This is not a large proportion, but it is definitely happening.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
So not the parents, but the younger people, the late teenagers, who are just getting excited about it.
In Fop, where today there is almost a whole floor reserved for vinyles, there is a much more versatile audience when I arrive.
70-year-old couples, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the movements mentioned earlier - it is great to see Wild Beast's latest scapegoat and sex-filled pop and not improvisation jazz - it is great to see different customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it is difficult to prove the gnawing psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around the Fopp for a few minutes looking at different records for sale.
He's doing window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He tells me he doesn't make much money, so collecting records isn't really an option.
"It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music either by computer or by some other way, but the beauty of vinyl is"... she sighs in love.
"I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique."
My last stop is said to have awakened a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I'm trying to look like I'm looking at the jeans, I'm picking up a group of teenage girls gathering around the Polaroid cameras for a while before my father and daughter were thinking about buying Crosley's record player.
On the left there is a staircase with a wall covered with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records of any average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just decorations, and some are so high that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's purely "art vinyls."
But considering that even a little attention from these objects can mean more money for industry and send some customers to Soho's depths to get more, there is not much to complain about.
It comes as no surprise that the population that is more likely to have more time and money is also the one who spends most on luxury items such as vinyls.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov's results are accurate, at least in Soho's record stores, they do not rule out the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, in record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or office.
They certainly do not spend their Thursday mornings peeking around the record stores on Berwick Street, browsing through the records and avoiding the gaze of a creepy 30-year-old fake TV host, peeking over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holkeri is the longest living vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say that the ward has a longer life span than any other vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who researched the shark, says that the record is on a female who is believed to be aged between 272 and 512 years and is five meters long.
The French court rejects the application to dissolve the trades at Jungle refugee camp
The French court has rejected the request of the Calais authorities to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During the court hearing this week, the Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to dismantle altogether 72 temporary trades where people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hair surgery or sell tea for 50 cents (40 cents), or sell simple food for a few euros at temporary restaurants.
The Prefect's office in Calais argued that the sites should be dismantled because they represent a non-taxed parallel economy and because they represent a risk of fire and sanitation.
Humanitarian groups have told the Court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that free meals provided by a state-sponsored organisation and other groups do not provide enough food for the increasing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free meals for those who need them.
The Court of Justice in Lille ruled that there were no legal grounds for ousting 72 temporary traders, but said that the prefect's concern "was perfectly understandable'.
Judge Jean-François Mollar said that grocery stores, cafés and restaurants played a much greater role than just feeding people who live in "extremely uncertain conditions."
He said that the facilities offered peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under threat of demolition was the Jungle Book Kids' Cafe camp, which offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons and asylum advice to hundreds of vulnerable, isolated minors in the camp.
More than 170 000 people have signed an appeal to protect the children's café.
A letter to the Guardian said that closing the cafeteria "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old."
Two charitable organizations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in Jungle's camp has risen to 9,000 people - to a peak - since a sharp increase in the number of arrivals during the summer.
Food prices in Finland fall clearly faster than the EU average
Food prices in Finland are sharply reduced to the pleasure of consumers and to the trouble of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by nearly 5% in three years, while the average price in the EU countries has fallen by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become one per cent more expensive.
During the last three years, food prices have fallen to other countries in Finland most in those EU countries with the same wage level as in Finland.
In the UK alone, the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are based on an article published in the Tieto & Trendit blog by Statistics Finland's Development Manager Ilkka Lehtinen.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices relative to the overall development of consumer prices.
The latest data are from June of this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose strongly.
In 2013, prices shook close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," says Lehtinen.
Then came the turn, after which food has become cheaper year after year.
The price now weighs on Russia's ban on imports of food, which has stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
This is why the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and producer prices for agriculture have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term," says Lehtinen.
The increased price competition between industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
Large retail chains The S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For the consumer, price competition has been seen as spectacular advertising campaigns.
Finland is still not a place for cheap food, though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland from EU countries with a wage level similar to that of Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the reference countries had the same VAT rate, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with similar wages.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate was seven per cent in the comparator countries, only Germans and Dutch people would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to reach the old EU level in food prices, we must halve VAT to the EU average and continue to compete for prices," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that his VAT rate calculations are indicative.
School's not exactly the same anymore.
A person returning to school may find that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a guide according to which all Finnish schools are operated.
The schools decide the details themselves, but the plan shows the official goals.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from old ones in many ways.
Among other things, the study of fiction is abandoned, while schools begin to practice coding.
Swedish education starts at the latest in the sixth grade, and social studies start at the beginning of the fourth grade.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of pupils.
It used to be thought that the teacher teaches the students, but now everyone needs to be active and learn from each other.
This is an attempt to make schooling more interesting.
The world's longest vertebrate was found - an ice shark can live for up to 400 years
Even the known Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) does not reach sexual maturity until the age of 150.
It can live another 250 years after that, report a new study.
The figures make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in today's world.
In the animal kingdom, it is passed only by an Icelandic clam whose oldest known individual is scheduled to be 507.
The Greenland shark is swimming all over the North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are one of the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than males; they can grow up to more than five meters [5 m].
Since the rate of growth is slow, only about one inch per year, adult individuals have been forced to live for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He defined the age of adult ice sharks from 28 females caught in fishermen's fishing gear.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radio carbon timing of the eye lenses.
The average age of the tested sharks was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, 493 and 502 centimeter Amazons, were found to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Since it has been found in previous studies that females of sharks reach sexual maturity by more than four metres, researchers calculated that they were at that stage around 150 years of age.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann fired almost 300 people - no reduction in salesmen
Nearly 300 employees are dismissed from Stockmann, a department store company.
Co-operation companies in a company in difficulty ended at the beginning of August.
"Around 300 jobs will be reduced as a result of the negotiations, most of which will be made redundant," Stockmann explains in his press release.
It states that the number of sellers of department stores will not be reduced in order to avoid suffering from customer service.
In addition, approximately 80 employees in support activities are offered new jobs as sellers.
Stockmann's joint negotiations concerned about 3 000 employees.
At their start, the reduction was estimated to be about 380 employees.
The population reduction aims to achieve annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are due to take place in the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
In the background are Stockmann's difficulties in making the department store profitable.
Although the Group's adjusted operating result improved in the second quarter to EUR 11.1 million, the department store trade still loses.
According to Stockmann's Acting CEO Lauri Veijalainen, sales in department stores have not reached the company's targets.
"Personnel reductions are unfortunately necessary to ensure the positive operating result of Stockmann Retail in 2018," Veijalainen says in the press release.
The second quarter's improvement was particularly driven by the success of Lindex's clothing chain.
The chain achieved its best second quarter turnover and results ever.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
During the corresponding period last year, the total operating result of the Stockmann Group was 4.1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperatures below 20 degrees across the country
The low pressure center on the northern part of Finland keeps the weather rainy Friday," says Ilona Láng, the meteorologist of HS.
There will also be showers of rain in the central part of the country, but the southern part is pouty.
The temperature is no longer very high in the summer, since mercury is below 20 degrees in the whole country.
In the rainy areas of the north, 10-15 degrees.
Kenya's Athletics Team is shaken by a doping scandal - a strange explanation for the coach's rapture
Kenyan athletic coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Olympic Games in Rio after it turned out that Anzrah was an athlete on the national team's doping test.
News agency AP reported that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is a 800-metre star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of Kenya's national team leader, reported that Anzrah's identity was revealed after giving a sample of the surprise test as Rotich.
Doping officers came in and turned Anzrah's authorities in.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because he "did his crime against Kenya's national team."
He played as an athlete, gave me a urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour', Kip Kip, chairman of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, thundered at Reuters in turn.
Olympic athletics will start on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run immediately at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth in the World Championship last year and is in advance of Rio's favorite winners.
According to Reuters, the source inside the Kenyan athletic team claimed that Anzrah was using an athlete's accreditation card just to get free meals in the race village.
When the anti-doping officers met him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken to the test.
Coach didn't explain the situation to the officers because he was afraid of being exposed," the source told me.
Where is everybody?
Rio's Athletics Stadium is pummeling its emptiness
Where the hell is everybody?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium watching athletics.
In Rio, a battle for athletic medals began on Friday, but the world's top individuals were able to show off their skills to a disconcertingly empty audience.
On Friday, Rio organizers reported that only 58% of first day morning tickets and 65% of evening tickets have been sold.
There was another one four years ago in London, where the stadium bulged about cheering people.
The final tickets are already sold out in Rio.
The loss of spectators at the Rio Olympics has attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been seen in the spectators of rugby, paddling and horse riding.
When Brazil's medals Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in legendary Copacabana, the audience was only 70 percent full.
After the Brazilian duo, the Netherlands played against Russia, with only about 30 percent of the 12,000 spectators.
At least, the bad trade is explained by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with economic problems, is far from European and Asian tourists, and many of the Olympic sports are strange for the Brazilians who are used to football.
True, even the first match of the Brazilian football team could not fill the football stadium.
The event organizer Mario Andrada told us this weekend that 82 per cent of the tickets had been sold at the time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
"There's still 1.1 million left to sell," Andrada said, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets sold at the London Olympic Games, 8.2 million were sold, even though these tickets cost almost half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around EUR 9 to more than EUR 1 000 at the opening.
More than half of the tickets cost less than EUR 16.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit empty seats, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed because organizers need money and are trying to sell tickets until the last minute.
True, in Rio, organizers have issued 240 000 tickets to school children for less well-known species such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty spaces at Rio Stadium this morning.
Not even a beach volleyball on the sand of Copacaba has interested the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London 2012.
There were a lot of people in the galleries.
A New Way to Protect Nature - Get Right to Land
Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation through new means.
Founded last year, the Foundation acquires ecologically important natural areas.
Thereafter, private, companies and entities can use money to redeem holders' rights to land.
The Foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land area is virtually divided into blocks that those wishing to acquire in exchange for the payment of the right to the holder.
The holder is entitled to a veto of 187 square metres in his block, which means in practice that approval is not required for each holder if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
Holder rights can also be acquired in several segments.
Getting the right to control is something concrete that can be left as an inheritance or as a gift.
You don't have to go carrying banners or chain yourself up somewhere to protect nature," Juha Levikangas, who acquired the right to control his company, explains.
The person acquiring the right to control will receive detailed location information from his block, which will allow, for example, a visit to the block.
On the Foundation's website, the names of the holders of the rights are displayed on the same map where the country block data can be found.
Leviekangas sees its acquisition as a risk only if the Foundation's activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a foundation of general interest aimed at promoting the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the Foundation would act in some way unethical or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The idea behind the Helsinki Foundation's Elf Project is to protect nature areas so that they can be intact and peaceful.
The Foundation acquires land either by buying or donating.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of holders' rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims beyond Finland's borders and plans to purchase land from Australia.
Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
Bike thieves torment Turku most from large cities - see the situation in your municipality of residence
Bicycle thieves torment Turku most from large cities in Finland.
This year more bikes have been stolen relative to the population than in the other nine major cities.
Helsingin Sanomat explained to the police on the basis of reported bike thefts, how many bicycles and parts of bicycles have been stolen in the largest ten cities in January to August of this year, calculated per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti took the lead.
According to police records, four to five bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants took place.
Instead, in Espoo and Kouvola, only about two bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police.
It's a big difference, isn't it?
"In other cities, double thefts occur relative to the number of inhabitants compared to others," describes Police Commissioner Tommi Reen.
The Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have the answer to that.
"The frequency of thieves can be affected by how much bikes are carried in the city and how many bikes there are at all," Sergeant Teemu Eikäs ponders.
Tommi Reen of the Finnish Police Administration thinks it is quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will take the lead in comparison.
The number of bike thefts goes largely according to what are study and cycling cities.
Turku has a dense centre, short distances and lots of bikes available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city, where urban centres are remote from each other and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of mobility," says Reen.
In all of Finland, the number of bicycle thefts reported by the police in January to August has been slightly lower than in the corresponding period of last year.
But there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police report little more than 20,000 bike thefts each year.
It means 50-60 bikes every day and in Helsinki alone about 4 000 bikes a year.
"They're large quantities," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more wheels, for only some of the victims report theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report bike theft, although fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police will be solved.
Typically, unsolved bike theft is one in which the police are informed of the theft immediately and the thief is caught in blood.
"There are also cases during other investigations, when, for example, stolen bikes can be found in the apartment in a drug case," says Reen.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly in the act itself or during police investigation," says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bikes are stolen from, for example, shopping centers' racks, courtyards, warehouses and cellars, or virtually everywhere they are stored.
As in previous years, the highest number of individual wheel models is stolen from Jojoja.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves, for example, take the bike for their short - term use, but most of the stolen wheels end up on sale online, for example.
They remain on the domestic market.
"At least it hasn't come to the police's attention that stolen bikes go abroad," says Reen.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen wheels are common Finns.
Some people probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the used wheel must be vigilant, as he may commit a concealment offence or offence.
"Alarm bells should ring if a fit wheel is sold at a clear price," says Reen.
Special Library Officer Severi Moose carries his colorful Nopsa to the shelters of the Kallio Library in Helsinki every working day.
He's had five bikes, but none of them have been stolen," Moose says. "He's never been taken, he's had a good monk."
"Maybe this doesn't attract thieves so much, this doesn't necessarily have a hipster value," the Helsinki Moose wonders.
Siiri Valve, who quickly visited the kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked his bike with a small U-lock.
Now the bike stomped against the kiosk wall, but in general Valve locks his bike in something solid, such as a bike rack.
"It's gonna be a lot of time to think about it, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," says the student in Helsinki about his white bike, whose trunk alone cost about five hundred euros.
"All the time, you hear from the guys that the bikes have been taken away."
"Mostly bad bikes, such scumbags."
A motorcycle was stolen from the home yard of the building company a year ago.
True, the bike had not been locked, so Valve could expect it to be taken.
Under 15 years of age to be held accountable for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer jurors from the United States
In Helsinki, a peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from getting into a criminal spiral.
Initially, the experiment will apply to those under the age of 15 who are now deprived of criminal responsibility.
The peer jury intervenes in the first crime committed by a young man.
The idea is that the peer jury will discuss what has happened with the perpetrator and impose sanctions.
A week later, the perpetrator may join the peer jury himself to make up for his actions.
Other consequences may include a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Juvenile Director Tommi Laitio tells us that the model is not strict.
We have other forms of conciliation which are used side by side.
"Everyone directs the youth's activities in a more responsible direction so that everything doesn't spoil the first mistake," says Laitio.
The peer jury has been inspired by the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that, after the first crime, a young person does not face an adult panel but reacts to what happened with people about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
The service design agency Palmu's service designer Iikka Lovio, who followed the experiment, says that this was an assault that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes of under 15 years of age may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It's been a message that you'll continue on the path you've chosen," says Lovio.
The peer jury is part of the Helsinki project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new approaches are offered to all those in need, not just to young immigrants.
More than 70 Republican influencers want the party to stop funding Trump's campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding the presidential campaign of Donald Trump.
The letter was reported by the American magazine Politico, who had received a draft of it.
According to the paper, the open letter is addressed to Reince Priebus, president of the Republican National Committee.
The signatories want the party's money to be transferred to the Congressional elections instead of the Trump campaign.
"We believe that the disagreements caused by Donald Trump and his indifference, incompetence and record disfavor threaten to bring a voiceslide to the Democrats in these elections," says Politico.
Only by directing all possible funds to the Congressional elections can the Republicans be prevented from drowning with a Trump-decorated anchor around their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential elections will be reduced from day to day.
Politico writes that the letter is scheduled to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is the Republican Andrew Weinstein, who is prominently opposed to Trump.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from 'people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress' and that it is not a question of supporting anyone.
The letter lists a number of acts by Donald Trump which are believed to have offended millions of voters.
Also, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for families with US children
In the United States, the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton reported on the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I'm running for president to make the American economy work well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is running for president to make the economy work well for him and his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive $ 275 billion five - year program to improve US infrastructure - roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be partly financed by tax increases for the rich, partly by private money.
The construction program is a handshake for American workers who suffer from the relocation of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme the biggest investment in high-paid jobs after World War II.
We are a builder people, we must return to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the status of working families with children.
On Thursday he sounded like Sanders anyway, stressing that the rich should pay their fair share of the taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States to become a tax refugee, it must pay the tax on departure," Clinton said.
Today he is opposed to the free trade agreement in the Pacific, which he previously supported.
"As [President] I am opposed to any trade agreement that works against employees or wages," Clinton promised.
According to speculation published by The Washington Post before Clinton's speech, Clinton was going to criticise the economic programme announced by Republican Donald Trump on Monday for "adopting only millionaires of this kind."
In the past, Clinton has designated Trump as a loophole.
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small businessman himself.
He reminded the listeners of small businessmen whose bills Trump failed to pay, and of the clothes that Trump himself manufactures in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start by making his own products in America," Clinton was picking up.
These are Rio's ratings: The games have not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile app is interesting
Usually, sports competitions are seen in television's ratings as sharp mountain peaks.
So far, the Rio Olympic Games have not reached a huge number of spectators.
At one time, the races have glued 12 percent of the population at best: Tuesday night's swim was followed by 615 000 viewers from Yle Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
By comparison, the European Athletics Championships of one month ago attracted almost 800,000 spectators at a time to TV2, and the European Football Championships of just over another million.
The most interesting of the Olympic sports has so far been Sunday evening biking and the fifth day of the competition's open rack gymnastics, both of which reached the Olympic channel at a time by nearly half a million spectators.
Yle Sports Manager Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the ratings, and reminds us that for the first time in the Rio Olympic Games, viewers are divided into several different instruments.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympic Games from Rio Arena.
We welcome the number of TV viewers who choose the Olympic Games at all.
Even on the television side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports games to which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When you get a shipment 24 hours a day, and you're gonna be watching from 20,000 to 500,000 all the time, it's a good base.
The number of spectators is smaller than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the difference in time - a large proportion of Rio's broadcasts come in Finland at night.
Another reason for a lame interest - if someone now thinks it is lame - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal in the early games, it would have bounced up with it.
In addition, athletics are just beginning, as well as other species of interest to Finns: sailing and riding.
According to Pokkinen, the initial number of viewers has been close to what was expected.
When athletics begins, ratings explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the games, which rose in Apple's App Store as the most downloaded free app in Finland during the first days of the games.
By Monday, the app was uploaded 150,000 times.
I'm guessing we're already about 200,000 downloads.
"We won't get the online ratings until later," Pokkinen says.
Rio Arena has not worked as hoped for all users.
Pokkinen says that feedback has come and the faults have been corrected.
The use of Rio Arena has been accompanied by delays and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
The applications have been updated to correct errors.
The Rio Olympic Games are visible on Yle channels and arenas more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
Yle Fem can be used to track some species, and Yle Speech on the radio transmits races every day.
The Olympic Games are not only perhaps the most laborious for Yle ever, but also the last ones that can only be followed from Yle channels.
From 2018, Olympic sports will be displayed on both the public and commercial channels.
How deep is Finland's deepest lake?
According to official statistics, Finland's deepest lake is Päijänne, whose depth is 95.3 metres on the Crossback.
It may be even deeper.
The technical diving instructor Matti Kannela found a weight of about 20 square meters on the crossback, and the dive computer looked 104 meters deep below the bottom.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried in vain to confirm the observation by sonar.
The method may not find a small depth in 100 metres," says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes include Lake Inari (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and Lake Pääjärvi extend to more than 80 meters.
They have not been studied as closely as Päijänne.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
"There may well be unknown depths," Kannela ponders.
If the deepest lake is defined by average depth, it is the Great Lake Juka, 23 meters.
Looking at this, the Päijänne can't get into the top ten, and Suvasvesi is farther from the top.
Correction on August 12 at 2:29 p.m.: Corrected last paragraph in which the deepest lakes were wrong.
Ihalainen veroista: The taxation of pensioners is still tighter
The taxation of pensioners is still tighter than that of wage and salary earners.
Ihalainen says that the injustice arose during the parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to employees.
This is not included in the government's proposal.
We believe it should definitely be there.
The promises given should be kept up after the election," he says to the media in the West.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received income reductions which reduced taxation.
This was heated by opposition representatives in Parliament, who grilled the then Minister of Finance Alexander Stubb for the electoral promises.
The purchasing power is secure, it's not growing
According to Ihalainen, the policy presented by Minister of Finance, Petteri Orphan, is mainly about safeguarding purchasing power and not increasing wages, since next year there will be no increase in wages.
He says that a tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen welcomes the messages of Prime Minister Juha Sipilän (in June) and Orphan, with a desire to respect the competitive agreement that has been worked out with great effort.
He says that sticking to the Treaty is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government.
It has been done by the social partners, so it should not be ruined by questioning it.
It will be necessary because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people's own faith in the future.
Picking up long-term unemployment in the raffle
The Ihalainen appeals to the government to seize long-term unemployment in the budget, at least to halt its growth.
In June, the number of long-term unemployed was around 17,000 higher than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's target of raising the employment rate to 72% will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: There are no known Finnish casualties in the attacks in Thailand
In Thailand last night and last night, at least four people died during the bombings in Finland's time.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to be alert and avoid the most busy tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists intending to visit Thailand should not cancel their trip due to explosions, but the embassy's instructions on caution should be followed," Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish travel season in Thailand dates back to the turn of the year.
The vast majority of tourists from Thailand come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook since the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach Finns in Hua Hin in particular to learn more about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be fine," Westphalen says.
No information on the author
Westphalen says the attacker hasn't been reported yet.
The ambassador believes that events may be linked to the political unrest in Thailand's divided society and to last week's referendum on the military junta's constitution.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open democratic process.
Among other things, there were arrests of people who said they were against the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, there is an ethnic-national conflict involving the Muslim population," Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today is a big local holiday in Bangkok, Westphalen says.
According to him, the city celebrates Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks should affect the day's course so that the authorities are extremely careful about safety.
Thai police: The attacks do not involve international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and are different from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been excluded, says the Thai police according to the AP.
During the day, at least four people have died in Thailand when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as tourists in Phuket and Hua Hin.
Even in a tourist destination favored by Finns, the holiday island of Phuket exploded four bombs last night, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current information, they did not require any casualties.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the paper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where, according to the newspaper, one person was wounded.
According to local authorities, a total of four bombs have exploded at the popular tourist destination in Hua Hin yesterday and today.
At least one person died in both double-bomb attacks.
In addition, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Than and in the city of Trang in South Thailand.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it travels to the resort islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
Unknown attacker
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the military junta in Thailand, the attacker is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not incite people to panic any more," he said to journalists.
According to Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, Deputy Prime Minister for Security, at least the attacks by Hua Hin and Trang are linked.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators were meant to destroy the country's tourism, because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy urges Finns in the country to be alert and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns intending to go to Thailand have no reason to cancel their trip due to explosions, but it is worth following the instructions of the unsuspecting to be careful," Westphalen says.
Europeans in wounded
So far very little is known about the attacks and their victims during the night in Finland.
There's been a little bit more information about the attack last night in Hua Hin.
A local woman died and more than 20 others were wounded, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were wounded in the latter attack of Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded near a bell tower known as the sights.
Thai PBS reports that the police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where it believes it has found another bomb.
According to the governor of the county, Surat Than's bomb was hidden in a flowerbed.
An employee of the county died in the attack.
There's at least one wounded.
The chief of police interviewed by CNN reports that two bombs were also used in the Surat Than attack, which exploded about half an hour apart.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles won the women's four-game
U.S. Alexandra Raisman was second in 60,098 and Russian Alija Mustafina third in 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, is still in pursuit of racking championships at the Rio Games in permanna, jumping and booms.
Biles has been in control of women's gymnastics to the full over the last few years.
He has eight personal world championships from the previous three seasons.
He has won the four-game and perm championships three times in a row, and the boom last year and the year before.
In the U.S. team, Biles has won two World Championships.
We're gonna have a slimmer World Championship... and we're gonna have a jump and a boom.
Thailand's Finnish entrepreneur: "The hit has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a children's play club in Phuket in Thailand, is not concerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I don't think there will be any more miracles, evaluate the Huvila, who has worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about 20 years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many tragedies near Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was the tsunami, then there was the avian flu, and last year there was a bombing in Bangkok.
If these previous ones haven't banished tourists, I don't think this has either.
The office of the villa company is located a few hundred meters from the site of the explosion.
The villa heard about the attack from its own employee.
The employee called at about 9:00 a.m. local time and said it was best not to come to the office.
The villa says that both the promenade and main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been put on for the queen's birthday," says the Huvila and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
Patong had a calm atmosphere and the main street movements were allowed to open at about ten o'clock local time.
A lot of people on the beach hadn't even heard of the attacks.
At half past half past three in the day, in Patong, the traffic had normalized and a large proportion of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the attack, the explosion has been pretty small, says the Huvila, who visited the attack site.
Later, the car was seen in the crown shop in Jouxholminte.
When the police got there, the car was set on fire.
The patrol found two men who fit the description hidden in the nearby spruce.
The other man was immediately apprehended.
One of them ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft of use of a motor vehicle, theft and aggravated damage.
The police are thanking those who gave us the clues.
Research Director for Russia's Change of Director: Clear exclusion
On Friday, Russia made the highest leadership change in years when President Vladimir Putin dismissed Sergei Ivanov, head of his regime.
Ivanov's successor is 44-year-old Anton Persecution.
He's an ex-distant. He's a second-in-command in Ivanov.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov's dismissal may be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from gaining too much power.
He adds that recycling management is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from building power independent of the President himself.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been in trouble with other leaders or screwed up.
Station drop for Ivanov
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, will move on to special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
On the tape presented by the state media, Putin said that the amendment to the joint decision was to be made.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other assignments and proposed Persecution to replace him," said Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view it is a clear drop in position.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in Russia's order of importance.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the President's Security Council.
During the Soviet Union, Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB.
He was considered a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but became President Dmitri Medvedev.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, such as governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi of the Institute for Foreign Policy says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place is that Putin changes his close friends to younger ones.
Isis fighters used civilians as human shields in their withdrawal in Syria
They used civilians as human shields to flee to the city of Jarabulus, so that we would not target them," said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were stationed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters took control of approximately 90% of Manbij's city, which is important to ISIS.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists were then left in the city.
Corrected with earlier news at 7:30 p.m.: Previously, we wrongly reported that civilians were fleeing the city, actually being abducted by Isis fighters as they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior's document disclosure policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on public access to documents is illegal," says Professor Tomi Voutilainen of public law from the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells STT that public access to documents cannot be based on the authority's own policies but is based on the law.
In the past, the Ministry of the Interior refused to hand over a list of participants for the Home Secretary's events to the Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision with instructions from the Prime Minister's Office and the fact that the information had been recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Ministry's Communications Director tells STT that the Ministry has identified the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's final Olympic show begins in Rio
Like in the past few years, Bolt has been running against time.
He insulted his buttocks from the beginning of the year and had to skip the Olympic qualifying in Jamaica.
This hasn't been the perfect preparation, but I'm in much better shape.
I have practiced well and that is the key," Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low - costing samba dancers and fan - turned journalists.
Poriina Bolt's surroundings underline that the Jamaican star has risen in a time when athletics have struggled with doping scandals and slipping interest.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he was cut off in the first 200 metres in the period 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by injuries and a loose exercise attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at a hundred meters, where he crushed the world record and the final celebration of the competitors' self - confidence, despite the time of 9.69.
This is gonna be harder.
One year later in the World Cup in Berlin, Bolt reached his career at a legal point with a clock.
The world record of 9,58 100 metres and 19,19 in Berlin is still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a world record of 200 metres and 19 seconds, but that is the only thing anyone believes in is Bolt himself.
The biggest challenger in 100 Bolt is Justin Gatlin, Olympic winner of the 100th of Athens 2004.
Last year, at the Beijing World Cup final, Bolt defeated an American with only one hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost in the finals of the Games once if he has made it.
In Daegu 2011 the 100th World Cup final was not run by Bolt because of the fraudulent departure.
Bolt's gonna be 30 in just over a week.
He's an old man in the young men's sport, and the Rio Games are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set next year's World Championship in London.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the others.
I'm older and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it," Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Reveals from Rio: two athletes suspected of drug abuse
According to Xinhua, China's state news agency, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive anti-doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
The Chinese swimmer, Chen Xinyi, found traces of banned substances in his drug sample.
Also, Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan athletic coach was sent home because he gave an anti-doping sample on behalf of an athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given an anti-doping sample showing signs of an EPO hormone.
He was fourth in the women's 100-metre butterfly suit in Rio.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has brought his doping case to the Court of Appeal of Sport (CAS).
Xinhua reports that the Xinyi sample on Sunday had shown signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping suspects have also emerged in Rio.
The BBC reports that Silvia Danekova, a Bulgarian female barrier runner, has given an anti-doping sample showing signs of an EPO hormone.
Kenya, on the other hand, has sent an athletic coach home from Rio for doping.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee, KOK, told us that the Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete in a test situation and had submitted an anti-doping sample on his behalf.
According to media records, it's a Kenyan fast-run coach, John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used Ferguson Rotich's race pass, a 500 - foot runner.
Phelps will not be stopped by anything - historical gold came in show style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swim 200 metres in mixed swimming, his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold.
At the same time, Phelps, as the first swimmer, reached the Olympic gold of the same species in four consecutive races.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino was second in mixed swimming before the Chinese Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have some fun, BBC Olympic Swimming Commentator Helen Skelton is laughing at the Instant Interview of Evening Magazine.
The story about Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read on the evening magazine website this week.
Next to Commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't stress much if there's a little noise in the social media or the British press about his revealing and special outfits.
Television is a visual media, he emphasizes.
Skelton is wearing high heels and a shorter dress with at least enough exposure - at least for the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
However, there are no steps to be taken.
It's important to look good, and little fuss is just a funny thing.
I'm sure Skelton would like to be thrilled and perhaps does, but he insists that he doesn't want to play the leading role.
This isn't about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus needs to be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine the fuss going all the way to Finland?
I can't, but anything that pays attention to how hard these swimmers work and how much sacrifice they make is okay with me, Skelton grinning.
You know what?
It is a fuss about nothing if it comes from (the host) dressing.
I'm a little amused if something like this has hit someone's radar.
The police in Rio made two arrests for a suspected terrorist attack.
On Thursday, the Rio police announced that they had arrested two people for suspected terrorism.
The police made the arrests in connection with the security surveillance of the races.
In the same context, the police committed five other arrests and questioned two persons before their release.
All suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news site, people arrested for terrorism belong to the same group that was arrested by the police as early as July.
The arrests are believed to be connected to the Isis-Radio organization.
The arrests had reportedly fueled violence in social media.
Messages to encourage violence had been distributed in the popular WhatsApp service, among others.
There are 85 000 police officers responsible for the safety of the Rio Games.
Police blew up a suspicious package in Rio.
Spain and Nigeria had to start their first game of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
The police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place to the public.
The police let the public in after they had controlledly blew up the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics when the police have completed a controlled detonation mission.
The police shut down the arena because of the suspicious package that was found there.
The crowd got in after the police had controlledly blew up the package.
The audience did not get to the audience by the start of the match because the police closed the arena for a while because of the suspicious package found in the hall.
The police blew up the package and let the public into the hangar only after that.
The drink woke up the Spanish team that dreamedly started the races.
Spain, which started with two losses, won Nigeria by 96-87.
In the last two races, Spain reached silver.
The police performed a controlled blasting mission for the third time during the summer Games in Rio.
Last time the police had to blow up a suspicious discovery in the vicinity of the road cycling destination last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their first game of the Rio basketball tournament in front of empty audiences.
Argentina's Lady Betrayal Siren - a Finn pondered a protest
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
The wind Betrayal Siren went through a lot on Thursday.
On Thursday, in Rio, the Argentinan lady bubbled Tuuli Petäjä-Siren at the opening of the women's surf day.
The winds were clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the violation.
He got stuck because of the accident, and the others ran away," told Joakim Wilenius, head coach of Finland.
The athlete considered a protest for a long time.
Then it was not worth doing, because according to the Olympic rules it would have been useless.
I should have fallen into the water to get compensation, said the Betrayal Siren.
The Finn hung on his board until the last time because he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
The Finnish citizen was left in position of 27 with the accident.
In the overall situation, London's 2012 Olympic silver medalist is the eighth.
The accident didn't have much effect on the tip.
Friday's a big day when you have to race 10-12.
Edit 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not make a protest.
7 Special Things That Scientically Longen the Age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proved to bring more years into a person's life.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect a person's health so that his or her life is prolonged.
Sometimes things that a person cannot control can bring to him additional years.
These include, for example, a tendency to body fat or social status.
Regular shopping may extend your age.
Sometimes you don't even have to stick around... just getting a milk can is enough.
The secret of longevity has been explored through various studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the most bizarre research results.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drinking has been found to protect against certain cancers, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
A Harvard University study concluded that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a "low risk of death," especially in relation to neurological or cardiac diseases.
Again, alcohol is advocated by studies that moderate consumption - from one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of dental floss can extend a person's life by as much as six years, says one study.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents gum infections.
On the other hand, they can contribute to the emergence of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway found out how laughing affected a person's life.
The seven-year-old project watched over 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to be alive after the test ended.
Sex, when protection against sexually transmitted diseases has been taken into account, is, according to many studies, good for health.
In addition, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, merely having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years in his or her life, he or she must also have an orgasm.
Of course, physical activity brings more years, and there is no denying that.
However, achieving longevity does not require absolute dwindling.
One study at Oxford University found that women with a large butt had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their system.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality.
Whether it's an athlete or an actor who won the Oscar at the Olympics, he's more likely to live beyond the average puppy.
A lot of research has been trying to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings more years into his life.
On the other hand, some researchers suspect that longevity is due to a person's social status - which, for its part, enables recognition such as the Nobel Prize to be sought.
A study of shopping behaviour among people aged 65 and over found that a person who shops daily is likely to be less likely to be older than those who shop.
This is because it reduces loneliness when running in concrete shops.
Once again, it has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may lead to early death.
So put down your credit card - online shopping doesn't have the same effect.
Drunk drunk driver fell into a truck.
On Friday night, a serious truck and passenger car crash occurred in Southwest Finland's Koskke.
The accident took place in Koskella, in the middle of Koskentie and Sorvastontie on Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car that came into contact had drifted into the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the crash, the truck stayed in its lane, but caught fire.
The driver managed to put the fire out himself.
The passenger car went into the ditch and then over the ditch on its roof.
A woman born in 1972 who carried a passenger car was squeezed into her car.
The rescue department removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to the Turku University Hospital for treatment.
The result of the woman's breath test was 2.02 per mil.
He's a suspect in an aggravated DUI.
The mail sent loose candy to the wrong town.
Salon K-Citymarket's range of candy was incomplete because the mail had accidentally delivered part of the load to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was buying candy from Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign struck her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product shortages in loose sweets because Posti delivered our cargo to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when Posti gets the load!
So if there's no traffic in lawn mowing, the sign said.
The trader's scrambling sign is linked to the fact that Posti extended its services last spring to include lawn cutting.
The lawn mowing is available until the end of August.
Haltia felt that the sign was mainly amusing and decided to share it in social media.
The popularity of the update knocked me out.
Media representatives have also been calling all the time, and the attention this issue attracts is incredible, Hal is wondering.
On Friday night, the update of Haltia had over 700 splits on Facebook.
Elf was able to grab his own favorites in a candy bag, even though a few ladies were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the business of Posti's Business Transport Services, regretted the damage to EveningSanom.
The background is that three of the five pallets strayed yesterday to the wrong place (Seinäjoki) and we didn't leave for part delivery (Saloon) in three, but only today we took five pallets, Kaidesoja told The Evening Words.
It's the first thing you've heard about it is The Evening Words.
Teija Haltia was not indignant about the sign because she found all her favorites in the selection.
Dizzy weight loss! 30 kg lighter Lotta Backlund released a picture of her change
The comedian producer has worn out tens of kilos since the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost ten pounds as a result of a change in life.
On Friday, Lotta shared a pair of pictures of her change on Instagram.
In the spring, Lotta was on a gym course, aiming for a normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
The comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund, started his dieting work as early as 2009.
He has undergone a complete change in lifestyle and has gradually lost some 20 pounds [30 kg].
On Friday, Backlund released a pair of pictures of his staggering performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed in appearance over the years.
Backlund's pre- and post-image pair has collected several commendable comments from co-smokers.
You're gorgeous.
We're on the same trip, motivation hard! one of us is glowing.
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the project "Let's do it now."
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your photos when I'm on the same journey myself, the other one tells me.
In the spring, Lotta dropped some of the last pounds on the "Let's do it now" project.
At that time he told The Evening Magazine that he wanted to finally get to a normal weight that was ten kilos away.
During a three - month course of exercise, five pounds eventually fell.
The family of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Remembering the victim for the good of police dogs
The family of a 42-year-old woman murdered a week ago in Loviisa hopes that the victim will be remembered by donation instead of flowers and adres for police work.
Sipoo Veterinarian Station has released a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim's family's desire for donations for police dogs.
The publication tells us that the victim had worked as a substitute at Sipoo Veterinarian Station and had also completed her nursing training there.
The vet station remembers the woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, sense of humor, and unafraid of work.
Dear Friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the whole donation money goes to police dogs, primarily the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Lovisian woman was murdered in her own home yard in Koskenkylä, Loviisa.
The woman's neighbors have told Evening Magazine that the victim was very dear to animals.
He owned several animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens, and a rooster.
A 27-year-old male suspected of murder didn't know the woman, and they had no connection with her.
The killer was tracked down by a police dog, Börje, who was wounded in an arrest.
But Börje survived and is recovering.
The District Court handed down a judgment against the Post for breach of the Equality Act
Posti had no right to retain the salary of the employee who refused to familiarize the temporary agency worker, assessed by the District Court of Kanta-Häme in its judgment.
The District Court ordered Post to pay the employee most of the paid salary and EUR 2 000 in compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have withheld only part of the introductory salary corresponding to the share of the education in the entire day's work.
According to the District Court, the employee was placed at a disadvantage by virtue of his trade union activities in breach of the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with the Union for Postal and Logistics (PAU) Association Decision on the prohibition of familiarisation.
During last November's postal strike, PAU took a decision not to familiarize Posti's employees with temporary workers who break the strike.
First, the People's News.
Return Turkey to a path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, written by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (Ps.) in his reply to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In a letter earlier, the Journalist Federation asked Sipilä and Soin to express their concern in favour of freedom of expression and freedom of the press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini report that Finland repeatedly brought to Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and of expression.
Putin fired the chief of his regime - in place of the Estonian-born Persecution
Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired Sergei Ivanov, Head of the Presidential Administration, says the Kremlin.
Karl Persecutor of the Communist Leader of Soviet Estonia, Anton Persecution.
Persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
Persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council," says Interfax.
Vladimir Putin fired the chief of his administration.
According to the Kremlin press release, Ivanov, a member of Putin's deep inner circle, will be transferred to special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer and suggested Persecution to replace him," says Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in the KGB espionage.
Many considered Ivanov a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed President in 2011 before Putin was re-elected in 2012.
BBC: acquisition of ManU's giant ban - not seen in the opening of the Championship
A world record player in football transfers is not seen in the field when the English Champion League is kicked off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban followed him to England.
Manchester United's huge acquisition of Paul Pogba is on the sidelines because of the ban on gambling, when ManU opened its league on Sunday against Bournemouth," said the BBC on Friday.
According to the British media, ManU paid Juventus the Italian Society of Pogba EUR 105 million.
However, the British Football League (FA) keeps him out of the game, as Pogba left Juventus under a ban.
He received two warnings in last season's Italian Cup, and it will be a one-game ban.
That ban has been moved to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is the league's second round on August 19, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, the madness of greatness is a virtue.
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of entertainment have established the status of Flow Festival as an internationally respected event starred by the world's top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festival vagrants have typically expressed themselves in distinctive dress.
One of the main stage artists this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
Flow Festival event area is styled with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to have just the main stage and the beer tent," says the artistic director of the event Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival in Suvilahti, Helsinki this weekend has grown from a small block festival to an event of tens of thousands of visitors.
The background to the success is a simple question: What kind of event would the authors themselves like to go to?
It's quite unusual in transactional productions to think this way.
The goal is often to achieve the level of necessity and to act in accordance with official regulations," says the artistic director Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow was going to sell out again this year.
The aim has been to raise the number of visitors to the 70 000 last year by 5 000.
A number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists will be seen at the festivals again this year.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because something needs to be funded.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle that is controlled on huge routes.
That's not what we want.
During 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been expanded so that there are 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurant points and drinks bars in the semi-terrestrial area.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stage, 15 000 people's tent is the venue this year.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out in a simpler way.
Maybe I'm a bit of a megalomaniac, but at the same time, we've been able to preserve Flow's life.
If you lose it, it's not our thing anymore.
For the rock, the greatest joy and reward for the work done is that even great visions are practically possible today.
During the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, operations were highly dependent on the City of Helsinki's support of around EUR 20,000.
Last year, the turnover of the company running Flow was around EUR 6 million.
It can be used to produce "Greek things" like the construction of that 73-meter-wide tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves in distinctive dress.
Alongside the music event, we can also talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event is not consciously profiled to be particularly fashionable.
We want to stand out above all in terms of content.
Still, fashion phenomena also fit the values of Flow: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment," says Kallio.
This year one of the main stage artists is a punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer of the festival that combines indierock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because it's probably the last time she's seen at a gig in Finland.
We're all interested in history and the future.
It's not just what's on the commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good and he's been doing some damn good gigs in the last few years.
The bombs of Thailand's tourist paradise were hidden in flower pots - tourists fled terrified
In Hua Hin, two bombs exploded on Thursday night.
At least one local woman died in the attack and over 20 were injured.
Apparently, the bombs were hidden in a flower pot and blown up with cell phones.
Bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreign.
They were detonated at the same time as the tourists began to leave the bars and return to their hotels, according to Samoer Youngumran CNN, a police representative.
Since 1989, the protector of wild animals in Asia, Edwin Wiek, tweeted a picture of the attacks.
If the tweet doesn't show up properly, you can watch it right here.
At least 11 of the injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran up against me and said the bomb had exploded at the bar.
It happened on one of the largest bars," said Swedish Stuartist Emelie Olsson to Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Than.
At least one of them died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon thereafter, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, which the Finns favored.
No one was reported to have died.
At the same time, another double-bomb attack took place in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were wounded.
In addition, a bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
The police reportedly found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, there are probably rebel forces behind the bombings who are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to estimates by local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently been very active in the activities of criminal organisations involved in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new stand-by troops will go into battle first in a military situation.
In an acute war situation, soldiers are ordered to battle until several months after taking the military oath, says the Central Finn.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, the Chief of Defence Forces Training, interviewed by the newspaper, for example, of military officers serving 5.5 months in a military situation, only those who are in the final stages of their training are eligible for combat.
According to the head of training, first recruits will be assigned to the reserve forces.
No shipwreckman or reservist is told to do a job without the required training," says Sonninen.
Earlier in the summer, it became apparent that the Defence Forces will start training military personnel in immediate readiness units starting next year.
If necessary, units may be used for military operations even during military training.
Pamela Tola received huge compensations for the mold house
Actor Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough fight over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of a two-storey apartment had been EUR 330 000.
After the sale, however, a serious problem of moisture was discovered in the house, causing a health - threatening microbial growth.
The couple had to sell the apartment in condition of demolition in 2014.
The sales price had dropped to EUR 132 000, so financial losses to Tola and Waroma amounted to as much as EUR 198 000.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller there.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case both at the District Court and the Court of Appeal.
The court of appeal handed down the case on Wednesday.
It upheld the District Court's judgment ordering the seller to pay a price reduction of EUR 150 000 to Tola and Waroma.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 344 for the costs of legal proceedings and settlement of the couple.
The right moderated the price reduction slightly because some of the need to repair the dwelling had already been known to the buyers when the dwelling was being traded.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the errors revealed were more serious than what had been presented.
Tola was looking for a fit home.
At the Court of Appeal, Tola told us that the couple had been looking for a home in good condition because they did not want to take up repairs.
He had the impression that the building was renovated and in good condition and that the elements mentioned in the fitness check report were not harmful.
The physical inspection report identified ventilation as risks and disadvantages and the lack of adequate management of rain and melting water flowing along the rock surface.
However, on the basis of the discussions, it did not appear that this was an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma remained under the impression that rainwaters from the rocks should perhaps be controlled a little over a few years.
The deal was made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it turned out that the moisture problems in the apartment were far more serious than thought.
Checks carried out in 2012 and 2013 revealed microbial growth in the building, according to the Witnesses, due to both the rainwaters in the rock and the soil moisture that had risen capillaryly.
On the west side of the house, microbes - contaminated air could, according to the inspector's estimate, also enter the interior through the porch.
There was mold or yeast that allowed health risk beyond the limit values in the home care room, in the basement stairwell, in the living room windower and in the basement washroom.
The terraces were built without permission
The court also debated whether the apartment had been extended in violation of the building permit.
The court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the City of Espoo's decision to change the dwelling in breach of the permit before the sale.
For example, terraces had been built even though there were no proper permits yet.
However, home problems were central in court.
According to the Court of Appeal, the buyers could, on the basis of information received from the seller prior to the sale, assume that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no need for major repairs in the near future.
In the view of the Court of Appeal, Tola and Waroma had no particular reason to carry out a more extensive inspection than usual.
Buyers have not failed to comply with their reporting obligation, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Creepy Archive Discovery: Hundreds of thousands of women wanted to have children for the Nazis - in the register also Finns
Reporter Christopher Andersson writes in his recent article by Dagens Nyheter how the US National Archives in Maryland contain documents for microfilms covering a total of 218 500 women, all of whom wanted to marry SS men.
The majority of women are German, but also include Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian, 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to become Nazi brides.
Documents and registration cards originate from the National Race Agency in Nazi Germany.
The Race Agency was under the command of SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true of women, even more so, who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynaecological studies were carried out on women to investigate this issue.
The Race Agency studied women's backgrounds, including by studying church books.
The purpose was to make sure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women were also to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and handwritten life stories to the Race Agency, as well as good recommendations from those close to them.
The Race Agency wanted guarantees that women were "lovers of children," "savory" and "good national socialists," who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as SS men's fiancées.
The story doesn't tell us what happened to the 14 Finnish women who were found in the archive documents.
The SS leaders created a state-supported program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that each SS man should have four children, either in or outside marriage.
Lebensborn homes take care of children and their mothers born out of wedlock.
However, the program was not promoted very actively, reports the pages of the American Holocaust Museum.
On the other hand, the Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The government encouraged marriage by providing loans and supporting childbearing.
The German mother's Cross of Honor was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum's website states.
On the sixth of the Cheater Sire, the Church rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko was third in sailing at the first departure of Finnjollie's day at the Olympic Games in Rio, but remained the peak of the whole group at the second departure of the day.
In the overall situation, the church rose eighth after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to 14.
Wind Pete-Siren fought RS:X-class day slots in positions 17 and 3.
In the overall situation, Petäjä-Siren is number six.
In 470, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren were placed in 23rd place at the start of the day.
In the overall situation, the Lindgrens rank 19.
Jari Bridgehead's Satulinna was recorded with a couple of hours of sleep: "I was so hungover"
Jari Sillanpää has been a favorite Finnish artist for over 20 years.
From the bartender of the cruise ship to the Tango King of 1995, to the best sold solo artist in Finland, to the star of dance platforms and festivals, Bridgenpää continues to whip and is currently in a wild lift.
The book Jari Bridgenpää, written by Mari Koppinen, on the life of a favorite singer, was published today on Thursday.
In the book Bridgehead tells about his life and career in both good and bad.
Bridgehead's career became a total climber when he won the crown of the Tango King in the Seinäjoki Tango market in 1995.
In the race Bridgehead sang tangoes, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppanmäki had composed a tango piece for Bridgepää at the man's request, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different shape.
The Satulinna song became one of the most popular songs in Finland's music history.
The book says, however, that the recording of the song did not go according to plan: Bridgehead sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and after only a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so hung over!
Bridgehead remembers in the book.
The recording of a song that has become a huge hit does not immediately suggest that it has been sung in a hangover.
Even though I wasn't physically at my best, the print was still good.
I learned that you don't have to insist on perfection and excellence all the time.
Another incident related to the man's most popular songs, reported in the book, took place nearly 20 years later.
In 2013, Bridgehead resigned from his then partner and the case finally ended up in the texts of the You Deserve Gold song, which was published on single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered from Sarah Törmänen were not what Bridgehead would have wanted.
Bridgehead had imagined that he was making a record that tells a true story about his own life, but the words of the song about the divorce were not true; it was written on the basis of the 7-day news.
In the newspaper's news, Jar and his ex-love were told that Jari was too much partying and drinking, but Jari said it was a bunch of bullshit and it wasn't true.
According to the book, Jari called the label furiously and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and that's good.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
Eventually, 52% of the voters were in favour of the difference and 48% would have stayed in the Union, although the poll polls foresaw the opposite outcome.
Britain's economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in their determination to remain in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged for the divorce, although a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
Basic mantra of Western politics, the theme "It's the economy, stupid" of the former US President Bill Clinton's recent election campaign flew into the junkyard in the British Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when their voices weren't heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important political issue.
Economic Curly Language
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macro-Economics calls for responses from the profession to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not listened to, because this time the electorate took a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation for the loss of economic standing by economists is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the impression that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people employed, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's off the real British.
Many also have the impression that a fall in the value of the currency would be a good thing, because it will promote the export industry.
In the opinion of the economist, the electorate did not believe the economic arguments because the consensus of economists was not sufficiently expressed.
They were particularly fomented by the BBC's fairness, which allowed only a couple of percent of the economists in favour of the EU's difference to the overwhelming majority.
The hostile press in the EU were not interested in explaining the views of IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other combinations of economic power letters on the consequences of the separation.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly of economic growth, trade relations, sovereign debt, and currency.
And if the messages of economists were both listened to and understood, they were ignored because economists represent an elite with whom voters do not feel that they share common interests.
Academics such as economists would have stayed in the EU, but the message was not working in small towns and rural areas.
Immigration is an economy
The overwhelming argument of the Brexit vote for victory was about immigration.
The immigrant will take your job, the immigrant will crowd your hospital, the immigrant will take advantage of you.
These arguments work.
Every café has foreign employees.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
In every waiting room in the health center, you can see immigrants.
How much easier would a British doctor be if they didn't exist?
Every school has children from immigrants.
How much easier could the children of the real British get a place to go to school if they got rid of them?
There are foreigners living in every municipality.
How much more room would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond to them and, if they did, their responses were not visible.
Economists failed to explain that immigrants have made it possible for the British to have more jobs, fewer health center queues and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially migrants in the EU - are net contributors to British public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund prepared for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are carried out by Pertti Vanhanen from Finland.
According to him, in Aberdeen, preparations were made for Brexit in time by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B, or the victory of the EU-divorce camp, began to be better prepared a few weeks before the vote in case the result was a leave.
The concern was that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds do not normally have large liquid assets, but they could now be necessary.
We went out to raise some cash.
When the Brexit happened on 23rd, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says about Aberdeen's only open-ended daily real estate fund to which the news related.
According to the old man, the normal rate would be between 15 and 20 percent.
At that time, the value of the fund was GBP 3.5 billion.
The total value of the company's funds is approximately GBP 20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds," says Vanhanen of all open real estate funds in Britain.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was 10% or even below it.
The real estate funds were therefore prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
The funds closed the deal.
When the camp in favour of EU separation won, Europe went crazy.
However, the two weeks following the vote in the real estate market were quite calm," says Vanhanen.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was the speech by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a major risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trade.
Together, they robbed the situation and put it in the main headings of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was compared immediately to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
Snowball started spinning, and one fund after another had to close its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash collected, but it also had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the old man, they did not actually close the deal but changed pricing downwards.
In practice, he said that investors were given time to consider whether the money should now be pulled out in panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you do not now have to take your money out, it would not be worth it, because it would result in losses.
It calmed things down, and most of them canceled the report.
Since then it has been quite smooth, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks," says Vanhanen.
He points out that there has been no corresponding turmoil in the continental European funds of Aberdeen, for example.
However, there were a lot of inquiries.
Excessive attention to real estate funds
Vanhanen felt that closing down the real estate fund business received undue attention.
The open funds that were closed control around 4% of British real estate.
Aberdeen's lockdown lasted six days and the company sold less than ten properties out of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might hold on to its fund for 2017.
At present there is uncertainty in the air and economic growth forecasts have been rallied downwards, but the situation does not seem to be "crazier" for Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has brought even new opportunities for some real estate investors," Vanhanen points out.
The price of pounds and dollars is at its lowest in 30 years, with a 15% discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
A dollar-dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30 percent cheaper.
There are many willing buyers," Vanhanen says.
Brexit brought negatives to the London real estate market
At 2 a.m., things didn't look too good yet.
But at four o'clock when Pertti Vanhanen, responsible for the property investments of the British Property Fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the power word.
I realized that this is now on plan B's side," Vanhanen says in his other home in Helsinki.
He went straight to work.
London City was already fully alive despite the morning.
The TV screens normally provided for silence at the office were a source of news, and normally noisy people were completely silent when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell about his resignation.
When the market opened, all the screens flashed was red.
It was a morning you never thought you'd live," Vanhanen says.
Not that, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain's largest real estate funds, completed two real estate transactions on the day after the Brexit vote, i.e. Midsummer.
It was a mess.
However, the company had been well prepared for the alternative, so the situation was calm in a way," says Vanhanen.
Brexit vote started the repair movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership changed.
The market started to anticipate drastic bills for the British real estate market, especially in London.
London's office facilities were predicted to have a deficit of up to 20% in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after another.
Aberdeen did it for six days.
Now it's gone, but there's still uncertainty in the air.
However, it is not visible on the face of Vanhanen, who spent his last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
He thinks it is far too early to say much about what will happen with Brexit.
So much is still open: how the separation takes place and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already been first reported.
The real estate service company CBRE's data on price developments cover about one third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City office buildings, the minus was 6.1 per cent, Vanhanen lists.
The figures aren't so bad, but they're monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only in five months there have been worse figures," says Vanhanen.
All the same falls took place in the 2007 and 2008 crisis years.
It is also interesting because Brexit was compared quite quickly with the collapse of Lehman and the global economic crisis that started with the US real estate market.
The old man doesn't think the parable is quite appropriate, because now it is a domestic crisis in Britain.
It's a different mood, too.
The real estate market has not seen panic sales such as that period, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity," Vanhanen says.
There's a financial jacket. It's normal.
The repair movement could have been ahead of us anyway.
In fact, he doesn't think that the price adjustment movement is a miracle - it could have been in front of him even without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen's estimate, property prices in London and other world's top cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City and especially offices are overpriced," Vanhanen says.
So the drop started really high.
London prices have climbed for four reasons, the Vanhanen list.
Britain's economy has grown strongly, London's population has grown strongly.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last category of ownership that is becoming globalised," Vanhanen says.
New players have emerged from the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London, as a well-known city, is an easy target.
In addition, prices have been fed by low interest rates, which have forced pension companies, for example, to look for returns in new destinations.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although according to Vanhanen, the leverage has now been clearly less used than during the boom before the crisis in 2008.
Spread out, spread out.
In London the rise in prices settled last summer," says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen also began to lighten its holdings in London and was a net seller last year.
There was some sort of twist to be expected, and now it's coming.
So what's next?
It depends on how the British economy develops," Vanhanen says.
He doesn't have the courage to judge what's coming, but he says that there's probably not gonna be a shot.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a downward or steady trend ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen several movements up and down, as he has been in the real estate business since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who thinks they can handle the pits by work.
If you are well prepared for risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you've invested in one market, you're too much of a victim.
If you have decentralised, the risks are also decentralised," Vanhanen says.
S Group starts registering more closely than before
Soon the S Group will know what you are eating, as the trading group announced today that it will start collecting more detailed information about its regular customers' purchases.
Up to now, when data have been collected on the total amount of the receipt, the group will begin to collect it from purchased products at the beginning of May.
The S-Group will come after Kesko here because the information on goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, the CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the customer's consent and is used subject to authorisation for marketing.
The most efficient channel is e-mail.
Quite a few customers have banned the use of product information," says Riitala to Talousanomi.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to the S Group's registration change.
Kesko classifies its regular customers according to mere grocery purchases into ten groups.
The classification is updated monthly.
Loyalty customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The information is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product specific purchase data are collected only from the K-Group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a regular customer program and it is not planned for now.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own customer base program, 1kkösbonus, which can be joined in Selection Houses, Siwos and Euromarkets.
At the moment, we do not collect product or group-level data, we stick to the total value of the receipt.
So we know which store the purchases were made and what day and the customer's receipt total.
We haven't gone to the level K-Group or S-Group," says Commercial Director Anu Ora.
According to him, the regular customer programme will be reformed in the future, but the local store will report on it later.
However, the Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
First of all, the experiment
SOK's customer ownership and customer register has been relatively wide up to now.
In addition to personal and address information, the basic data included the profession, education, form of residence, and the years of birth of children and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role are also registered.
The date and time of purchase, place, total of purchases and payment method are recorded from the S-Front card purchase.
In addition, S-bonus partners' information has been obtained from their cash registers.
From the beginning of May, product level purchase data will start to be deposited in Sokos and Emotion chains.
On the other hand, data are currently recorded at product group level in S-markets, Prismos, Kodin Terros and ABC chains.
Customers have been hoping for a long time that the marketing could be more targeted," says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Ownership and Partner Operations at SOK.
The S Group says that it informs its customers of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data are stored in the bags, whether you like it or not.
You can check your stored data on the S Group's website.
For example, cashiers cannot access the data," says Saarikoski.
Video: Heila-puppy is Customs' latest dog reinforcement - the puppy becomes the first explosive decorator
The black Labrador retriever's cub sniffs vigorously five similar boxes lined up in the country at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long before it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs Inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog to play with its favorite toy.
From the box next to which Heila sat, a jar of shell casings fragranted to the powder gas was exposed.
Gunpowder gas is the first smell that has been practiced with Heila," says Suntio, owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and main reasons for the online trade
Heila is Customs' first dog specialising in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossing points and ports, if necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila's main job because the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused measures in Customs, and after the attacks surveillance has been strengthened," says Customs Superintendent Mikko Grönberg.
Another main reason for the training of a gun and explosive device dog Customs' tasks are postal items transiting through Helsinki Airport.
As a result of the increased internet trade, up to 40 million postal items are transiting through the airport each year, including weapons and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made some 300 discoveries related to weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives and their precursors from online shopping at Helsinki Airport.
Heila will work across Helsinki Airport.
It will investigate registered baggage and mail.
There will be great benefits in ports in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require further research," says Grönberg.
Based on Heila's performance, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosives are being trained in the future.
Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
The training of the Heila puppy is coordinated by Customs dog school in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also goes to the police and Defence Forces experts to train with Heila.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decides which smells Heila is taught to identify.
Heil will be further trained whenever necessary," says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Customs' six drug dogs, as well as the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador retriever Heila has been selected from a litter of ten puppies.
The selection criteria of the dog selected for the airport include briskness and hunting drive, as well as calmness because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntio's home, is a close colleague of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can't go anywhere without Heila at home. Suntio laughs.
Subtle orders go to Heila to know about the one-off.
The evening cameraman loses the camera cover for the fast dog, but Heila returns the soft toy guard immediately from the "irti" command.
Hard competition for working dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
Level tests are still ahead, the next October, which will assess whether the training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heilan can be seen on duty at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come and iron a dog wearing a work vest, reminds Suntio.
The cost of one working dog is approximately EUR 60000 to 70000 per year for customs.
Their working age is approximately seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to the care of their owner.
Working days may be long, from eight to ten hours, but active participations only last from ten minutes to two hours.
The owner of work dogs is a fierce competition in Customs.
The owner of Heila applied for approximately 20-30 Customs employees.
Lucky hit Suntio, who has never had a working dog before, but he has years of experience with dogs and surveillance duties in Customs.
The Mini State got its first Olympic medal - the people get the day off
The Olympic gold of Fiji, with less than a million inhabitants, in rugby, is valued so high in the country that the government has decreed August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the country's public service, the Fijian Government confirmed the case once the championship was completed.
The day off is the day after the team's return.
There will also be celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
Fiji's rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country followed the finals in Suva, the capital, where the stadium had been erected.
Normally only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them cheering," said Fiji Times journalist Maikele Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish prodigy fainted after a wild performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt at 175 kilos after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature for lifters.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has fainted many times.
No one's ever really said why.
In Rio, Tokola scored 175 kilos and 145 kilos for the rapture.
His combined score was 200 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his last push of 175 kilos, as did the other.
In the third attempt, the weights rose with the wild roaring.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury approved the withdrawal.
The joy of a Finnish buyer was echoed by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired a virola attacker Prosan - Veikkausliiga - EveningSanomat
The Rovaniemi Ball Society, playing at the Men's Football League, has concluded a long-term contract with Estonian attacker Albert Prosa at the end of the season.
We are looking for a top player in our team with power and a small threshold for coming to Finland and Rovaniemi.
Over ten players and I went through more than 50 players from all over the world.
Gradually Prosa, Coach Juha Malinen of RoPS, began to stand out as a good alternative.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flora in Tallinn, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosan is scheduled to be with RoPS on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemi people meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new attacker when Alexander Kokko, goalmaster of last season, moved to Australia.
The brave Modern Family star shrugs again: teenage star shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, the kindly Alex Dunphy of the Modern Family Comedy series, is once again blowing by showing off her gorgeous body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also his ass.
Recently, 18-year-old Winter has attracted attention by making his style and behavior considerably bolder.
The star has posed in his social media photos in very few clothes and took numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very scarce clothes.
Recently, Winter, on the threshold of adulthood, has also published several images of himself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can watch it from here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has radically changed his image.
In this case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter was undergoing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television almost his whole life and has grown up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more you show the surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has upset some of his long-term fans with his image change.
It is not difficult to guess where he will be in ten years' time, when the decline is already so severe," says one woman on Winter's Instagram.
Some of the women's fans, on the other hand, defend the actor and urge them to ignore criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what anyone else says.
You're an inspiration to a lot of women, an inspiration to a young woman.
The Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted by northern lights: In the autumn it is possible to see a fairy-tale Mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract Japanese people to start the northern fire trips from early autumn," says Visit Finland in a press release.
The main destinations for Japanese northern fire tourism are Inari and Levi.
Northern lights are the trump cards of our winter travel, and they are strongly associated with the winter of the heart and snowy landscapes.
Lapland's winter aurora trips are in great demand, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Lights Bay starts early in the autumn and continues well into the spring.
In autumn it is possible to see the so-called Mirror aurora, where the lake's surface reflects the northern lights, making the vision two times fairy tales," says Anne Lind, Acting Marketing Manager of Visit Finland.
The main target group of Visit Finland's northern fire campaign is the wealthy Japanese women aged 25-35 who live in the city and dream about tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising, among other things.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and universities in Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among Japanese people compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like clearer unique sights from Finland, and Lind says that the northern lights have enormous potential.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists have grown clearly more in Finland than in other Nordic countries.
Last year they spent more than twice as many nights in Finland as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are an interesting target group for Finnish tourism, as they spent over EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent EUR 183 per day in Finland," Lind says.
Britain settles for rugbyhope as Fid's master class leads to gold
Great Britain's impressive progress in the rugby tournament collapsed to Fiji's final challenge at Thursday night's finals when the team suffered a 43-7 crushing defeat at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji organized a master class in handling, chewing, evasive, supporting games, running lines, and pure force in winning gold - their first Olympic medal.
The defeat was accompanied by a reasonable consolation of the silver medal - the third of Britain's day - and they were proud of their hard work in the Olympic rugby tournament, where they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
Earlier in the same day, the hard 7-5 victory of the semifinals from South Africa could have bothered them in the finals.
But despite this, Fidi would have won a top 15 team in this condition.
It may be possible - but probably not - for Britain to be comforted by the fact that at least one Britishman will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fid's head coach is Ben Ryan, former British boss of Wimbledon.
It's been quite a trip for Great Britain.
Eight years ago, coached by Ryan, they lost every game in Adelaide's tournament.
This is where they lost only one.
This beating hurts, but the development is startling.
Fidi started off excellently, rejecting British tackles for fun.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, this was like running into moving buses, and the world champions ran 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived in an angle into the finish area.
With four minutes in the clock, Jerry Tuwain's second touchdown on the right side led to a goal kick.
120, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant tackle stopped the man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from making a third goal, but it was just a slow-down for Fid.
At seven minutes, Jasa Veremvala scored a goal at the right angle, and Britain was losing 17 to 7.
Nakarawa scored again for a new start, and there was still more than a minute left in the clock... from the first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou crashed through Britain's loose tackles and rushed to the line to score.
After the landslide, the situation on the break was 29-0.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while Great Britain was just learning the game.
And that's actually the way it is.
Great Britain made wholesale changes during the break that blocked Fid's dam... for a whole four minutes, which, compared to the first half, was good until Joshua Tuisova scored the goal after Fid's impressive feed game.
Dan Norton scored for Great Britain when he scored the touchdown in the left corner and narrowed the situation to 36-7, but the game had long been lost to South Sea islanders whose supporters sang, waved flags and danced in the audiences.
It was hard not to admire Fid's joyful approach.
Mata Viliame at his last-minute goal had a frosting on Fid's cake that didn't need frosting.
The whistle was whistled, the Fijians hugged, and Britain fell on the grass, completely defeated.
Earlier that day, Fidi had beaten Japan in the semifinals of 20-5, and Britain won South Africa in a tight semifinal where both scored one goal - Britain's goal kick solved the game.
Kyle Brown took South Africa to the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with dazzling footwork and scored under the goalposts in the second half.
A mighty late-night tackle by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of England's 15-side rugby team, secured victory and finally a silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer engulfed Helen Glover and Heather Stanning in a rowing victory.
There will be no more emotional gold in these games, and that really means something.
From the first bet to the last, 220 tough touches towards history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment in Estaci da Lagoa.
Even though they rowed together, there were three votes on the boat. Coach Robin Williams' echo was present the whole time when the two of them raced for their second consecutive Olympic gold in a couple's competition - the first women in Britain's sports history books to achieve such achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance unbeatable, which is also record.
This is what we see, two brilliant athletes gliding on the surface with a swan's grace, not a complete picture of the nature of victory.
In the background of each rowing gold is a group of helpful pair of hands that gradually promote the things that matter, and no pair of hands was as essential as a coach who, 30 months ago after having a cancer diagnosis, did not know if he would live to this day.
As he said, the situation was close.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be cut, and they performed surgery.
If they don't operate, it'll spread everywhere.
It could have been pretty bad.
It'll change your way of thinking a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The triplet was lucky to be able to start his treatment at the beginning of 2014 outside the season, when they caused as little disturbance as possible - if that expression can ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to heal quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and I walked around the ward 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing itself is a journey, but that makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, Williams, who had had a nervous morning, was the first thought of the couple, and he had spoken a little more than usual, trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, an experienced captain of the Royal Artillery regiment in Afghanistan, said: "I've been an emotional wreck this week, which may be a little overreacting, but this means so much to me."
It just highlights how important this is to me, how hard me and Helen and Robin have worked.
The past three years with Helen and Rob have been awesome.
If it weren't for Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so he deserves a big thank you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better internship or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost the competition in five years.
The couple set a rough rhythm that their rivals couldn't reach.
Even at the last 500 metres, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in storage.
We were very attached to the moment.
Helen yelled, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important to have control.
We had a good start, and we didn't try to do anything special at the same time.
We weren't looking for fireworks today, we were just looking for a good rowing and winning the race, and that's what we did.
A couple of them are waiting a year before they decide on their future.
Glover's gonna be at the wedding next month when he gets married to TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last race.
It would have put too much pressure on you.
After London it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed out.
It lasted about four minutes here.
This feels so much better," he said.
Iceland will change the government wallowing in Panama leaks
Iceland will hold the early parliamentary elections in October, which are already required by the protesters enraged by the Panama data leaks in the spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed that a number of Icelandic politicians used tax havens to circumvent taxes.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but that was not enough for the demonstrators.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn at that time.
The election day has now been decided on October 29th.
Analysts say it is difficult to predict how much the people's last spring rage will affect the election results of the autumn.
In June, the presidential elections showed a clear critical attitude towards those in power, and Gudni Johannessson, who was elected from outside politics, was elected president.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of Isis.
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump withdrew his latest chatter.
He said that he was sarcastic in claiming that President Barack Obama, who was sitting, would be the founder of the terrorist organisation Isis and democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, who was involved in setting up the organisation.
The Democratic Party was furious with the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
You should never let anyone who can sink so low, Clinton tweeted.
In the south of France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of a burkini bathing suit favored by Muslims on the beaches, reports among other things the British Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that access to beaches and swimming is prohibited for all who do not have a bathing suit that respects good manners and secularism.
The decision also states that bathing suits which exaggerately express religious connections can increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating French National Day.
At the end of July, two extremists connected to ISIS attacked a church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
The quality of swimming waters in the Oulu region passed through the sieve - Pyyykösjärvi's blue algae moss
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only blue algae debris has been observed on Lake Pyyykösjärvi's bathing area.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environmental Action took water samples from nine EU beaches in the Oulu Region and 30 other public bathing areas.
Apart from Meriniemi beach, the concentrations of E. coli and gastro-intestinal enterococcal bacteria in all bathing waters in all bathing areas were below the limits laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The water concentrations of E. coli and enterococci were confirmed on Wednesday, when the bacterial concentrations had fallen below the action limits.
The blue algae ooze found on the shore of Lake Pyyykösjärvi does not yet make the water unswimable, but under favourable conditions the situation can quickly turn into a blue algae bloom, creating blue green algae on the water surface in boards.
The environmental action will monitor the situation with frequent inspections.
If the blue algae mold turns into blue algae bloom, this will also be reported separately on the bathing area's notice board.
See here for the results of the bathing water samples.
MTK's Hakkarainen forest gift reduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside
Forest gift reduction is one tax change in the Ministry of Finance's draft budget for next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax deduction to be granted on the basis of a gift tax on the generational change of forest holding.
The Ministry of Finance's proposal to reduce forest gifts has four objectives: to promote the generational changes of forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase forest space size and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
A forest owner would reduce the pure capital income of forestry.
The idea of making such a tool to promote the generational changes of forest farms is good in general," comments Juha Hakkarainen, Chief Forest Officer of the Federation of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, Mr Hakkarainen finds something to criticise in the motion for a change in taxes.
The forest gift reduction is presented to the forest owner for pure capital income.
It is capital income minus all other deductions.
MTK and Hakkarainen consider that the effectiveness of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the sales income of wood.
The VM's proposal assumes that a reduction in the pure capital income of forestry will prevent the loss of the capital income of forestry from being deducted from other taxes.
Such a person would gain a tax advantage even if he didn't sell wood.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner cannot perceive it," says Hakkarainen.
In addition, he said that only a small number of forest owners are concerned.
The limit on the tax deduction linked to the yield value of the forest is EUR 40 000.
He thinks it's too high.
As such, he says, it eliminates 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners from the scope of the reduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10 percent of the forest ownership," he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of increasing the size of the farm.
According to Hakkarainen, the reduction in forest gifts has been dragged into forest policy for decades.
It is driven by the ageing of the forest-owners.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful hailstorm surprised the drivers at Himanga - two cars went into a ditch and bumped into each other
There was a special retreat on Kalajoki Himanga on Friday morning.
According to the Rescue Department, two cars driven in a row fell into a ditch, after which the one behind crashed after the driver.
According to the on-call firemaster Harri Tipper, derailment is suspected to have been caused by a severe hailing.
There were two people in the car behind, both of whom were transported to the hospital for medical treatment.
There's no further information on their injuries.
The driver of the car driving the above was not injured.
An accident occurred on Highway 8 from Himanga a few kilometers to Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments.
The findings of the Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska's research team show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases the malignantness of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of cancer could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue around the cancer to the normal soft tissue.
In the future, it may be possible to improve the effectiveness of anticancer medications by focusing on the interaction between the cells and the surrounding tissue.
The results of the study have been published on 4 August in the prestigious magazine Nature Communications in the field of cell biology.
Muhos's family homicide continues at court, the prosecutor demands a murder sentence for another perpetrator.
The threshing of Muhos' family homicide continues at court for both convicted.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for a family homicide in Muhos.
One received eight years for four months for killing and aggravated robbery, among other things, as a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The convicted person was also convicted of aggravated endangerment of road safety as a young person and of driving a vehicle without rights as a young person.
The district court's judgment was appealed by the prosecutor, the plaintiffs and the man who was sentenced more severely.
The prosecutor demands that a man who has been punished with a lesser sentence be sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder committed as a young person.
At the time of the act, they were in full agreement.
According to the District Court, 17-year-old young men killed a man who worked as a counselor for the Child Welfare Unit at a school in July last year.
A 17-year-old who was convicted of murder attacked a director from behind on the couch in the living room.
The director had gotten out of hand and trampled the young one into his room when one of the young ones hit him with a vacuum tube.
Among other things, the director was strangled, beaten, and kicked in the head.
According to the state of mind survey, both convicted persons were fully in agreement at the time of the act.
According to the court, young people had planned to escape from the family home, at least since the day before.
The ice shark is the world's longest-lived vertebrate, increasing only at 156 years of age.
The longest living vertebrate in the world has been confirmed by an ice shark," says a study published in Science magazine.
In the north of the Atlantic, such as the ice shark that swims around Greenland, or holkeri, can live up to 400 years old.
The female doesn't reproduce until she's 156.
The life span of an ice shark is increased by the fact that it only grows one inch a year.
Only one species of bivalve molluscs are known to live longer than an ice shark.
Scientists discovered age by radiocarbon timing.
Because of nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive traces.
They enabled scientists to estimate the age of sharks.
An elder's age was estimated to be 392 years - although throwing one way or another could be as much as 120 years.
Donald Trump as an economic wizard - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need anything else in the world.
Up to one third of the State's total tax revenue would not be received if the change in corporate tax promoted by Donald Trump were implemented.
Tax revenue would also be reduced, especially with tax reliefs that benefit the richest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it on Monday in Detroit.
The company tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
There would be an enormous amount of money uncollected, a thousand billion dollars a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39,6, after the discount offered by Trump 33.
The inheritance tax would be abolished altogether.
Trump accused the state of overregulation of business and of bankrupting small businesses.
The environmental standards that have been decided upon must be renewed and energy regulation abolished.
The health reform of Barack Obama must be re-examined.
The administration must be appointed "experts instead of bureaucrats."
According to Trump, "destructive" trade policy is one of the main causes of the US problems.
Free trade agreements would be terminated.
Imports from China would be taxed at 45% and Mexico at 35%.
We're offering you a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our creed," Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes will unite cities, American ships will control the seas, American steel will raise new skyscrapers throughout the country.
Unlike their customs, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by the assistants, even though it was interrupted 14 times by well - organized protests.
Economists - including those close to the Republicans - see the Trump programme taking the United States into a deep economic downturn.
Hillary Clinton released her own program early on Friday in Finland time.
An Attack from the Past - People's News
The sea is bewildering fatally, but the actual tidal wave strikes in the middle of Madrid's street traffic - accounting with the past can begin.
That's the essence of Pedro Almodóvar's new story.
Almodovar's previous steering work Travel lovers (2013) was a funny satirical comedy on the ronski side, the pre-Season where I live (2011) as a Spanish artist.
On a level basis, Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between the two works.
It is the serene love, relationship, and family drama of a conciliatory woman whose focus is the relationship between mother and daughter.
The story is simple and seen as a long flashback.
Life seems to be in line with the middle-aged name person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of the occasional encounter, the new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) may be amazed to the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julie times the stages of her life to her adult daughter.
He begins with the time before his daughter was born, the moments when he met his future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, the young teacher of Julieta, will take up the second female lead, a TV familiar from the series Ommelte time (2013-2014).
Julieta's ageing has been dealt with in a way that can be regarded as a lump, but I would say that it is quite cleverly and literally a single wipe.
The Almodóvar films are often so marked by brittleness, up to humor in Julieta.
It is an even - powerfully played, restrained, in some places a good musical movie, and quite saddened, with the elements of elegance.
On the other hand, the visual saturation typical of the Spanish director is still present and begins to poke the eye in a pure form rather than a functioning dramatic power.
People in the film are afflicted by sickness, death, or just sudden losses, but the surface remains equally Korean.
This is particularly true of clothing: in the case of a name person, the costumes change from one scene to another, and the same applies to visible earrings.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main point, i.e. the tunes of the scene in question, do not improve in particular.
Mechanically, the impression is outward and slightly inanimate.
Almodóvar has written a script based on the three novels of Alice Munro, a Nobel Prize winner in Canada in 2013.
The novels have been published in Vankulainen: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in the writing production of some flat-rate literature.
Emotionally, there would have been more than enough material for drama, so much of the big things - especially the gnawing guilt - in the movie's theatrics.
Control and script: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on Alice Munro's three novels.
Starring Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The opening night of the film is 12.8.
The government is trying to win the election - People's News
No further cuts will be made, the glaring ministers, so that the basic Finns will not completely collapse.
However, the cuts decided in the spring are being made by a lot of people.
There won't be any more surgeries.
The four billion savings already decided will be enough.
This is how Prime Minister Juha Sipilä and Minister of Finance Petteri Orphano (Econ.) are convinced under the budget line.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM's proposal, since the cuts in social security were already decided at the spring framework.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index are cut by 0.85%.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment benefit is reduced from 500 to 400.
The training surgeries continue.
Municipal elections haunting
Why do ministers insist so strongly on the fact that no further cuts are made on them?
Because next year is an election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and are the most important thermometer in the parliamentary term, not polls.
In the past, it has been seen that the results of the municipal election that takes the government parties in different directions spoil the atmosphere of the government for a long time.
The polls, however, say that the government party's basic Finns are facing a smudge loss, although the result of its previous elections was modest at 12.3% compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns of Basic Finland received 752 new delegates, most of which next spring will realise the cost of influencing the right-wing government.
The lifeline of the government of three parties of about equal size depends on the perks of the Finns.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted for the party had had enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's fermentation have also surfaced.
There will be no further cuts, firstly by blurring the fact that next year they will be made violently and secondly by trying to soften the waiting blow for the Finns.
Big surgery in 2018?
In a year, everything will probably be different... if Sipilä's government is still standing.
The government has set itself the goal of retiring debt during this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orphano's draft budget will next year be EUR 5.9 billion in debt, which is more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to get your hands up in the middle of the parliamentary term and to admit that the government is unable to comply with its own programme: the debt will not break down or even slow down.
The other is sticking to the program.
It means new even harder cuts on top of the previous ones in the 2017 budget run.
The budget would be run at least close to balance during 2018 and then in spring the parliamentary elections will receive what comes next.
These measures will not allow debt to be reduced.
It is quite clear that the current measures do not allow debt to fall, even though Juha Sipilä is trying to stimulate a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäki at the briefing of the budget prove this irresistibly:
World economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. the international economy will not become a veto.
The Finnish economy has hardly risen since the collapse in 2008, except during the temporary recovery policy in the beginning of the 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% in this decade and has prolonged from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion more per year than in 2008.
On the curves presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60% threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt recovery presented by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost around EUR 6 billion, which will in practice be covered entirely by new debt.
This is the idea of the Centre, the Coalition Party and the Basic Finns as to what is responsible.
Question: People want to leave a lot of tasks to municipalities
Three out of four consider that the organisation of day care for children, youth work and physical activity is the responsibility of the municipality, as shown in a study by the KAKS - Municipal Foundation.
A clear majority of the population will also pass responsibility to individual municipalities for libraries, culture, civic studies, building supervision, upper secondary school education and waste management.
The province, for its part, is most likely to be responsible for regional planning, special care, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for people with disabilities.
None of the tasks entrusted to municipalities are to be transferred to the State.
At the end of the chase, a minor drunk driver ran away from the police.
Joensuu's 16-year-old motorcycle driver drove from a police patrol in Joensuu on Ilomantssintie on Friday night at half past one.
A police patrol tried to stop a motorcycle without lights, but a young man took off driving the police at a fair speed.
The chase continued to the Sonkajanrantie, from which still to the Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drifted off the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but a faster - legged policeman ran to catch the fugitive.
The breath test performed on the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a driver's license to drive a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, among other things, as a serious endangerment of road safety.
A truck in a rock truck crashed in a ditch.
A truck in a rock truck crashed in a ditch on Lake Polvijärvi at 9.15 p.m. on Thursday night.
The truck had drifted left in a curved bend out of the road and fell on its side in a ditch.
The rescue department pulled the injured driver out of the crashed truck through the door above, together with the emergency helicopter staff and paramedics.
It was left to the car owner to lift the vehicle.
From a fallen truck, hydraulic oil spilled onto the road that the rescue department absorbed into the turf.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared this afternoon at the Ilmajoki River.
Since this afternoon, an 87-year-old woman has been missing in Lahti village in Ilmajoki, South Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for a woman about five inches long, slim, and good - posture with white hair that extends under her jaw.
Observations and tips on the missing person's movements are requested to call the tip number 0295440513 of the Ostrobothnia Situation Centre.
The elements of a major accident in the air - look at the picture gallery about the damage to the Parafest
The crash flow that knocked down the tents of the Parafest Festival caused massive damage.
Arto Pepperi, president of the Parafest Association of Joensuu, estimates that the festival will get on its feet financially, and the event can also be held next year.
Kalle Salonen, the last performer of the parafest, performed at the market stage at the end of Friday night.
On Saturday, the program will continue with performances at the city theater premises starting at 1 pm.
The art center in Ahja has a Parafest exhibition between 1:00 and 3:00 p.m.
The programme will be organised as planned.
When rainwater and its weight trigger a falling air flow, the flow is generated in a lightning cloud.
The changes in the shape of the water in the thunderstorm bind the heat, and so the falling air mass cools down and its speed toward the earth accelerates.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that several crashes occur in Finland during the summer.
It's hard to predict the route of the surges.
The crash flow struck the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum at the scene of Parafest on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents were overturned, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
In the accident, four persons were slightly injured.
There was one child in the group who was transported with a slight injury to follow-up treatment.
Air Pollution Ages Londoners
According to the study, Londoners' skin age faster than usual.
The cause of skin ageing is air pollution.
The British study is reported by Evening Standard.
British skin care company Caci analyzes the most toxic particulate matter in London air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that many retired Londoners have two and a half years older skin than, for example, those who live in rural areas.
Small particles that age the skin are very fine dust pollution from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, kill almost 9 500 Londoners each year.
Studies have shown that particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac's study found that early ageing is a risk, especially for Londoners who walk around crowded streets on their way to work.
London residents may try to protect themselves against air pollution, for example, with different masks, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
The tractor's brakes failed... pushed the man standing in front.
The man had moved stones in his yard on a tractor.
After he got out of the tractor and went in front of it, the brakes of the tractor failed and the tractor ran over the man.
The man was not hit by it, but the tractor was able to push the man enough to be transported to the central hospital for further research, seriously injured.
The tractor couldn't run any further because it bumped into the rocks in front of it.
A new strife for the coming season
The Joensuu League-Riento, playing at the volleyball Championship, will start with a series of better starting points than male memory.
The team's been together for almost three weeks now.
The common tone can be found with certainty better than in previous periods, when the beginnings of the series have been gloomy for Rieno.
Jani Säsä, who continues as the head coach of the run-up, says that the new team is enterprising and united.
Fred Musoni, the middle fighter of the foreign trio, starts his second season in Rieno.
The new face is a 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson on the Rwandan national team is a six-inch picker.
Garchet's a passer, the Brazilian has a measure of 198 centimeters.
Through Josba, Kataja and River Boys to the US national team
Anne Jumpkinen has played at almost all the World Championship Championships since 2003.
Now Tampere is already in the sixth race, only 2013 missed after Canada was better at North American qualifying.
I worked in Turku and played with women there when I noticed the announcement.
U.S.A. was setting up a national team for the salibandy.
I got interested, and here we are, Jumpinen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York City in Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was a year old.
In 1987, Jumpanen reached the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, there wasn't a sport like that played at SM level yet like a salibandy.
The e-mail was played in college.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in Jokipoj I played hockey in the Finnish Championship, Jumpinen remembers.
Jumppanen played the Finnish Championship series with the university in 1991-92, the following three seasons passed in Josba.
In addition to playing, he coached the club for the A-girls championship.
Women's Finnish Championship career culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumpkinen played in the Finnish Women's Championship series through 10, with a balance of 169 matches 51+34=85.
The most recent Finnish Championship period is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tattu Väänänen were appointed to the national team
Joensuu's club, Josban, was raised by Perttu Puska and Enola-based Tatu Väänänen was selected to join the Finnish national team, playing at the Czech Brno EFT tournament on November 6-8.
In Helsinki, the attacking 25-year-old Perttu Puska has played this game before six men's ground games where he has accumulated a total power score of 9+4=13.
The 32-year-old defender of the Swiss Wiler-Ersigen, Tatu Väänänen, has recovered from the femur and is part of the regular team's standard equipment with 117 ground games experience.
The national team was also named Mika Kohonen, the conqueror of the Seinäjoki Gambling Brothers, who was last seen in the Finnish T-shirt at the World Cup last December.
Petri Kettunen, from the Gulf of Kontio, is the main coach of the Salibandymaa team.
Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM gold is missing in the prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is quitting as a beach volley player at least temporarily after the current season.
Beach volley Finnish championships will be decided this weekend at Kouvola Sports Park.
During three days, medals are played in a series of adults and young people.
In cooperation with Kouvola Volleyballers and the Finnish Volleyball Association, the top six pairs of each series will qualify for the Finnish Championship final tournament.
The local color of the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, raised by Elimäki NMKY, who has been a member of Finland's beach volley peaks for several years now.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to playing games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get to the audience this weekend.
I'm sure there's a great arena coming to the nest stadium.
I haven't played in the adult series very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals at home," Hasu feels.
The Kouvola region lit the Hasu spark for sport and gave good food for a fine hobby.
There's a lot of memories of childhood in mind.
I started volleyball when I was nine years old in the E-girls of Elimäe NMKY.
The top of the mind is too big a jersey, knee shields rotating in the ankles, and huge ace screams and choreography after the point," Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The group spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were heavily involved - the teammate's father coached us and our mother was the chairman of the club for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volleyy was a natural choice of species in return for an indoor volleyball.
There's been a song played at the Kierrälampi beach since the 1990s.
At the kukski, activity has always been active.
I also went to see the juniors' Finnish Championship sectionals myself, thinking that one day I'd be out there playing.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays together with Anniina Parkkinen at the Finnish Championship Finals this weekend.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second tough two in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We still haven't got the prize closet, Hasu throws mysteriously.
The weekend in Kouvola may be the last one for Hasu in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges are awaited in the field of civilian work.
Yes, the international career is over after the tournament at Kisakallio.
By the way, the toes are put on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu is planning.

Salomon Koli boldly went into farming
Agriculture as an entrepreneur means risk taking, sweat and energy.
A young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became a farmer because he believes in a positive future also in rural areas.
Soon two years ago, Koli, together with his younger brother, Valtteri Koli, began working as a successor to their home space.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises the brothers in his own experience.
Beginning as a rural entrepreneur meant taking debt and increasing the size of the space so that bread could come into hand from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always been happy at the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I've put it all on the line.
If you start something, I think it needs to be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we set out to build a garden house, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
However, I was very boldly involved in the project, and I have been fully involved in it," says Koli of Solomon, adding that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything would still be good.
Solomon Koli, who grows cattle, aims to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has been successful, as Salomon Koli has been selected as the top ten in the competition for young food producers in Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible victory.
He can be voted on the magazine's website until 21.8.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest figure for years (after June 2012) and the first figure above zero after October last year, when positive 0.2% was reported.
The annual average inflation, measured by the cost-of-living index, was -0.8% (August 2015 - July 2016), compared with the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
In July 2016, the Cost-of-living Index was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
From the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) the inflation rate has been -0.2% and annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, an increase in the price of the following consumer goods was observed: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household supplies and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained on level with the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat's "anime" effect is rated as Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, the anime has been an inspiration to the filter, but some observers say it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat enables about 150 million daily users to shape reality and play with identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a figure suitable for Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lens are simple, facial - trait - twisting tools that produce over 30 million improved selfies a day.
All missteps quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat's lenses have been criticized in the past with accusations that the application advertises a blackface mask or favours bleached skin color as a beauty ideal.
So this week when Snapchat advertised to some users a lens that gave them crooked eyes, crooked teeth and chubby cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - yellowface.
And they wondered if these repeated polemics could be a sign of the company's greater problem of diversity.
News and resentment spread widely on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day later Snapchat said that he had disbanded the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant as a tribute to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asians.
But for racist observers, the lens was a reminder of the offensive stereotypes in action.
Others vehemently denied anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet of photographs was widely distributed, said in her e-mail that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable."
He added that "it is difficult to argue against a comparison, which is adjacent to the gross Asian caricature and filter effects."
It shows that the filter is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face taken to extreme contempt.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be caught up in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and equipment that we all carry in our hands.
And the vast audience of young people more diverse than their parents in race may mean that they are even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
In an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates an insulting image, "for these guys it's much harder to be inconspicuous than before."
On Thursday Zhu, Product Manager and Engineer working for Medium, decided to remove his Snapchat account and invited others to do the same.
In his essay for Medium and telephone interview, he said that he believed that racial disputes reflected the lack of diversity in Snapchat's pay practices.
Zhu mainly criticized the company's white male leadership and finished his essay with hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#DeleteSnapchat)
"They either do not have a diverse representation of different skin colors on their staff, which is why they are able to make decisions of this kind," said Zhu, Chinese-American, "or they have different skin colors at work, but they are not in positions where they feel safe or could speak out."
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint to which Snapchat has largely failed to respond.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff, pointing out its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial background of his staff, but the representative said that the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and to advance internal inclusion efforts.
Zhu, for his part, said that he kept his Snapchat account closed, adding: "Is it really the case that they actually need more users like us to say that this is not okay?"
According to the Congressional Panel, military officials were perverting Isis intelligence.
In a report published on Thursday, the Congressional Panel said that intelligence reports from the U.S. military headquarters had been edited by the authorities to present a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than were justified by events on the ground.
The interim report by the Republican Chairman of the Defence Forces Committee of the Chamber of Representatives, the Intelligence Committee and the sub-committee on Defense Allowances identified "widespread dissatisfaction" among the intelligence analysts at headquarters who said that the superiors tampered with their estimates of American efforts to defeat Isis.
The headquarters, known as Centcom, is a military military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The findings of intelligence accepted by senior Centcom leaders typically gave a more positive picture of US counter-terrorism efforts than the facts on the ground justified, which were normally more positive than the analyses produced by other intelligence community authors," said the press release.
"The events in Centcom are unacceptable - our fighters in war suffer when bad analyses are presented to high-ranking decision-makers," said Ken Calvert, a Republican of California.
Centcom's management failures reach the very top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the constant problems with the headquarter descriptions and analyses of the U.S. efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide clear evidence that the high-ranking administrative authorities of the Obama regime have ordered reports to be tampered with, it describes analysts as feeling as if Centcom's leaders had put pressure on them to describe the threat posed by the Islamic state, Isis, in a more positive light.
"For the first half of 2015, many of the headquarters press releases, statements and certificates to Congress were far more positive than the events themselves," said the report.
For example, Centcom's authority publicly stated that a major attack to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still in Isis' possession.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear," Mr Mike Pompeo, a Republican of Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the top intelligence leaders of the U.S. Armed Forces Armed Forces Headquarters manipulate the outputs of headquarters intelligence in order to minimize the threat of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans created a working group after having heard that analysts had raised concerns about the manipulation of intelligence data from the Islamic state.
The report published on Thursday will be followed by more extensive results while the investigation is ongoing.
The Chief Inspector of the Department of Defense has initiated an extraordinary ongoing investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, the members of the Chamber of Representatives' intelligence committee published their own findings which were in agreement with some conclusions of the Republican working group.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a unnecessarily isolated process between intelligence assessments of Isis and Iraqi security forces," said Adam B. Schiff, the committee's leading democrat, in the opinion.
According to Schiff, this process "prolonged the publication of intelligence outputs," weakened the mood among analysts and did not "give enough room for differing perspectives."
Schiff and the Democrats said that they did not find any evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to reconcile their conclusions with 'pre-set or political narrative'.
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday on the preliminary findings of the Congressional investigation.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon Chief Inspector has started an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Commander Patrick Evans, a representative of the Pentagon, said in his statement that the Department of Defense did not comment on the Congressional report as long as the Chief Inspector's investigation was ongoing.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential issues of national security."
The study has other repercussions than the question of whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria are successful (as the increasing number of defence authorities are now claiming).
Last year's accusations questioned how much President Obama can count on the headquarters to provide honest assessments of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other areas of crisis.
The criticism of Islamic state intelligence reflects the controversy over a decade ago when the Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote an article saying that despite the protests of several analysts, President George W. Bush's regime supported a small army in Iraq and took very little time to consider the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion regarding the intelligence of the Islamic state.
According to the authorities, last year the Hooker group concluded that despite the contrary public statements, air strikes against the Islamic state-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's economy because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil through the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery was not reported outside headquarters.
The then Centcom commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, began to be criticised last year after many legislators regarded his testimony to the Senate as an overly positive estimate of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins for the fourth time in a row in women's field hockey, organising a showdown with Britain
Day after having scored three goals in the team winning Japan 6-1, Katie Bam scored Thursday in the US women's field hockey team with the first two goals for Americans winning India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he wasn't sure if he had done the same thing before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps track of his paints."
But he knows this: the Americans are in a 4-0-way at the Olympic tournament and they share their group's first place with Britain, which was still unbeatable after winning Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have made it to the quarterfinals, and this game determines who will take first place and who will take second place in their team of six teams.
First to avoid a strong Netherlands, the leader of the second group, a little longer at the start of the quarter finals.
No matter how Saturday's game ends, the Americans have stirred up with their surprising success here, four years after they were last on the 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up at the Blue Bell of Pennsylvania and picked up a hockey bat for the first time when he was three years old (his older twin sisters played the game at Drexel) in connection with the national team at 16, when he became the youngest player of all time.
He wasn't involved in the 2008 Olympics because he couldn't get on the final player list.
In 2012, nothing went well for him and his teammates.
The following year Craig Parnham of England was appointed coach, and things began to change.
"Culture change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the same pace of work in London as we do now.
We've turned around.
Thursday night, Bam started the first half of goalmaking with a crash close to goal.
India had come into the game with no victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the situation 1-0 high until the end of the third period, when Bam took over.
He carried the ball for a long time on the left side of the field, then circled into the center and tossed the ball to the finish line, taking the Americans to the 2-0 line.
Melissa Gonzalez added the fourth round in the middle of the final goal.
This zero game was the first U.S. goaltender to Jackie Briggs to score one goal in each of the first three wins.
He's in a good mood.
So is Bam.
"We have a good situation now," Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Trampolin peace in the midst of the Olympic race
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, the Olympic Games are in progress.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be a constant and inevitable message of fierce competition and effort.
It's like the Olympic torch itself is a flaming baton passed on from the archer to the swimmer and the gymnast to the triathlonist.
It is impossible to turn on television, read a newspaper, or listen to a neighbor's conversation in line at a café without hearing about the hatred between Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, a first-time and future heartbreaker with a smile pit at the Olympics, could well be one of the names known to everyone who is presented at the best viewing time and supported by sponsorship agreements and good-mind TV ads - if he were a swimmer, gymnastic or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28 from the California Lake Forest, competes for Olympic gold in a trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all species as much.
Farther from the center, partly in the shade, are the species that are not generally accepted by everyone: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We always have a breast swim. Long live it.
But if I may make a moderate number of my special favorites, I would like to draw attention to the temperate attraction of trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it made its first appearance in the Sydney Games, there are so few comments in the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed did not realize that it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could be a regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the sport, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete did not go to the finals until 2012.
Chinese and Russians usually share men's, Chinese and Canadian women's medals.
This year, China's Dong Dong and Canada's Rosie McLenna are defending the gold medal in London.
However, the trampoline is accompanied by a certain charm to the underdog, partly because the uncivilized ear sounds better suited to clown school than to the Olympics.
Here I have to confess that I'm not an expert, I'm just a fan of the airless.
There are opportunities for amusing, as is noted by the vividness of the endless bounces of cartoon films, but there is also the grace of gymnastics and diving, two species that it basically combines.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means a springboard.
Those seeking to win the championship jumped up to nearly 30 feet with a giant trampoline, and they had to perform rolling motion series (turns, folds and volts) and finally land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed on the basis of implementation, difficulty and "flight time."
There are 32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women competing in Rio.
The most common direction for the Olympic Games is straight ahead.
Those wishing for medal must go further, faster, up and over - sometimes to the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
They not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in televised news, another scornful line: the world record or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable and even fanatical - and it can even make a viewer cry.
But that is also the reason why watching the games can be a bit exhausting.
The trampoline offers a resting moment here.
Trampoline's heading up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The competitor rises again, seemingly weightless as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Of course, there is no lack of competition or difficulty, but during the program there is no fierce rush towards the end, no jumps into the distance, just a dreamy, smooth interruption of time and gravity.
It's as close to the Zen space as the Olympics can get.
Women's qualifiers and then the finals will be held Friday afternoon at 1 p.m. (ET), men's races will also come Saturday at 1 p.m.
NBC will send the finals as part of their afternoon software starting at 14:00 on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic rush, they offer a quiet, charming moment that most likely will not be noticed in general chaos.
And if awareness is gained only by offering male athletes to be stared at and objectified (as men gymnastics in the United States recently suggested according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley just waits for his sighing new fandom.
"Gender Shows His Mind" in Ethiopia, a long-standing ally of the United States
Violent demonstrations in Ethiopia
The protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia have faced the violent opposition of the government.
Eyewitnesses say dozens of protesters have been shot to death in confrontations with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking?
Over the last decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a strong ally of the West, whose economy is growing rapidly.
In recent months, however, protests against the government have shaken the country as they spread to more and more regions.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed into the streets demanding profound political change.
According to human rights groups, the government's response was ruthless.
Witnesses said that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed protestors.
The spread of videos recorded in protests, which are believed to be at the end of last year or the beginning of this year, shows how the security authorities use sticks to beat young people while they were forced to stand on their hands against the wall.
The main United Nations Human Rights Authority is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"Holding this country together was always difficult, and it will be even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, Project Manager of the Horn of Africa International Crisis Group.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa, and the West appreciates its stability.
America's military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, particularly in Somalia, and hardly any African country will receive so much help from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has grown at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved extremely, and the capital city of Addis Ababa even has a new commuter train.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been the model of democracy, human rights organisations have constantly spoken of government repression, the opposition in the country has been limited and dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But this could be changing.
"If you smother people and they have no choice but to show their minds, this will happen," said Seyoum Teshome, a university teacher from Central Ethiopia.
The whole kids are showing their minds.
One generation is protesting.
The complaints are diverse and cover all the power of the coalition governing land use in the stranglehold.
After the much criticised elections last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last position held by the opposition, and now it holds all the seats in this House.
At the same time, tensions on the border with Eritrea are increasing, and the struggle along this tense and controversial border required hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, may try to exploit the turmoil and arm themselves again.
Many factors explain why, after years of turmoil, bitter feelings are now exploding.
The first seems apparently harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last few years has a large number of Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more common and internet service has improved.
Even if the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate their location via hidden network relays.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they met for demonstrations.
Secondly, Ethiopia's two largest ethnic groups, the oromos and the amharas, are better connected.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.
Very long - term amharas, mainly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, prospered in politics and business by exploiting the oromas, many of which are Muslims and who live in the lowlands.
But this, too, is changing.
"We are on our way to organizing under a single umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, the sorority leader.
The largest demonstrations have taken place in the Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many amharas and oromos think that Ethiopia is ruled unfairly by the people of the tigre. The population covers about 6% of the population and controls the armed forces, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenaw.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was the Ethiopian Prime Minister for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who saw corners around.
Analysts say that he was especially qualified to observe early signs of dissatisfaction and use secret ambassadors in making opposers harmless.
"Today's administration has no such basic instinct," said conflict analyst Abdi.
The new Ethiopian Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked relatively unfamiliar to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, who was from the tigre area of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
The analysts say that the security services controlled by the tigres don't trust him.
Many fear that this can lead to increased bloodshed.
For the last time, Ethiopia was in such turmoil in 2005, when thousands showed their minds about elections that, according to analysts, seemed to be flunked first by the government and then robbed them.
Many protesters died, albeit less than in recent months, during the crackdown, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuting train, and for considerable progress in the fight against poverty.
But clearly this has not stopped the internal disdain of the Ethiopian government.
And now it begins to take a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in the amhara city of Gondar attacked companies owned by tigres, and anti-tigre hatred becomes increasingly common in social media.
Analysts say that demonstrations put the United States and other western allies in a clumsy position.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights to neighbouring Somalia, although it recently said that it had closed this base.
Although the Western countries clearly want to support democracy, they also do not want their allies in the already unstable region to collapse.
"This," Abdi said, "is real balancing."
Donald Trump explains his Obama-Based ISIS argument as "sarcasm."
Donald J. Trump tried to stifle the dispute that overcame his latest campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious this week when he repeatedly argued that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of an Islamic terrorist group.
The report raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to communicate clearly with the American public.
It also put his defenders, who have struggled to defend him during a turbulent period, in a difficult position where they must explain remarks that he does not necessarily mean.
After an innuendo at the campaign meeting on Wednesday evening, Trump argued the same with increasing enthusiasm during Thursday's interviews, where he dared that he really intended to say that the President and Clinton created Isis.
However, in the early Friday morning Twitter publication Trump said that he was only sarcastic.
The publication was a turning point from the previous day when Trump said in several interviews that he was indeed serious about the accusation.
When Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump blink his remark by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy Isis, a Republican presidential candidate, to listen to him.
The latest criticism storm comes in a situation where Trump has tried to re-focus his campaign in the midst of economic opinion polls.
Trump and Clinton fought this week to talk about the economy in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to come back to the subject again.
Running back to Twitter, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he considered the speech boring.
Trump's used sarcasm defense before.
Late in July, when he faced wide criticism apparently when he proposed that the Russians hack Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his comments by saying "Of course I am sarcastic."
This approach will allow Trump to go to the borders of political speech and then return where necessary.
"I think it's a model in which he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He looks at how they work and then 'brows' in one direction or another depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think that he is clever about his statements and knows that they are vague enough to be filtered through several different lenses.
Instead of relaxing his speech for the large electorate, Trump has been more elegant in recent days as his popularity has continued to decline.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey, published on Friday, showed that Trump is chasing Clinton considerably in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
While Trump tends to avoid apologizing for the provocative things he has said, he often accuses his critics of misunderstanding his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
As he faces ever closer scrutiny during the last months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have forced his loyal allies into an uncomfortable position in which they must publicly support him, no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York, one of Trump's most prominent supporters, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I believe that there are real, political comments in his words," Giuliani said when asked about the truthfulness of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded an Islamic state.
It is true in the sense that before Obama, Isis was almost unknown, a small organization that he called amateur, totally wrong, and that is why it happened because he pulled troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama government, where Clinton worked as Secretary of State, allowed Isis to get worse because it failed effectively to deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Before the meetings in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued on Twitter an attack on the news media that grinds about his every word and is biased against him.
He mocked "bad, pathetic" television experts who are trying to make him clear, saying, "They're not gonna make it!"
Some democrats made fun of Trump's excuse for a new evidence that he is unfit to be president.
Previously closed café returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby, cash-only place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network, but which offered good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the street side of Bedford Avenue was too expensive for it.
The store that replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
The locals lamented it as the latest loss of the middle class in the city to be renovated.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is crushed and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is a change, it's also reinventing.
Last November, the revived Verb opened up in Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verb has a wifi and can pay with credit cards, but some of the staff is still the same and has the same unpretentious atmosphere.
Coffee's still good, too.
The new Verb is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café, who is the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started in Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.
When the customer offered to fund him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the same.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought a similar espresso machine.
It even used the lights of the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try it too.
He brought in some new ingredients.
There are bacon-egg-cheese sandwiches on the menu, and there are capsicums and browned onion on the floors.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
The cafeteria no longer serves beer, but they make fresh juices.
In nine months, Rodriguez says he's noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
"Williamsburg was too expensive for many former customers," he said.
One of these customers was Rebecca Oliveira from last Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, formerly lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he wandered into the cafeteria.
He says that when Verb closed, he gave up drinking coffee for a while.
"I understood that I enjoyed Verb's coffee and culture," he said.
Now he has returned to coffee, although that day he ordered a mixed chai potion instead of his usual iced coffee, which is one of the new additions.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, visited Verb faithfully since 2003.
He used to go there before work, and he always made the same order.
"Every day fifteen after seven, regularly as a clock, I went in and they were making my spicy bagel with butter," he said.
Photograph. Rodriguez said that he wanted to do experiments and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes his usual order, but sometimes, due to variety, he makes room for a spicy bagel with bacon, eggs and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn't hold a grudge against the soap shop that took over the old premises.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to prepare a special soap for Verb using cold coffee from the cafeteria as an ingredient.
"I think we can still take the offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also approved the café.
One of these new customers translated the menu in Polish, and Rodriguez said that he was planning to put it out on a point soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice shop wants to bottle and sell cold coffee.
It is possible that the café will expand into the next building.
For many customers, it is enough to have their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular, and he said he was uncomfortable when the place was closed.
When the new place was opened, Whitt said that he felt as if he had come home walking in and ordering coffee.
"I wanted to smell it," he said.
A Square Meal: crippling food
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in his office.
President Roosevelt liked the sophisticated Fifth Avenue food, such as the goose liver pâté, and Maryland's swamp turtle soup.
That day his diet was more modest - stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato sauce, and for dessert from plum pudding.
"It was a sign of culinary solidarity with people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
His wife, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, told of Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told of life in the Lower East Side apartment building through food in his 97 Orchard.
Their latest cooperation, A Square Meal, published by Harper on Tuesday, is a historian of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
By showing some kind of culinary solidarity, they meet a journalist for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, subtle lunch bar in the Flatiron region, which has been active since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took the dose with turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetables.
When a journalist ordered a meat loaf, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss eating depression.
"The grits were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut loaf, liverloaf, papumure.
They were made from the ingredient and from some cheap ingredient that continued the actual ingredient.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to make your dinner.
Coe was a jerk.
"It must have felt like lead in the stomach," he said.
During the years before the recession on American tables, especially in the countryside, was like eating-as much-as you can-get-out table.
Women's groups made food for male farm workers, and fresh pie was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The Americans sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. The A Square Meal chronicles the ways in which the nation survived that suddenly it was no longer a land of abundance.
"Then food became a central, distressing subject for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new, inexpensive diet: Mysterious dishes, such as crumbs and boxes, became the main foods, and the box was "a great way to use leftovers," said Ziegelman, because chefs could hide less attractive ingredients under a creamy sauce layer.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
The meat that had been at the heart of American meals for years became a sparingly dispensed luxury product.
Special compositions were tried when calorie and nutrient content were more important than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
In carrying out the study also for a recipe - containing book, Ziegelman prepared an era course in which fried onions were filled with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the dinner table," Coe said.
Ziegelman said, "It was unreal."
Peanut butter is not in any way suitable for fried onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Home economic experts, such as Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Home Office from 1923 to 1943, directed the country's eating habits more than ever before or since.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgeters" and to meet the challenge of converting lumps like decorated spaghetti and carrots into tasty dishes.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical flavors.
Particularly tasty are the reports of the government's reaction to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's, let me eat your cake attitude.
While publicly praising his childhood's simple, Iowa country food, he ate like a sophisticated millionaire he had become.
"He liked continental food, like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate a tuxedo in an almost gold-plated dining room.
He was awesome out of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example on his own stomach.
As the book tells us, when Mrs Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place "which offered not only one of Washington's worst food, but also the worst prepared food."
Many of the slumped eating habits were abandoned as soon as the earth got back on its feet.
The legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition," Ziegelman said, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that when writing the book, they gained a better understanding of Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, such as how she could not throw away food.
"He was really afraid of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman remembered, "He even made people sick."
There was a windshield incident.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe drew out the dessert that they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called plum foam," Ziegelman said adding that the general trick was to give a name for modest recipes.
The dessert had no whipped cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone sank their spoons reluctantly into a sticky, brown lid.
Suddenly, it wasn't bad.
Coe screamed once and twice.
Sounding like a positive budgeter, he told his wife, "Slightly chopped walnuts could help."
Gilead will be reimbursed for legal expenses in the fight against hepatitis C patent against Merck
The U.S. Fiancée has ordered Gilead Sciences Inc to be entitled to the legal expenses it incurred in the case of hepatitis C patients against the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from payments of $200 million after their violation of two patents by Merck relating to Gilead's success medicines, Sovald and Harven. This exemption was followed by the discovery by a U.S. judge of Merchki's abuses, including perjury and other unethical practices.
In Thursday's judgment, U.S. Fiancée Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to exemption from the compensation it received in opposition to the action.
Merck is trying to catch Gilead, which controls the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines, which can significantly cure more than 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The legal case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other for the ownership of the laboratory work at the bottom of the sofosbuvir.
United States-supported troops say they've taken over Isis-controlled Manbij.
The troops supported by the United States have taken over the northern city of Manbij, near the Turkish border, since the last remaining Isis fighters left the city, the group representative said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last group of fighters hid in the city left.
The troops had released more than 2,000 Sicilian prisoners who were held captive by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish SDF's allies, Manbij's military council, told Reuters.
"We now have complete control of the city, but we have begun to investigate it," he told Reuters.
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2 percent federal taxes
On Friday Hillary Clinton published its 2015 tax return showing that the Democratic presidential candidate and his spouse's income in that year was $10.75 million and that their real federal tax rate was 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charitable organizations, mainly the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton made nearly $5.3 million in speech compensation, and the former Foreign Minister announced that he had received $3 million from Simon & Schuster for his book on his career in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's vice-president, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, published ten-year tax returns.
Their real federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set the standard for financial transparency," said Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in the statement.
In sharp contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdraws his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is customary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even if the law does not oblige them.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the tax administration for an audit as a reason for refusing to publish tax returns.
"Your turn," Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams said on Twitter when he published a link to the Democratic candidate's tax returns.
On Thursday, Mr Trump's special assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audits were completed.
Trump critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said that his refusal to raise questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his transactions and numerous other ties to Russia, for example.
Clinton has taken up the problem by publishing a web video on Friday, highlighting visible Republicans who are calling on Trump to publish his taxes.
On Thursday he raised the problem in his economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every candidate for president in recent decades has done: publish his tax return," he told the public.
Politico has announced that Trump has not paid any or very little taxes in the two 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist quoted numerous tax lawyers and accountants on Friday who said that the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a problem in the presidential election.
Clinton has supported a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that those earning more than $1 million a year would pay at least 30% tax.
President Barack Obama also supports this proposal.
At Clinton's meeting in Nebraska, Omaha, last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is located there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Mr Buffett said that he was also in the process of carrying out an audit of the tax administration, and that Mr Trump was not "a fear" of the tax collection agency, but of voters.
The Clinton campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
Today, the real federal tax rate of Clintons living in Chappaqua, New York, was around 32% between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined tax rate was about 40.5%.
Clinton's 2015 tax return showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment was inexpensive, index-linked investment fund, and Clinton reported $109,000 in dividends and interest income.

Chili powder condoms and firecrackers enhance the protection of Tanzania's elephant
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unusual method to prevent elephants from wandering into human settlements - throwing animals with chili powder-filled condoms.
The method has proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, together with the American Nature Conservancy, has come up with the idea several years ago, has intensified its advertising by training volunteers in North Tanzania villages to use a non-violent four-step approach to protecting homes and hundreds of animals without injury.
In the past, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is the world's elephant day dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since we developed tools...we have seen a change of attitude in these communities. They are now much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them," said Damian Bell, Executive Director of the Honeyguide.
The first two steps include pointing the intrusive elephant with a flashlight and ringing the horn.
If it doesn't stop the animal, we throw the so-called "chilip cloud."
The condom is filled with a mixture of chilli powder and ground and a firecracker, and then the condom is twisted so that only the fuse is visible.
When a condom is ignited, it bursts and bursts into the air with chili powder dust.
One scent is usually enough to send an elephant in the other direction.
The last resort is a trigger that shoots a Roman candle into the air, and the fireworks produce a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: Jewish filmmaker criticized the Berlin hotel, which removed Israel's area code at the request of Arabs
A French filmmaker with Jewish background unleashed a media storm after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's area code. According to the employee, this is due to the "requests" of Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, who made the Shoah documentary on the Holocaust, expressed his frustration at the Berlin Hotel Kempinski Bristol, writing an open letter in the German FAZ publication.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find the list of country codes offered by the Israeli hotel.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How can it be that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of new Germany, Israel has been removed and wiped?
Lanzmann wrote.
On the other hand, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through its own telephone center.
When looking for an explanation, the filmmaker brought it up at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer that came from there "shooked him."
The hotel's recipeist said it was a "premeditated decision by the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason behind the decision caused even more shock in the filmmaker.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they are demanding the removal of Israel's area code," says the worker Lanzmann.
Israeli Ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman calls the case "a great injustice," Zuddeutsche Zeitung reported.
"We were terrified and shocked by the incident.
That is a great injustice in itself.
But an even greater shame is that this happened in Germany and in this particular hotel chain.
This doesn't need an explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident caused quite a reaction online when people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel simply "did in" to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Shame," said another publication, pointing out that the hotel on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm street stands near the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly denied all charges and called what happened "intelligence" and "forgive" Lanzmann," Der Spiegel reported.
"A clear order not to include Israel on the shortlist was never made," says Kempinski's representative, according to Suddeutsche Zeitung.
It adds that the area code has now been added.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students who showed their minds
On Thursday, students met with the police in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, when students met to protest against reforms of the government's public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protestors.
Problems began when law enforcement tried to break up a group of students, leading to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended the demonstration to express their horror at plans.
According to proposals made by Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, governor of Sao Paolo, little less than 100 public schools would be closed and 300 000 pupils would be reinvested to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen writing graffiti against interim President Michel Temer on the walls.
This latest demonstration took place only days after the protestors set out as one force to support the arresting President Dilma Rousseff while the country's Senate voted on his charges.
RT business: sudden increase in trade between Russia and Iran of 71%
Since the abolition of sanctions, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9% compared to the previous year," says Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since the abolition of international sanctions against Iran, Russian companies have shown a great deal of interest in business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
"One of the main objectives of Iran's bilateral cooperation is to expand trade," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, the turnover of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9% compared to the same period of 2015, amounting to a total of USD 856 million.
Russia's exports to Iran in particular increased by 91.5% with a total of USD 697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16% to USD 158 million.
"The growth of the market was achieved by supplying machinery, vehicles and weapons," said the ambassador.
In addition, Dzhagaryan is expecting a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, Russian foreign representatives in Iran issued around 35 000 visas to Iranian citizens mainly for travel.
Iran was also among the 20 countries most visited by tourists in Russia for the first time.
"It must be safe to say that last year's record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi. They have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Scots Callum Skinner crashed to the finish line while the British grabbed the bike gold.
Scots Callum Skinner took credit in the men's team print at Rio's cycling stadium last night, when the British team trio defended the championship from London in 2012.
A 23-year-old from Glasgow was an anchor in the role of his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy, proud of the young man when he got into the finish line grabbing his favorite victory from the New Zealand team.
Britain took the shock victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold.
And they repeated the stunt after modestly setting up the sixth in March at the World Run Championship in London, even though Hoy has since finished his race career.
The problem between Beijing and London was replacing Jamie Staff, a special envoy.
This was accomplished just in time for Hindes to appear.
Hoy's ending also created a vacuum that Kian Emad and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
Skinner was the man that British coaches held to in view of the potential that has now been realised in Scotland.
Hindes, Kenny... who won the championship four years ago with Hoy... and Skinner made an Olympic record in time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
After his own round, Hindes was a little behind, but Kenny pushed the team in, and Skinner held onto it.
The strategy change was a big part of the transformation, and it included Hindes driving a bigger gear to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy followed his position as an expert at the BBC and drew Skinner, Kenny and Hindes' attention as they entered the podium.
Twenty-three-year-old Glasgow Skinner said, "comparison is flattering."
I'm only here to do the best I can to make a name for myself.
At the finals, we scored an Olympic record and won the world champions.
It was absolutely incredible.
There can't be a better way to win.
After winning in London in 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a bad start.
He later withdrew his comments and Britain's rivals have not complained.
This time, there was no such problem with overwhelming profits.
Hindes said, "I felt like I was in London when there were so many British flags on the pedestal."
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympic Games again is simply wonderful.
One event, one gold medal for a nation that won seven out of ten bikes in Beijing and London.
If this reflects the progress of the last five months, we will be waiting for a successful five days at the cycling stadium.
Based on Kenny's condition, it is not at all impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat of winning three Olympic gold in one Olympic Games.
This would mean that Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (that holy day in British sports, which is also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday) - would have a total of six medals in gold and one silver.
It'd be like Hoy's.
Kenny's gonna compete next in a sprint that starts today and lasts three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this one now.
The team race is always the best.
We'll win it together with the guys.
To be honest, winning alone is lonely."
Hindes said, "If he wins another two gold medals, he should be given a knight's rank."
This was the only medal contest today, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owain Doll were the fastest in time in a four-man, four-mile team-run.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The world record winning gold in London 2012 is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will take place today, the second day of the competition, when Wiggins will certainly be the focus of attention.
He had an argument with the judges yesterday before the time runs when officials invited him to a length measurement.
In a similar women's competition, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavien Katie Archibald progressed in world record time at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its great racing team will take over the central part of the Olympic Games and achieve a whole series of medals.
After a truly exceptional and complete management in Beijing and London, expectations have been underestimated before the Rio Games.
The background has been drama, not least the resignation of the Technical Director, Shane Sutton, in April due to sexism and temptation charges, and the end of the career of majors such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on the first night's competitions at the cycling stadium, it seems that the legendary reputation of Britain now peaks at a perfect moment could once again be true.
Portland's thawless future questionable due to the cutting of the electricity contract
The future of the Victoria aluminium meltdown in Portland, as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers, is uncertain when the electricity company that distributes electricity to the plant revealed that one of the owners of the plant is concluding the distribution contract, so a cut in all distribution contracts is expected.
The measure follows the decision taken earlier this year by the Victoria administration that the aid required to maintain the plant will not be continued.
For a period of 20 years, aid will cease in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at the Alcoa Portland factory.
Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk, directly or indirectly, with the closure of the plant.
In addition, a snowball effect may be possible, as the thawing process consumes about 10% of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's meltdown, which led to the closure of the Anglesea plant last year.
The downfall of Alcoa Portland is losing money and is under threat of closure.
The measure now follows speculation for several years about the future of the plant, which began with a strong Australian dollar and has recently been due to the cost of production.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminium smelter from its Loy Yang An power plant in Latrobe Valley, said that it also expects three other owners to terminate their contract.
Most of the factory is owned by the Alcoa-Alumina Group, while Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
"AGL awaits the continued operation of the Portland plant, which means that the non-melting physical electricity demand will continue," it said.
According to the AGL, the agreements are so-called "protection agreements' which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will actually end in 2017.
"That is why AGL expects the contracts to produce results for the financial year 2017," said the electricity company.
All possible results for AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by the strong prospects for futures markets in wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said that it has already "in anticipation of termination" reduced the value of contracts in its accounts by USD 187 million.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect the ability of Alcoa ... to keep the melting in operation or to safeguard the non-melting supply of electricity."
The US company said that it signed a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010 and that the agreement was due to enter into force in November this year, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew from the agreement.
Analysts have been alert not only to the meltdown in Portland, Victoria, but also to the possible closure of the Tomogo plant near Newcastle, because of the poor economic situation in the sector.
Earlier in the week, AGL Executive Director Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland uses approximately 600 megawatts of electricity each year and Tomago about 900 megawatts each year.
"If both plants leave the market, this is a significant reduction in demand for the [electricity] market.
For us, as a producer of electricity, this would not be a good thing," he said.
Kendall, not just the Kardashian reality star, is on the cover of September Vogue.
Kendall Jenner, fourth daughter of the Kris Kardashian-Jenner clan, 20 model and mother-manager, is on the cover of the United States Vogue's desired September issue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's brand ambassador and modeled the fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday in his Instagram account.
"Looking at this cover in a room full of loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover release was followed by an eccentric (or perhaps just Kardashian-style?), a scripted reality video, where the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (excluding problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, with everyone's favorite entertainment uncle, Keeping Up's producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot his sister's cover but ended with a classic turn: they planned surprise parties.
This is the cliché of almost every "birthday" feature of the children's television series (Seacrest says the lines "you didn't think we'd forget you" with the credibility of the morning bunny junkie), but Kris had to somehow get his other girls to benefit from this publicity.
This is because we have certainly moved on to the new Kardashian era with the September Vogue place.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have gotten to Vogue's lawsuit first (she shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is in its very own category.
The September issue of Vogue is the most selling edition of the whole year.
Its thickness is more like a coffee record than a fashion magazine, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion calculated that 615 of the 832-page opus last year had advertising content).
The revelation of its cover star is so eagerly awaited that for the past two years the pictures of the magazine have leaked before the official release.
Previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
Indeed, in recent years there have been more "celebrities who act as models" on the cover than "models that are celebrities."
The Oscar winner and Dior's ambassador, Jennifer Lawrence, was on the cover in 2013, the year after Lady Gaga's place of honor.
But if it were to happen that Jenner, whom the magazine describes as "the model of success" of his generation, would hit the first category, he is in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people or reality stars or youths of today who can make a good Snapchat video (even though Jenner is all of this).
They are rightly talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
Last year's cover model Beyonce has had one of the strongest years of his career since Lemonade was released.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
In his reality TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "bitch of the moment."
This feeling surfaced again with Jenner's Vogue deck.
But spinning in discontent is out of place.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
He's a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's makeup cream.
He and all his sisters sell you pictures of themselves in their own apps behind the payment wall.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter that she took for Love magazine.
And in his spare time, possibly just to see his sister Kourtney and her kids, he's a reality star.
Community legal centres turn 160 000 people away each year
More than 160 000 of the most vulnerable people are turned away from the Community's legal centres each year as the sector prepares for the effects of further cuts in funding on its already extreme activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who do not have the means to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already being turned away in their search for free legal advice and representation.
Legal services already stretched to the limits of the Community are preparing for further cuts.
In June of next year, these legal centres will lose 30% of their federal funding.
According to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres, James Farrell, head of the Community Legal Centres in Queensland, said that thousands of people are already being turned away every year.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not withdrawn, it will only get worse.
"Queensland Community Legal Centres are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are turned away every year from the essential services they need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships with uncontrolled and crippled debts, separated families, unfairly separated workers - all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they do not get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30% in June 2017, which means that thousands of vulnerable people in Queensland will be forced to navigate in the face of complex legal problems without help.
We appeal to the Minister of Justice and to Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately cancel these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the state government undertook to raise the funding of legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the Community Legal Centre and their customer communities, and the Government of Palaszczuk must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was sued after an employee was alleged to be at risk with a gun.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly not doing anything after being told that the head of North Carolina's operations threatened a worker with a gun in February while driving in Jeep.
The incident was described in an action brought by the former software trainee Vincent Bordin of the state campaign at Charlotte State Court on Wednesday.
Mr Bordini said that he waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally before he realized that "it wouldn't happen."
Chief Earl Phillip "picked up a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger and pushed the pipe against Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign administration, Bordini heard that at least four other people had had the same experience with Phillip, said the lawsuit.
"You don't have to fire guns to cause damage," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The challenge comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused anger when he told the public in North Carolina that "people of the Second Amendment" - generally understood arms owners and arms enthusiasts - could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and allowed to choose judges.
Trump's campaign said that the media took his words out of context and that he did not support violence.
In Bordin's challenge, the campaign seeks compensation for careless supervision and Phillip for violence, assault and emotional shock.
Mr Hope Hicks, representing Trump, did not respond to the request for a comment immediately.
Attempts to reach Phillip failed.
WCCB, a local news subsidiary in Charlote reports that Phillip has recently left the campaign.
His consultant's request for a call to Innovative Consulting Services was not answered immediately.
The campaign of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been controversial.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and prosperity throughout the stomach, not just in local communities and across London.
For me, this was Heathrow's great charm, just as it was the charm of the 2012 London Games when we went to great lengths to ensure that all our peoples and regions would benefit from the games.
The Olympic Games brought enormous benefits to Stratford and East End.
And we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
10,000 new traineeships and 40 000 new jobs will be created for local communities alone and youth unemployment around the airport will be abolished.
As before the 2012 London Games, some come to think that the challenge of extending Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the games and that we would be ashamed of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question that is put to it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and the growth of GBP 211 billion, leaving the legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and around Great Britain.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented a GBP 11 billion infrastructure investment programme on time and budget: from T5, which has been voted the world's best airport terminal for five years in a row, to T2, which was built between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now the team is ready to implement a third runway supported by £16 billion of private money.
The 2012 London Olympic Games were a great success for Great Britain, and I am convinced that the extension of Heathrow is also a success.
It is time we channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow, ensure the future of our trade and create a heritage of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the chairman of Heathrow Board and former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook in Cat and Mouse Play for Preventing Advertisement
For companies that receive money from online advertising, attempts to bypass advertising are "cat and mouse" games," said one of the companies producing such a program.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would prevent advertisers from using their computer sites, Adblock Plus published a blog article that said that users could update the software filters to prevent advertising again on the social network pages.
On Tuesday Facebook said that its website code is changed around ads to make it more difficult for advertisers to see which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says it's gone around a new code.
In the blog article, Adblock's representative Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of back and forth battle between the open-source advertising community and its travelers has been going on since advertising was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will come up with its own solution soon.
The fact that the largest social media company in the world has taken part in the fight is a strong indication of the great sadness that advertising inhibitors have become for industry.
Worldwide, around 200 million people use advertisers, reports the study of Pagefair and Adobe last year. This is almost four times the number that used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and now 84% of Facebook's advertising revenue is covered by the mobile advertising.
However, the company is after computer ad adverts because mobile ads do not work on Facebook's mobile applications for a social network or Instagram," the representative said.
Computer ads still generate enough revenue to make Facebook consider this type of action worth investing in.
On Tuesday, too, Facebook said that it used its daily "advertisement" tool to give people more control over how advertisements are targeted at them.
On Thursday Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrying because they would also block some of the website's non-advertising content.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem," said Facebook's representative in the e-mail statement.
Advertisers are boring tools, which is why we have instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
She was hit by a car on a Swiss highway, apparently due to suicide.
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for eyewitnesses after a woman was hit by several vehicles on the highway during the early hours of Thursday, which apparently was suicide.
The incident took place on the A1 road near Morges in Vaudi canton just after midnight on Thursday.
She did a "desperate act" and lay down in the dark on a road in which she was hit by several vehicles," Vaud's police said in a statement.
The victim, who clearly tried to kill himself, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the event have already been questioned, but some have not yet been identified, said the police who appeal to them and all witnesses who witnessed the incident to report.
A criminal investigation has begun, which is a "logical" step in a situation like this," the lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneva.
"However, it remains to be seen whether any of the involved drivers will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
It's gonna be up to the DA," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases of the last five years suggest that drivers are not held liable.
In both cases - both of which had a person walking on the dark highway - it was estimated that drivers could not expect to meet a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the paper said.
Last year, the police were released from the charges of negligence after hitting and killing a man lying on the A! road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court was told.
The Court found that the police who were responding to the emergency call drove in a justified manner and that the presence of the man on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information on Thursday's case near Morges should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus was probably once habitable.
Scientists at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to study Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surfaces and carbon dioxide - filled air sprays, could sometimes have had landlike conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotational speed is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earthlike atmosphere, and still could have been spinning slowly.
The model also examined the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had areas that were dryer than Earth, but there was once enough water and geographical variation to make life possible and to protect against rapid water evaporation.
The early Venus also had the advantage of a 30 - percent dim sun.
"In the simulation of the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus reveals it to the sun for almost two months at a time," explained GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio in a news bulletin.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of cloud that acts as an umbrella protecting the surface from much of the sun's heat.
As a result, the average temperature of the climate is actually a few degrees cooler than the current Earth.
The model produced a story from Venus's developmental stages similar to what planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was likely to be habitable at times, it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapours burned under ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, all that remained was the thick carbon dioxide atmosphere with its deadly greenhouse gas phenomena - Venus, which we now know.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy's giving up the Avalanche coach's job.
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned from the activities of the Coach of Colorado Avalanche and the Vice-President of hockey affairs, which is the reason for the lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado's Vice President/Director General Joe Sakic confirmed the information and mentioned that the team will start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have done my duty as vice-president and head coach of the hockey affairs of Colorado Avalanche with enthusiasm, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
During the summer I have thought long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and to take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the view of the coach and the vice-president of hockey matters must be fully in line with that of the organisation.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are not being met at the moment.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me today about his decision," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and we wish him luck in the future.
Roy was named the winner of the Jack Adams Award awarded to the best coach in the league in his first Avalanche season 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and the victory of the middle division, but Minnesota knocked out Colorado's playoffs in the first round, and the team hasn't been able to follow up in the last two years.
Avalanche games in 2015-16 ended with 39 wins, 39 loses and 4 draws, and the team lost by five points to Wild, losing the Wild Card slot of the Western Conference.
The chosen goaltender Roy of the Hall of Fame won four Stanley Cups - two in both Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue negotiations and postpone strike
The labour disputes of North Sea oil workers for wages are postponed when all the parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, the leading negotiators said.
Strikes against the oilfield service company Wood Group have been arranged randomly on the North Sea rigs led by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the United States and the RMTs can confirm that we have agreed to reopen the process of resolving the current dispute," said the joint statement.
Over the next few weeks, we will have several full-day meetings starting early next week so that we can take a fresh view of the problems.
According to trade unions, their recent employment action, which they say will be the first in over 25 years, was an objection to possible, up to 30% wage cuts.
This year Wood Group cut the fees for North Sea contractors by about 9% due to negative market pressure.
The company's fee reduction follows a 10% reduction in the number of contractors in its country from 2014.
The company said that further cuts would give the company the necessary room for manoeuvre to cope with the downturn in the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has reduced thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as a result of its giant merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices and this economic situation is exacerbated by Britain's June decision to leave the European Union.
Dave Anderson, a Scottish Member of Parliament, met with allies earlier this week to discuss one of the greatest labour disputes of the generation in the North Sea.
He said that the North Sea was essential to the region's economy.
"We need an economy that works for many, not just a few, both in the North Sea and in the whole country," he said in the statement.
In 2016, the North Sea is expected to invest less than USD 1.4 billion in new projects, while the average for the previous five years has been around USD 7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of the stars in the Pleiades Star Corps.
The latest task of Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete listing of the stars of the Pleiades Stars.
New data will help astronomers to understand why the stars of the group rotate at varying speeds, as well as how the cycles are related to planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star groups, we will now learn more about the relationship between the star mass, its age and even its solar system', Caltech's infrared processing and analysis researcher Luisa Rebull at the Pasadena Center said in a press release
The Pleiades are located 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the stars of the group have been born about 125 million years ago and are now reaching adulthood.
They're now spinning at the highest level.
At its peak speed, these grown - up stars plunge large amounts of star wind.
As these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they brake the stars.
As the star grows older, its speed of rotation begins to slow.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by following the appearance of recognizable starspots, such as sunspots.
The most recent list of star speeds suggests that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, which the bigger ones make the pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
"In the Pleiades' ballet, we see that slow spinrs are usually more massive, whereas the fastest spinrs are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Since the Pleiades are so close, it is an ideal cosmic laboratory for assessing star characteristics at rotation speeds.
"The Pleiades Starfleet offers anchor stars to rotate into theoretical models, comprising both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have much to learn about how, because and why the stars slow down their rotation speed and so to speak, hang their 'dancing shoes' on the nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of Plejades' speed of rotation in three articles which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
