9-year-old boy on the run in Tampere found
The police have had a search mission because of a 9-year-old boy's flight to Tampere on Tuesday evening.
A missing persons report about a boy who left West Tampere with a friend has spread on social media.
According to the police situation centre, the boy has been contacted and has no danger to life or health.
The boy's father told Ilta-Sanom at midnight that the boy was found.
He's fine, and now we're going to start the after hearings.
The boy was found near the home, the father said.
Ronaldo, on the other hand, ransacked the score to Messi.
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league this weekend and continued to produce in the Champions League as well.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo over the Champions League's goal king turned at least for a moment to the advantage of the latter.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo went to the top of all-time scorer statistics alone when he shot the visitor Shahtar Donetsk's net with two shootouts and one in the game situation.
Ronaldo raised his goal balance to 80 when the Barcelona Messi, who had been evenly read with him before Tuesday, had 77 hits.
Real won 4-0.
Juventus has stumbled in Italy's football league in Serie A from the early days, but in the Champions League's League's League's D-block it started with a powerful 2-1 guest victory from Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored over ten minutes before the end of Juventus' Alvaro Morata.
The city's attack was blunted by the absence of knee-weak Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in the weekend's champion league game, didn't come to the airport until the last ten minutes.
Manchester's second club United also suffered hard in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after having suffered a 1-2 loss.
ManU's 20-year-old wingman Luke Shaw had only a quarter of an hour in a foreign game.
PSV Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking slide tackle hit ManU-baked goal so badly that Shaw was likely to break his tibia.
Shaw lay on the grass at Eindhoven's home stadium for about ten minutes before medical staff left to transport him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests to a 1-0 lead at 41 minutes, but ManU's joy lasted just a few minutes.
Moreno evened out before the break with extra time.
The PSV winning goal was scored at the second half by Luciano Narsingh.
In the Champions League of the Painting Period, Paris Saint-Germain of the A-block began.
An Argentine Angel Di Maria changed Manchester United's shirt to PSG.
Di Maria broke through the right and lifted the ball to the mantelpiece past Malmo's goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani did 2-0 for PSG in the second half.
PSG has been guessed among the season's winners.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of the league's small clubs, is not the best possible benchmark.
For the first time, PSG star attacker Zlatan Ibrahimovic faced his professional career as a starting club with Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team in Moscow's TsSKA lost 0-1 to Wolfsburg in a B-block match in Germany.
The opposition party demanded immediate resignation - the president gave the wrong speech
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has given the same speech in the country's parliament at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently didn't realize the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether 91-year-old Mugabe is fully alive.
The main opposition party MDC demanded Mugabe resign because he is too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants rushed to say that the confusion had taken place only in Mugabe's headquarters and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech discussed earlier and now China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an extraordinary summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have proposed an extra summit of EU leaders next week because of the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, who is leading the summits, will assess the request.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, state leaders should discuss cooperation with countries of origin and how to better register those who come to Europe.
According to Merkel, the negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers belong to the home ministers' table.
The teacher admits to shooting his girlfriend during a 911 call
The voice only slightly shivering university teacher Shannon Lamb tells the police during the emergency call that she shot her girlfriend and that the police have to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "golden dog" is alive and probably shocked, and said that the contact details of the dead woman's next of kin can be found on her phone.
Inside the house the police found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten note on the page of the notebook: "I'm so sorry I wish I could take it back I loved Amy and she's the only woman that ever loved me," said a letter that experts said was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Cleveland Delta State University in Minnesota, had already travelled nearly 500 kilometres to a school campus where the police believe he shot and killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, to the door of this study.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said the university staff heard a shooting at 10:18 pm.
He said Lamb made a fatal 911 call some time after that.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths rose by one more: Lamb committed suicide while the police surrounded the sound.
Authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb's motive the day after students and staff had to hide behind locked doors because of school shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have released information that says students and staff described Lamb as a talented teacher, but who may have had problems.
The students said they were waiting for her classes.
Gautier, a police officer in Prentiss's place of death, said Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in his book, in which he thanked the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 staff members in total, and many of the students participated in both men's courses.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb, but said he also seemed nervous and restless, "as though something was wrong."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb said he had a lot of stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously requested sick leave from Delta State University, saying he had some kind of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
The recent changes in the university's pay principles meant that, although Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it did not guarantee him an automatic career development and an assistant professorship.
University principal William LaForge said there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt as far as he knew, but that " clearly there was something in Lamb's mind."
Lamb is no longer able to answer these questions.
After Lamb escaped campus, the police were able to track him when he moved back to Mississippi from the state of Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol in a house's backyard about a mile south of his parents' house in Greenville, Mississippi, suburbs, said Washington County coroner Methel Johnson.
Lamb's car was still running in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this very house, even though Johnson said he believed Lamb knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the university in 2009 and taught geography and education, with 3,500 students and is located in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb completed a doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who tried to teach Hairston how to play guitar for many years.
He was quite a charmer back then.
All the girls were melted wax when she was there, now told by the 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in Jackson's suburbs in Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house on the riverfront in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen said they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
"She's really upset," O'Steen described her daughter.
He was his mother's best friend.
O'Steen said he hadn't met Lamb, but he had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both performing on the summer market three years ago.
Later, they played together at a few gigs.
O'Steen said his daughter does and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainment organizer at the perplexed bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmonica performance for a few audiences.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were messing with each other. We were throwing things at each other.
So they were both quite clever.
Dead teacher Schmidt led the first year's students' seminar programme, specialized in Indians and colonial history, said the school's English teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and had three small children.
He studied at the Kansas Emporia State University and was the president of his fraternity and student board.
On Tuesday evening, Delta State campus in Cleveland, there was a candle-drinking, attended by about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students and members of the community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the Mass, during which the university choir sang the songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The lesson will continue on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
Now is the time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland in Mississippi.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster from Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana from New Orleans took part in the report.
The case has been corrected according to police now saying Lamb made an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and even though Lamb referred to Prentis as his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees during the holiday season
Toys R Us says it doesn't hire as many employees for the holiday season as it did last year, but the dealer of toy and baby products says that current regular and seasonal workers are given the opportunity to do more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and distribution centres across the country, while there were 45,000 people hired during the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said the interviews will begin this month, and the number of staff will rise from October to December.
Despite months of holiday time, the Christmas shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help with the occupation of shops, as well as the sale, dispatch and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of the "Back to the Future" film was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also noteworthy for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theatre waiting for the royals to arrive, and I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana's seat was next to me," she said in the future documentary film Back in Time's trailer.
The film begins and it reminds me that I'm just a fake yawn and a hand stretch away from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and production director Steven Spielberg.
The return to the future was premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg said: "I'm sure it's the greatest time travel film of all time."
Back in Time is available as a video on demand, DVD and in some cinemas in October.
UN leader says the situation in Syria will not be resolved with arms
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's response to Russia's increasing military support for Syria is that this almost five-year conflict "will not be resolved with arms" and the additional weapons will only exacerbate the violence and the suffering of millions.
The UN leader again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support any non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
At a Wednesday's press conference, Ban said he was going to meet the foreign ministers of five permanent Member States - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - in connection with the ministerial week of the General Assembly later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and regional forces "has made the situation impossible to resolve."
Ban called on five permanent Member States to show the solidarity and consensus they showed when dealing with the Syrian crisis when agreeing on Iran's nuclear programme.
8 polls that show Donald Trump is serious
Some have tried to label him as a wind quail.
Others think he's just a joke.
Some are waiting for the crash.
Even though some Republicans have tried to get Donald Trump off the top of the polls, it has not (yet) succeeded.
Of the last 11 national polls, 10 Donald Trump has been in charge in a two-digit number, and some have begun to seriously wonder what this means for the real estate king's appointment prospects.
Of course, the parliamentary term is still in its early stages.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to be a Republican candidate.
Commentators point out that, at this stage in 2011, Rick Perry was losing his lead in the up-and-coming Herman Cain, neither of which got no state behind in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in general elections.
However, outside groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Union Club for Growth have noted Trump's tenacity and begun to use its resources to overthrow him.
The following recent support polls suggest that the real estate king is not just a passing phase:
Trump's popularity figures have turned around.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, the Monmouth University polls showed that only two out of ten Republicans welcomed the real estate king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
Currently, six out of ten Republicans welcome Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative attitude.
These figures are also true in the first primary states.
In a poll conducted by the University of Quinnipiac in Iowa last week, 60 percent of Republicans said they were positive about Trump.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be happy if Trump became a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would either be "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump were a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they would be "strung up" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson produces about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent "inspired" vs. Trump's 40 percent).
The next most enthusiastic?
Marco Rubio only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of Republican voters would be "unsatisfied" or "disturbed" if Jeb Bush, who is their favorite, became a candidate.
Trump's fiery nature is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trump has been widely criticised for his pompous speeches and insults, according to Monday's ABC News/Washington Post poll, 52 percent of the voters who lean on Republican side at national level think that the real estate king has the right character for the president.
According to a poll from Quinnipiac last week, in the state of Iowa holding the first party meeting, the figure is the same: 52 percent of Republicans think Trump has the right character for the leader.
However, according to the ABC/Post survey, 44 percent feel that his character is not suitable for being president, and nearly six out of ten feel that his character is not part of the White House.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is a real option.
According to a CNN/ORC survey, four out of ten considered Trump the most likely option when asked who is most likely to be nominated as a Republican candidate.
Still at the end of July, four out of ten were in favour of Jeb Bush.
Information release: Republican voters have not always had the brightest crystal ball available.
During the last parliamentary term, four out of ten Republicans felt Rick Perry was nominated and only 28 percent supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that most Republican voters find Trump's campaign credible.
Even if Republicans were to stand up for another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmented field is likely to have contributed to Trump's leadership, as the support against Trump has been divided among a number of other candidates.
However, a survey conducted by Monmouth University in early September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump gets majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie with 33 points each.
He's tied up with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to win Trump?
If they were set up against each other, Ben Carson would win a businessman Trump with a huge 18 points difference.
Just barely a majority of Donald Trump's supporters have said they have made a decision.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters supporting Trump have decided who to vote for.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can say for sure that they will never change their mind.
46 percent said they might be able to change candidates.
In any case, Trump's biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they had made a decision are twice as likely to be on Trump's side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his campaign start-up speech two months ago, immigration has been at the heart of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump's pompousness drives Latino voters away from the Republican party and damages rebranding attempts.
According to a new ABC/Post survey released on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the centre of things, so is Donald Trump.
Frustration in the government has reached a new peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson's support now covers about half of Republican voters, largely because of their position outside politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said in Monday's ABC/Post poll that they would rather choose a non-political person than someone with government experience.
They are also angry with the federal government.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg two weeks ago in Iowa showed that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54 percent are "unsatisfied" and 21 percent are "really angry."
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's debut at Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election
The new Labour Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will meet David Cameron for the first time in Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn will rise to ask his first six questions shortly after noon, and likely both the media and Labour MPs will watch his performance closely.
Corbyn has demanded "less theatre and more facts" for this weekly show.
He has also said he could leave some of the opportunities to his colleagues.
This encounter is the first parliamentary test of Corbyn's leadership since he was appointed to the shadow government and spoke at the trade union federation's annual meeting on Tuesday.
At the same time, the Labour leader's decision to stand quietly during the national anthem during Tuesday's memorial service, which took place on the 75th anniversary of the Battle from Britain air war, has raised criticism among Conservative MPs and appeared in several front page stories.
Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
Corbyn's spokesman said he "stood with respect quietly" and that he acknowledged "the courage of the Royal Air Force in the British Air War."
Owen Smith, a member of Corbyn's shadow board, said to BBC Two Newsnight that he would have urged the Labour leader to sing the national anthem despite the fact that he felt the Royal House should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to be part of Corbyn's inner circle, appealing to differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs, originally supported by less than a sixth of the parliamentary party as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that the differences in policy regarding the party's position in the European Union and the government's cap have "crowded" also within the Labour Party since the appointment of Corbyn.
Mr Corbyn said at the trade union association meeting that the Labour Party is proposing a change that would remove the whole roof.
Hours later, shadow secretary Smith said that the party was "very clear" about simply opposing the government's plans to lower the ceiling from £26,000 to £230,000.
Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader that David Cameron has faced in the last decade, when he has been the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader has promised a new approach to politics and now says that he has "armed" ideas for questions to the Prime Minister and received over 30,000 proposals.
Islington North MP Corbyn has said that the Prime Minister's nature of Question Time is too confrontational and that he is going to refrain from both witty rhetoric and squirming, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Corbyn has said that the shadow government's financial secretary Angela Eagle will be his substitute for Question Time when Corbyn does not attend - for example when Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corbyn has also proposed that other colleagues should also be allowed to speak, and he has said that he has approached the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercowi, about the matter.
When Cameron took the lead in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from a political theatre that is often linked to Prime Minister's Question Time, but later he had to admit he had failed.
Since they began to be televised in 1990, Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important measure in assessing the director's judgment, his control over the House of Commons, and his position among other MPs, even though critics have criticised the polls for becoming nothing but a travesty that calls for far-reaching reforms.
photographed in Joburg: Homeless young people are trained as photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and make a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio where homeless young people are taught how to take photos of their neighborhood and profit from it.
BBC News met one of the first young people to graduate from the project.

The value of the pound will rise as British wage growth accelerates
The value of the pound jumped up after the numbers showed an increase in the UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 index rose with the offerer SABMiller.
Between May and July, UK wages, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The rate of growth was fastest after 2009 and was considered to bring with it estimates of rising rates.
The pound rose more than one per cent to $1.5505, and 0.84% to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most distinctive share on the market and rose by 20 per cent after the competitor AB InBev approached it with an offer.
The deal would unite the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands like Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 per cent after encouraging news from the rival luxury product group Richmont.
Richemont's latest sales figures were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in China - which is Burberry's key market - had begun to grow again.
Glencore's shares rose by 5 percent after the mine giant said it had raised $2.5 billion in shares as part of its debt-cutting strategy.
The packaging and paper group Mondi's shares were among the biggest calculators in the index by 4.3 per cent after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation to "sale."
JD Sports rose 3.1 percent after the sportswear company announced its six-month profit before taxes: 83 percent increase to £46,6 million.
According to JD Sports director, higher wages can damage expansion
Peter Cowgill, director of JD Sports, said that if the minimum wage of employees is raised in the UK, it could mean that "the purchasing power of potential consumers will increase."
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs for the company, Cowgill says.
The costs could be targeted at the company's expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash launches a grass-roots campaign against Aldi's invasion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi's attack in southern and western Australia.
Metcash, a food wholesaler, has launched a grass-roots campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South and West Australia before Aldin's $700 million attack.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first store early next year to South and West Australia, where there will be up to 120 shops, while Metcash and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food dealers and build an IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing, as well as through events such as the Adelaide Show.
IGA retailers and buyers have jumped in, and brands like Dunsborough ice cream manufacturer Simmo's offer samples at IGA stores, and store owners sell discount tickets to Australian football matches to their regular customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details about its defence strategy on 29 September, when this food, alcohol and hardware wholesaler organises an annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot in the game, as Southern and Western Australia together account for nearly 30 percent of Metcash's IGA stores and have higher profit margins than the IGA network in the eastern states of Metcash.
South and West Australia's shoppers are known to be cornered, and IGA retailers have a much bigger market share than New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30 percent in the south and 24 percent in the west compared to 14 percent in eastern states.
Analysts like Morgan Stanley believe, however, that Aldi will catch about 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of the first stores, with turnover coming from all operators, but mainly from independent retailers.
In his report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million a year for sale and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year Aldi will open 25 stores in the south and 30 stores in the west, generating $500 and $600 million in turnover in these areas.
The loss of food and food sales and quantities at Metcash's base for high fixed costs could cost Metcash about $13 million in operating profit losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, even though a recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA's customers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes Metcash's food and food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing its market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent in 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, the manager of the leading investment fund and founder of Magellan Financial Group, said at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "very possibly lose in a decade."
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglass' comments.
However, it has been understood that a member of Metcash's board had contacted Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen since 2010 from 18 per cent to 14 per cent, and the profits from Metcash's food and food business, which supplies about 1200 IGA retailers, have decreased by 43 per cent since 2012, which shows a reduction in debt financing for operations when sales and margins are under pressure.
However, the wholesaler stands up to himself, and has invested more than $150 million a year in reducing the prices of hundreds of products weekly to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA retailers to renovate stores by adding fast-growing fresh food, and bringing a better range of private brands to the market.
Metcash's chief executive, Ian Morrice, says that the fall in prices and the improvement of shops have increased attraction, and he hopes that the wholesaler will return to the path of profit growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Steve Healy, president of the Australian tennis association, supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves honor rather than criticism of his behaviour
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered collateral damage in a recent storm that has raged around his friend Nick Kyrgios, who deserves honor rather than criticism of his own behaviour, says Steve Healy, president of the Australian League of Tennis.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of a talented duo called "Special Ks", was unwittingly exposed to the incident where Kyrgios provoked Stan Wawrinka in the Montreal Masters competition.
Soon after this, in a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati, the chief judge had to dismiss Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, when Harrison declared: "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten that brat."
Even though Kokkinakis was last seen smashing his bat after cramping his potential victory over Richard Gasquet in US Open, Healy has been Kokkinakis' unfailing defender.
Right now the young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth for another place in doubles with Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
"I think quite strongly that Thanasi has just been dragged into a brawl," Healy said.
He broke his bat when he lost the cramp in US Open, but he's not the first player to break his bat in frustration, and I know Thanas well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But he has behaved excellently, also in quite provocative situations in US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he has been treated a bit harshly.
He's very mature to be 19, he works hard, he's fit for the team, and so on, and he's never had any problems with other players, he's appreciated in the locker room, he's training hard, he's in good shape, he's a very calm and mature young man, and I think he should be judged according to his merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to include Kyrgio in the important games that begin on Friday, describing this "common decision" as a good solution for everyone, but still supporting the return of the Canberran to the team's regular equipment.
"We want the team to be completely focused on the games and not all the polemics around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen really fast, as Federer and Murray, for example, have pointed out, and he is growing up in the public eye, and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has received, but we are trying to support him, try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think it's best for both the team and him if he spends some time out of the public thinking about these consequences.
European immigration crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border against Serbia, arresting those who tried to enter illegally, with the aim of daming the flow of migrants coming to the country.
There was chaos on the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in neutral territory, and Serbian authorities reacted with dismay.
The people who fled the violence in their own countries have now set up their tents and set themselves on an undefined road between the checkpoints of two countries.
But frustration grew.
While the police helicopter remained above them, the immigrants said "Open the border!" and shouted insults to Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water as a protest.
Serbia's Foreign Minister declared that it is "impossible to accept" the return of migrants from Hungary as more and more of Macedonia and Greece continue to arrive.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not to harm civilians.
The discussion will have to take place in the next few days with other countries and Brussels," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
A mess on the Hungarian-Serbia border arose after the 28-national group failed to create a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the division of 40,000 asylum seekers who have now taken over Italy and Greece, and they were hopeful that a final agreement would be reached - next month or by the end of next year - about which EU countries would take 120,000 additional refugees, including part of Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for an extra EU summit on Tuesday next week to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will act soon.
Tuesday's emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to act in a crisis and allowed you to be closed and asylum court cases to be speeded up.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence on the Serbian border is ready, the country will also set up a barbed wire fence on part of its border with Romania to stop the influx of immigrants across the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to finish the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the biggest bottleneck and a point of entry into the European Union for refugees, many of whom are fleeing war from Syria and the rest of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has claimed that most of those arriving are economic refugees looking for a better life, not those fleeing from the war who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly in conflict with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary now define an attempt to cross or damage a four-metre (13 feet) barbed wire fence built by the government on the southern border with Serbia as a crime, as well as longer prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Because of the situation caused by mass immigration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency," the government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told journalists in the southern Szeged city.
We are very clear on this: Illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Parliament still has to formally approve the military deployment expected for next week, but Associated Press reporters at the border have been seeing heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days.
Orban's national security advisor Gyorgy Bakondi said the authorities had apprehended 45 people trying to cross the border, as well as those who had already reached 15 countries.
They got over by damaging the fence, are now incarcerated by the police, and are accused of violations as defined in the new laws.
The authorities will quickly fix the fence.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossing points on the border with Serbia on Tuesday morning after sending a train wagon covered with barbed wire to close one of these places.
The main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, was covered in chaos when Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for handling people and crowds tried to shove in.
About 20 got in, but thousands were left outside.
A group of immigrants blocked the main motorway between Serbia and Hungary, saying they refuse to eat and drink until they are allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 elections: According to a national poll, Hillary Clinton's leadership in Bernie Sanders has narrowed by half
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues in double-digit lead in the Democratic nomination contest, but Senator Bernie Sanders is closing in on him.
Clinton is now supported by 47 per cent of Democratic voters (down from 58 per cent), while second-hand Sanders is supported by 27 per cent (down from 17 per cent).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he is going to the presidential race, but he is supported by 15 percent of Democratic voters.
More than five months before the primary election starts, most Democratic voters say it is still too early to say that they would have decided who to vote for.
Clinton's supporters stand behind their own choice, however, more firmly than those of other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has fallen among several population groups since last month's CBS News Poll survey, and at the same time Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is strongly in charge of women and moderates, but his leadership has narrowed.
His popularity among men has decreased considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's head start among Democratic voters under 50 has disappeared, and he is now even with Sanders.
Clinton, however, is clearly leading with older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders in a double-digit number among liberals, but now Sanders is leading this group by five percentage points.
About half of the country's Democratic voters say they will be very supportive of Clinton if he becomes a party candidate.
A quarter says they support him with certain reservations, and 15 percent would support him just because he is a candidate.
Six percent would not support him at all.
It is not very surprising that Clinton's current supporters are very likely to be enthusiastic about supporting him.
Opinions are more confusing for those who do not currently support Clinton - only a quarter of them would enthusiastically support him.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the Republicans' number one Donald Trump says the same thing with fewer Republican voters (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters were asked why they wanted him to be a candidate in an open question, the most popular answer was that he had the right experience (16 percent) and then the most popular answers were that it was the right time for the woman president (13 percent) and that he was the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Since the vice president has an influence on the possible presidential nomination, 57 percent of Democratic voters would like to see him already in the race - even though a third disagrees.
When asked by Democratic voters who they would choose second for the party's nomination, Biden is the most popular choice.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half say they would choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for Democratic nominations, Hilary Clinton's leadership from Sanders will increase, and if Biden leaves, the lead will be 20 percentage points, but if he leaves, it will be 30.
55% of Democratic voters say Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but this figure has fallen from 78 percent last month.
By this standard, Biden remains far away, but the proportion of those who think he is the most voting has grown.
However, when the Democratic voters were asked what was the most important thing about the candidate, they put opinions ahead of voting.
Also last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate was considered to be an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates do well on certain key issues among their party voters.
Most think Clinton, Sanders and Biden are honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden is best off the trio in honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
Thirty per cent of Democratic voters say they don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, which is twice as much as Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent say they don't have an opinion about Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally agree with Clinton, Sanders and Biden.
When you look at all these things, about a quarter of Democratic voters say they have no opinion about Sanders.
Although the use of Hillary Clinton's personal email address and server while he is a foreign minister still raises questions, most Democratic voters are satisfied with his explanation of the matter and say it did not affect their general opinion about him.
But it's different when you look at America as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now unhappy with his explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
The public's opinions were divided in March shortly after the matter came to light.
Most Americans say that e-mail polemics didn't affect their overall opinion of Clinton, even though 36 percent say their opinion of him has deteriorated.
More than six out of ten Republicans say their opinion of Clinton has become worse.
Even though Clinton's own party voters think he is honest and trustworthy, this is still a problem for him among all registered voters, only 32 percent think he is honest and trustworthy, and this figure has dropped by 8 percentage points since last month and 15 percentage points since May.
62 percent of registered voters say they don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 per cent of the country's registered voters do not think Trump is honest and trustworthy either.
But both Clinton and Trump are considered to be good leaders.
The six candidates in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush, are considered the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered honest, but many do not have an opinion about him, just like Carson does.
The margin of error in a study involving 351 Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in a national poll
Ben Carson comes close to Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
Two candidates gathered half of all the votes in the new poll, leaving others to fight for a foothold.
Republican voters across the country are still strongly in favour of Trump, whose support has risen to 27 per cent of the previous CBS poll published on Tuesday, before last month's Fox News election debate.
At the same time, though, Carson has skyrocketed from 6% to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well with different demographic groups and is replacing Trump with high-level Republican voters.
The rest of the field has been left behind, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio governor John Kasich, and Wisconsin governor Scott Walker's support has fallen most: from 10 percent last month to the current 2 percent.
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and florida Senator Marco Rubio are even third in the sixth percent.
The margin of error in the sample of this latest poll of 376 Republican voters in September is +/- 6 per cent.
Last week's CNN/ORC poll showed Carson's rise in polls: he has 19 percent support among Republicans, and Trump is 32% ahead of him.
Also according to the latest ABC News/Washington Post survey, Trump was well ahead of Carson.
With Carson's popularity rising last week, Trump criticised the retired neurosurgeon for nothing, even though he apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during his campaign visit to Iowa.
Five members of the fraternity are charged with the death of a first-year student at Baruch College
Nearly two years after the student died at the fraternity hazing ceremony in the Pocono Mountains District of Pennsylvania, the murder charge has been filed against five people.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity of Baruch College, New York City, brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the membership dispute in September 2013, and then stalled in taking him to hospital, thus contributing to his death, the police said.
Officials say Deng's eyes were tied and his back was loaded with a 13-pound backpack full of sand, after which he was repeatedly tackled to the ground as he tried to walk through an icy field towards the finish line.
Finally, Deng complained that his head hurt, after which he lost consciousness.
The members of the fraternity did not call 911 after Deng fainted, but said they waited an hour before bringing him to the hospital, the police said.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, look online for information about his symptoms, and contact the brotherhood's national chairman Andy Meng, asking him for advice, said chief of police Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"This is where the members began to hide their ritual equipment and thus practically put the brotherhood's welfare ahead of Michael Deng," said Chief Wagner.
Deng could not be revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was able to get repeated blunt force traumas to the head, body and thighs.
"Too many families have had to suffer from fraternisation, when at least one student has died every year since 1970," Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in his statement.
The brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is important.
Monroe County's grand jury was in favour of the first five members being charged with murder in third grade
32 other members of the brotherhood, including Meng, are also charged with violent hazing and criminal scheming.
"We don't just want individuals to be held accountable, and if there is an organisation behind what happened that either officially or unofficially accepted the situation, they should also be held accountable," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity, and the national brotherhood disbanded its connection to the local department.
This is what happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
The interest rate increase will come and the market for rising rates will fall, bond yields will rise and the economy will be in recession.
This is what we know.
What we don't know is how long it will take for all of this to take or how long it will take.
The past doesn't give much help with timing, especially when it comes to the economy.
The recession has lasted only 11 months since the first lift, and sometimes it has taken as long as 86 months.
The U.S. Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising interest rates has often, though not always, been a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
That is why officials at the U.S. Federal Reserve have so vigorously stressed that investors should not focus on that, because interest rates are being raised, but rather on the development cycle of the period leading to normalisation.
There are indeed several variables in the equation.
In the end, however, market participants can see that all the fuss about interest rate hikes has been oversized.
"The central bank's first increase since the global economic crisis will inevitably be interpreted in some circles as the end of the era of 'cheap money'," said Julian Jessop, chief economics expert at Capital Economics in a message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect the progressive return of US interest rates to normal, albeit still low, levels to be a revolutionary shock that many seem to fear.
This does not mean, however, that it does not have an effect.
Below is an overview of how some sectors of the economy will react in the light of past developments:
As the market has seen in the last about a month, waiting for the interest rate increase can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
"It seems that the return on capital tends to stop 12-24 months after the first raise, possibly reflecting a delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what will happen after the central bank's increase.
More specifically, in the last 35 years or so, the market is generally strong, about 14 percent up as we approach the increase, 250 days after that the situation is fairly steady (average increase of 2.6 percent), and normal conditions have been achieved after 500 days with average returns in the last six cycles of 14.4%, reports the latest analysis by Bob Doll, who is leading the capital strategy of Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on the shares is usually clearer at a later stage of the increase cycle as profits begin to fall.
The recessions are part of the economy, but interest rates often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces certain challenges that have not previously existed and that can accelerate the recession.
This is especially true of gross domestic product, which will be closest to its lowest level ever before the central bank's interest rate increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 increases since 1950 the nominal annual GDP has only twice been below 4.5%.
Although in the second quarter of 2015, the figure was 3.6 per cent, few think it will remain after the third quarter has progressed by 1.5 per cent, says Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economy can be risky and raise the question of whether this time is different," Deutsche Bank said.
The market participants have been preparing to raise the Fed throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the committee can approve the increase at this meeting, futures trade only predicts a 25 percent probability.
"Our research shows that since 1950, all the upturn cycles have so far appeared in the supercycles of an increasing leverage effect, where GDP has passed its peaks before the recession very quickly after recovery has begun," the report says.
On the other hand, there has been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst in the observation period.
In the current cycle, the Fed has expected by far the longest since the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and now the 74th month is already underway.
The fixed return has also been unstable while the market is waiting to raise interest rates, and the model is somewhat similar to the observations made about capital.
The main difference is that when the Central Bank changes its line, its effects are seen more quickly in bonds than in shares.
The direction of bond yields seems to change immediately at the first raise/cut of the cycle.
At the end of the raise cycle, the bond yields will fall immediately," Deutche Bank said.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that raising interest rates will result in convergence of yields on longer and shorter-term bonds, thus smoothing the yield curve.
High-yield bonds often produce better in a situation like this, even though "we are still cautious about looking for a profit," Schwab's solid income analyst Kathy Jones said in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the Fed's policy expectations.
"In addition to the dollar's strength and inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the outlook for tighter monetary policy," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is evener, credit margins have increased and volatility has increased - all of these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its policy.
Generally speaking, companies whose business is mainly located in the United States will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt do worse when the dollar's rise makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than they have funding.
"History shows that 'quality' shares are usually more profitable in the three months after the first rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in their customer report.
Companies with strong turnover passed weak turnover after increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with high capital return and low volatility shares performed better than lower-quality companies, the first average being 4 (percentage points) and the latter 3 (percentage points).
The debt is going to be a big problem.
The companies that have a lot of variable rate debt are losing the most, Goldman said.
Outside of stock market speculation, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from the dollar's rise in value.
Savers can also make a profit with higher profits, even though experts disagree about how quickly the impact will feel.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accuses the channel of "recognizance"
He claims that separating it from a commercial competitor is becoming increasingly difficult
He also targeted BBC Music Awards, saying they were just copying Brit Awards
MP Damien Collins criticized The Voice saying that neither was original
BBC Radio 3 is "changing" to Classic FM, claims the leading MP, adding pressure from the production company to prove it's doing something that commercial production companies don't do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC leaders that the public service radio channel seemed to "recognise" its content and that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish it from a commercial competitor.
"It seems like Radio 3 - I don't want to use the term "demographic" - is turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
"The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, only look like a Brit Awards gala under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different, here are two examples that I remember directly, that you're actually just copying something that's already on the market," Bingham said.
The BBC director-general denied the charges, claiming BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival in terms of live music and information sharing to the public.
Radio 3 teaches things about classical music that I can't learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is, in fact, first-class.
"I also think it is very important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 chief, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel had to do more work than before to reach the audience, because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC's offer that was criticised for stepping on the toes of commercial competitors during the hearing of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Conservative Tory MP Damien Collins criticised The Voice, a music contest that the BBC purchased from a Dutch production company Talpa Media for £22 million, according to estimates.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and is not unique?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 programme, with Paloma Faith and Boy George as star judges, has been produced "in a BBC style."
He added that he wants the production company to "find success inside its own house" the next time it starts an entertainment series.
He did not, however, agree to prevent the production of future The Voice seasons, or to prescribe that the money of the consentors be used for other entertainment formats.
Online sales so far rose least in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Online sales rose 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
The rise last month was lowest after the start of the statistics in 2000
Three years ago online sales were reinforced by the use of mobile devices to make purchases
Experts believe that November's Black Friday might curb consumption
Virtual shopping has grown dramatically for over a decade and has turned many of Britain's shopping streets into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs of a levelling-out of online sales, as the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
Total August consumption grew least since the beginning of the statistics in 2000: only five per cent up from last year.
Experts say there are signs of smoothing online sales, as the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
"If you look at the growth levels of previous years and go back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would become more rational over time," Andy Mulcahy, a reporter for the JMRG sales index, told Guardian.
He explained that three years ago online sales got stronger when buyers started using their mobile phones to shop.
It meant that more people were shopping online, and they could be doing it in different environments, such as on the couch.
But now it evens out, and (growth) can decrease.
Black Friday has been seen as one of the reasons behind slowing down shops.
Experts believe consumers will curb shopping before the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times more buyers flocked to their computers to grab shops, knocking down many retailers' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, who caused buyers to argue about the findings, can curb shopping
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one pound of five were used online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now made online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of using fashion chains on shopping streets.
Muslims bury the dead in Mecca's crane accident, consequences for Bin Laden family
Muslims carried 29 dead bodies across the streets during the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the collapse on the building giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured as the crane collapsed
29 dead were carried through the streets in the air as hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them, and the victims died when the crane collapsed in Mecca's Grand Mosque.
Mainly white-dressed mourners filled the route to honor the first of the dead who made their final journey to Al-Moaissem cemetery.
A sad procession passed a sacred place, where just a few days ago the crane fell through the mosque roof and knocked down worshipers.
The bodies were released for burial when the king of Saudi Arabia confirmed the Bin Laden family building group guilty of a disaster, which also injured 394 people.
Of the worshipers killed by cranes in Mecca's Grand Mosque, 29 bodies were carried across the streets
Among the dead were the father of four children from Qasim Akram Bolton, Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have already sworn that Hajj Mecca will continue as thousands continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman said Binladin Group should not have left the crane arm up when it was not in use.
The Arabic version of the decision, published by the state-led Saudi Press Agency, said Binladin Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The news agency's English service did not mention this detail, but it said that the company's directors have been banned from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week Salman vowed to find out what caused the crane to fall in the Grand Mosque yard, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered before the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not published any communications about the collapse of the crane, and its representatives have not been caught for comment.
The royal decision also accused the group of not using up-to-date safeguards and did not cooperate with meteorologists.
There are dozens of cranes around Mecca's Grand Mosque, which are part of the huge building robbery run by Binladin Group.
Binladin's family has been close to Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades, leading major construction projects.
Al-Qaeda's late leader, Osama bin Laden, was a rebellious boy whose family banned him in the 1990s.
The collapse took place in windy and rainy weather just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for a pilgrimage that every capable Muslim must do at least once in his life.
Authorities say 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities ordered a million rials (174,000 pounds) to be paid to the relatives of the dead and to the permanently injured.
The other injured get half of this amount.
B&Q boss says East European low-cost workers are behind the popularity
The British use more and more helpers, Veronique Laury says
The number of professionals coming from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
As a result, 200 more Screwfix shops for professionals will be opened
Meanwhile, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores across the country
Author Rupert Steiner, city chief correspondent for Daily Mail
Britons are said to give up hammers and paintpants and hire skilled Eastern European workers to do home repairs
It seems that if you are clever with a hammer or beat up to paint walls, you are now in a minority.
After all, the British hire more and more helpers to do the do-it-yourself work in their homes, says the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new president of Kingfisher, who owns the home-renovation chain, said that behind the popularity is the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and that they offer their services at a low price.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Crewfix stores for workers and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said she wants more women to work at B&Q stores, because eight out of ten shopping decisions made in the store are specifically made by a more beautiful gender.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said the changes in the population must be taken into account: there are now more one-woman households with more home renovations than before.
Laury said: "Most of the staff in our stores are still men.
We need to find a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80 per cent of the purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of only five women who run the most important companies in the British FTSE100 index, and has rebuilt her management team with equal numbers of male and female supervisors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in the group that has exactly 50 per cent of women, including its chief executive and financial director.
Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important thing here.
It has not been difficult to find good women for the management team."
Kingfisher announced a decrease in both six months' profits and sales after the group took the cost of closing the stores.
As a result of trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new stores
The three aces government decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
The visible effects were obtained quite quickly.
The sharp head of SAK and other employee centre organisations began to force immediately, and as a result, the country stands on Friday because of the workers' widespread demonstration.
A lot of people think that there is also reason at that time.
Let's see if it's a good idea to strike when things are going badly.
Even the resistance movement has been set up.
More than 50,000 people have already been online to announce that they are not going to take part in the demonstration but are going to work.
In an old time of good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no internet to protest about, but openly declaring a criminal would have been a small person's political suicide.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of millions of trade unions does not give much thought, but it gives cause for thought.
The status of the trade union movement is no longer as obvious as it was a couple of decades ago.
Not everyone knows the movement's goals as their own, the values have changed
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay movement, the government's harsh solutions can also be seen as a direct celestial gift.
When things have seemed to roll in their own weight for years, now the unions finally get to the point of defending the employee's rights, visiblely and properly.
In this way, the government may want to incarcerate the role of the AY movement, as membership of the trade union may be seen as more necessary than before.
Whatever you think of the organisations' actions, it's nonsense that Friday's demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has already stopped long ago.
For example, industrial output has been falling for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product will continue to decline, and unemployment will rise.
These things should force everyone's mind.
Lappeenranta University's hard-earned savings: The goal is to save 8.5 million, with 130 staff cuts
Lappeenranta University of Technology begins a savings course with the goal of reducing costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start negotiations on the whole staff, with a savings target of 6.5 million annually.
In practice, it means reducing about 130 employees.
In addition, two million will be saved from other activities.
The background to the Yt negotiations is the 2016 budget, which anticipates a real deficit of 8.5 million.
It is also affected by the government's budget cuts.
In this financial year, the university will result in a deficit of about 2.6 million.
The costs will increase slightly next year, but at the same time the funding from the Ministry will decrease by 2 million and the rest will decrease by 3.2 million euros.
The university's total budget is about 85 million euros, so the savings target is 10 per cent of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive cuts in education and research and the reduction in corporate funding for our university is very significant, says Principal Anneli Pauli in a university press release.
Before the summer, the impact of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in additional funding appears in new proportions.
The negotiations with the shop stewards will start on Tuesday next week and they will last the six weeks laid down by the law.
Yle: Onnibus wants to use Finnish railways
The owner of the cheap bus company Onnibus, British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company is also aiming for rail traffic in Finland.
I am very interested in joining Finnish rail traffic.
My Stagecoach company is one of Britain's largest railway companies, Souter says.
Rail transport should gradually open up to competition.
First up is local traffic in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in 2017-2018.
After commuter traffic, long-distance traffic is on the line.
Souter says he has already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes Onnibus plans.
At least Transdev (formerly Veolia), who also has bus traffic in Finland and rail traffic elsewhere in Europe, has expressed interest in other international companies for rail traffic.
The U.S. Federal Reserve has to make decisions about interest rates
The rest of the world will stand by as the Federal Reserve meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision about whether they will raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
When Reuters polled 80 economists, just over half of those who thought last week the Fed would raise interest rates now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and the interest rates are kept at the current 0-0.25 percent.
This is a historic event, because it is seven years since the Central Bank cut its interest rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank has the opportunity to get out of zero and start normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Peterson Institute for International Economics Senior Fellow.
The U.S. economy has worked relatively well, and the recovery has brought billions of dollars to the balance sheets and created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
It has warned the market that they should be ready for a lift, but the signs also show that they believe that the odds are against the raise.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 8 pm (CET).
Delta State University shooter left an apology note
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - before shooting her colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he was "bad" about the first murder and hoped "that he could cancel it," the authorities said on Tuesday.
Mississippi Gautier Police said that Delta State University geography and social science teacher Lamb called 911 at about 10 a.m.
Monday, he said he shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police must send officers to his home.
He said he "killed his wife last night" and also mentioned that there was a "sweet dog" in the house that "does not disturb anyone" but is probably shocked.
The police asked the caller his name, but he didn't say it.
Lamb didn't give an explanation for the shooting.
When the police got there, there was found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a note written by 45-year-old Lamb that said: "I'm so sorry I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy, and she was the only person who ever loved me."
After writing the message, Lamb drove nearly 500 kilometres to Delta State, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt, before finally killing himself late Monday while being surrounded by police.
University principal William LaForge said there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt as far as he knew, but that " clearly there was something in Lamb's mind."
The authorities said on Tuesday that despite the claims published on Monday that Lamb believed Prentiss was related to Schmidt, there was "no information or evidence" of any kind of "triangular drama."
Shawn O'Steen said he was married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as a "good person."
The couple broke up 15 years ago, but they stayed friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who is "strung."
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "over all the best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked from home online, and according to Sun Herald, Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
The police said Lamb called her relatives somewhere on Monday to tell them "she won't go to jail."
When the police reached Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb pulled his car over, left it there, and ran into the woods where he shot himself.
Lamb argued education science at Delta State in spring 2015, says the CV found on the university website.
Stars who lost their charm
The actor (left), with his son Redmond (right), has had a hard time in recent years.
In 2001, he suffered from leukemia, and in 2009, his long-time partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
Rumor has it he has also had drug problems, and in 2008, he was arrested for drug possession.
All of this really takes its toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw is out for months because of a double fracture
Luke Shaw had a double fracture to his right leg as Manchester United destroyed PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League match.
Even though the defender stayed in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by Héctor Moreno's reckless tackle at 15 minutes after 20-year-old Shaw crashed into the PSV area.
He was treated for nine minutes in the field and had to be given oxygen before going to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double fracture in his leg and is now in hospital."
He'll be moved tomorrow or maybe the day after, and then he'll have surgery in Manchester.
The boy comes to Manchester United when he's 18, gets into trouble and then plays brilliantly, and this is what's happening.
When I was in the dressing room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture will take at least six months, and he won't play in the block phase.
I hope he gets to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky to get a red card and a penalty shot.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian trustee erred.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say it became a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-foot tackle.
Shaw tweeted: "Thank you all for your messages, words are not enough to tell how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I'll come back stronger."

The English defender has an additional incentive to recover from next June's European Championships in France.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's a really bad injury."
If a player is forced out because of such an injury, everyone is very sad.
Our players are never meant to offend the opponent.
Moreno's leg was broken when he played against Van Gaal's Holland in the 2014 World Championships in Mexico.
"Moreno takes this hard because it's not meant to hurt your opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, it's bad," Cocu said.
I didn't see it in that situation.
The only thing I saw was the ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn't see Luke tackle.
Moreno said to SBS6: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel terrible about this, I'm so sorry."
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after Chris Smalling sued him.
David Cameron knows Lorax better than this, right?
Every parent soon learns something: If your child loves a book, it won't take long to learn it almost by heart.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When the holiday-time childcare service asked the Prime Minister for his favourite children's book, he chose Dr. Seuss's book The Lorax, an environmental story published in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message published on the SuperCamps website and continues: "A fun, moving, creative and contains a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children because it always seems to be a picture or a message we have never seen before."
All of this is true, but the next paragraph, where Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book, is a summary of the 2012 film version, where new characters and details had been added to the rather short original text.
"In the city of Nellen, where all nature has disappeared and even the air is a commodity, Ted boy hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams by fulfilling Audrey's wish to see a real tree," the text says and describes a love story that Dr Seuss, who died in 1991, did not write, the real name Theodor Seuss Geisel.
If this isn't suspicious enough, Cameron's text in some places sounds like it was taken from a plot summary of the Lorax movie found on the Internet Movie Database website, starting with: "In the city of Nellen, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, Ted boy hopes to win over the heart of his dream girl Audrey."
Given Cameron's public activity as a parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so unacquainted with the plot of the book, where a young, anonymous boy hears how the local nature has been destroyed by a greedy, wood-crushing and needy Kerskanen, ignoring the short, mustached creature that named the story, Lorax, who "speaks for the trees."
Such a relatively invisible PR assignment has probably been outsourced to an assistant who apparently has never read a book 20 times in a row to a child.
The Prime Minister's spokesman said the text must have come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment further at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being sidetracked from England's team, but it was still a tough spot
Playing against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for the tour, I don't think it's likely that the 3-0 series loss that happened last time will happen again.
I wouldn't rule out a guest win.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than a three-year-old team, but there are good spinners and the team's thinking is strong: they don't have scars from 2012, just youthful positivity.
Moeen Ali develops in its spiral feeds, and Adil Rashid is an attacker, even though he is an unknown factor at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from England's cricket team, replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth's team is understandably difficult to analyse for me, because I'm his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been against good attackers in challenging conditions, and the simple but harsh truth is that cricket players are judged by their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root's choice before the announcement, because, as I have said before, players are the best choice makers.
About a hundred points more, and Lyth's season on the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own fate.
Hopefully, if he gets more runs for Yorkshire, there will be a second chance.
England's head coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth's attitude even when he wasn't doing as well as he could and that doesn't surprise me. Lyth is above all a team player.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long a hitter gets to leave a mark.
Lyth was elected seven times to the national team, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton got the chance to play both at home and at guests.
The only complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott first for the Caribbean when Lyth was in top shape, but that missed opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes along, and there's a hitter I appreciate.
As a cricket player, he has what we saw early this season in Yorkshire when he scored 236 points against us on Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same chance as the others before him, but of course this depends on the team's composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen in an opening next to Cook has been splattered, making it an extra pitcher but keeping four fast, and I am not against this.
I don't understand why a hitter couldn't hit there, and this left-handed one has already shown himself to be quite a cricket player.
Moeen did not necessarily do his duty in his county in Worcestershire, but he is their third and there is little difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games with the first roll down before moving on to the opening in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points and did not remember the past.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a back-up pitcher, and, just what I've been dealing with him, he feels like a very impressive young man.
People can watch his unpretentious statistics - hitting the average 31, with the ball 35 - and think it's a gamble, but there are not too many pitchers and voters chose young people.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few tough additions to the coach side.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, a Sri Lankan hitter, as a consultant to the games may prove to be a genius.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game and brings with him a huge amount of experience because he has done everything in all situations and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood joins in the white ball games, bringing both energy and a ruthless glimpse.
I've always thought he was born to be a part of international cricket, whether it's playing or coaching, and he's got the kind of brain that Mahela uses.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's teammate Durham, Ben Stokes, is resting at one-days, Root was given a similar break from Australia, and I certainly have no problem with that.
Even though not everyone agrees, coaches and selectors don't make schedules.
And you have to remember that just like the players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions are never made lightly.
Britain's departure from the EU (Brexit) can win if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron's half-baked renegotiation strategies to keep Britain in the EU are becoming increasingly problematic every day, even without even taking into account the cordial Jeremy "Is it a yes or a no?" Corbyn's choice of Labour leadership or the union union's anger at Europe on Tuesday.
The foreigners also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farage.
A European diplomat recently explained that, because the EU is so deep in various crises, not all of which are its own fault, some Member States are fed up with the self-centered British agenda, which is full of discordant concessions and disturbing treaty changes that they do not want for the most part.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the trade union association decided that they would not want them either, if they undermine social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's selfieagenda.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, taking a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, either with or without the local eye, and then coming home to say they are winning backers for reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outward inside Britain's EU tent - 'Don't leave us alone with France', says Berlin - suggests that the short-sighted ministers and officials of certain capitals are now at a point where they don't care if we leave.
Germany's cautious and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave before it gets ruined in the same way that it did for Thatcher, who stayed too long (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French François Hollande will be re-elected or replaced in 2017.
He, too, is a fleeting force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain has a left-wing government.
It's hard to see these countries sacrifice themselves for the Selfies, when their energy should rather be directed at preventing Scotland from leaving the UK - they don't want it either because of similar separatist tendencies.
So, my friend suggests, some of these ministers may even consciously plan to make useless remarks in the Scottish National Party style during the British referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Brexit process.
"The renegotiations were arranged," and "The renegotiations didn't matter to Britain."
Europeans have had a bitter experience of how gluttonous Fleet Street newspapers can be and how sceptics of the press are, what they were not during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, when our 1973 membership was confirmed in the ratio number 2:1.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the biggest Euro opportunist who named himself by writing "EU straight bananas" when he was a Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a diverse group of tax-guesting rascals, phones-hacking foreigners, and people who have their nominal place of residence elsewhere and who own most of our big newspapers.
Tony Blair actually felt the same way about them, but he realized that if you're in a cage with a horny gorilla, you have to give up bananas because of the deception, if you don't want to be on that gorilla's lunch menu and later on at dinner.
In fact, Miliband was moreblair than Blair himself, as regards opposing Cameron's renegotiation act, because Bair had agreed to the principle behind the rejected EU constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But a nice Jeremy Corby who kindly patted me on the back at Westminster Parliamentary House on Monday (I told him he no longer has time to waste on me) seems to be in danger of re-accepting Neil Kinnock's 1980s boycott of Murdoch, which was a mistake both then and now.
Even though it may take time, he is forced to develop a consistent strategy to keep in touch with the media, not me, but undoubtedly Andrew Marr, whose BBC couch Corby left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, to put it nicely, evolving.
He says he wants us to stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside the UK Independence Party Ukipi's war goal enthusiasm and the most fierce nationalists in the Conservative Party can certainly take up this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn, fan" Benn said this on both radio and on TV this week, when his inner patrolman wanted to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint rugged John McDonnell as shadow government finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his father-in-law struggled on TV to try to be disloyal to his Labour government colleagues without going too far to lose his position of government.
Hilary's struggles were more appealing.
But the fight to keep up with "any situation" - Benn's comment - was not what McDonnell said, or, from all accounts, what Corbyn told the chiefs and MPs at a private meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever the unhierarchy, emotional and personal image Corbyn wants to convey (remember that he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important in the era of 24-hour television, and especially in social media twists, which is an acceptable breeding ground for paranoia and fraud.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to take Labour support in the referendum campaign for granted.
At least Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic tour of EU membership (and in line with their Benn-minded regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a hard-to-understood discussion among left-wing fellows for whom the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma in doctrinal bickering.
As for his duality with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby is not campaigning to give up), foreign diplomats simply have to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they also have suspicious voters) on concessions to Britain when it can be completely pointless?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed by the British's weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with the cost-cutting conservative government in power, as I was reminded at the start of Monday's British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticized Public Health England's e-cigarette review
Researchers have said that the state-funded agency's claim that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than conventional ones originated from a 12-person meeting, some of which had links to the tobacco industry.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on electro-cigarette.
PHE published this "stamp" report last month, describing it as "a comprehensive review of the evidence."
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of the data and have pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, the medical journal Lancet published an editorial that attacked PHE's main conclusion against the "exceptionally brittle base."
The other two researchers who wrote in the BMJ have wondered whether the claims were "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, European Public Health Professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, University of Liverpool's clinical epidemiology professor, say: "The main principle of national health is that policies must be based on proven effectiveness."
They say that the public expects that the PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes" is based on a detailed assessment and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from one meeting of 12 people, where a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) was developed to synthesise their opinions about the disadvantages associated with various nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarised in the study.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors at the meeting was the company's name EuroSwiss Health, whose director-general is said to have previously received funding from Bristish American Tobacco for independent research.
He also supported BAT's public health powers in the sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 people at the meeting said they had received funding from an electric tobacco manufacturer, but not the money he was said to have received earlier from Philip Morris International, they are adding.
There are no criteria for selecting panel members, but the panel includes a number of well-known e-cigarette supporters, some of whom also say they have received funding from the industry in the study.
Others present are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE's tobacco director.
The research produced by the group "manyly admits" that there is a lack of "incontrovertible evidence about the disadvantages in most products and most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these connections or restrictions are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say PHE's claims that "there is no evidence for now that electronic cigarettes serve as a route to smoking with children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, the head of PHE's health and well-being, said the claims made at the BMJ have been answered earlier.
He says: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
Half of those who smoke their lives die of addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks caused by e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it doesn't show, especially when there is so much public uncertainty about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related illness, and smoking costs NHS £2 billion a year.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, even though e-cigarettes are not risk-free, their disadvantages are only a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco - we are fulfilling our national responsibilities.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 director
Former Channel 4 president Luke Johnson has said that BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial rivals would "give anything" about such hits as this soap show on Albert Square, for example.
Johnson said the licence fees should only be used to make programmes that other British broadcasters do not do.
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes that are likely to have a smaller audience on difficult broadcasts against the most watched programmes of competitors and on such channels as BBC4.
After the BBC president Tony Hall said the company wanted to cooperate more with other organisations, Johnson said he tried to establish a relationship with the BBC for six years, in vain.
"I don't understand the idea that the BBC produces and broadcasts programmes that would be clearly suitable for unsubvented competitors," Johnson said to the Upper House Communications Committee as part of its study of the BBC's future.
If the licence fee is adhered to - and I am not sure it would be a good idea for this media or in the long term - it should at least limit its production to programmes that others do not do and produce.
The Voice will be sent to the most important broadcast time, because they want to collect as much support as possible for its future.
The idea of no one else showing the show is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why a regressive tax should fund programmes that could also be funded without state subsidies.
The Voice is one of them and the EastEnders is another, admittedly executed inside the house.
Frankly, other channels would give anything about it.
I don't understand how it's about a public service broadcast.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC at all."
The serial entrepreneur Johnson, who led Channel 4 in 2004-2010, said the BBC is guilty of hunting ratings "because of the goals of people working there, and because they believe it is the best way to achieve long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular series are similar to those of former Sky leader Tony Ball, who used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC sell such shows as EastEnders.
Johnson said the BBC's smaller audience's public service programmes "go to BBC4, where the number of viewers cannot often be measured, but the BBC thus fulfills its responsibilities and then, in defending £4 billion in licence fees, can hypocritically state that 'of course, we are doing all these unknown programs that no one is watching'.
They put them on a mission site where no one ever comes to see them.
As to the licence fee, Johnson told the committee: "I challenge you to find a more regressive system of who gets the most value from it.
Of course you all think, we all think that £150 a year gets a lot of value, but I don't know if that's true for those people for whom £150 is a lot of money, because they don't use much BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 leader David Elstein, who also witnessed to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should re-assess its Reith-time mission "to inform, train and entertain."
He said that only a small percentage of BBC production is now classified as education - he said the numbers are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and should take the lead from Australian and Canadian broadcasts and change the task to "to inform, educate and entertain."
As for the partnership issues, Elstein said the BBC should focus more on events such as Proms concerts, which he said only a few people will be shown on television, and join with commercial companies to make them all accessible online.
"Audiogenetics" allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how nematode worms change direction as soon as the sound impulse hits them.
Researchers have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems to control them with sound waves.
The tiny nematode worms change direction as soon as they are hit by a sound impulse that is too high to be heard by the human ear.
The impulses work by switching on genetically modified motion nerve cells with membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves.
Related: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
Researchers said the worms show a new method called sound genetics, where ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the method could one day replace deep-brain stimulation, a invasive procedure that leads electrical impulses to people's brains to treat Parkinson's disease.
The shuttles do not normally react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles strengthened ultrasound waves, which then flow inside the worms.
Confirmed ultrasound waves affect TRP-4 ion channels, structures found in the cell membranes of some worms.
The sound waves cause these ion channels to open up and activate the cells attached to them, says a report published in Nature Communications.
To produce nematode-controlled nematode worms, Chalasani genetically modified the worms, some of which have TRP-4 ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasound on modified worms, microbubbles strengthened sound waves and transmitted them to the worms where they turned on modified motion nerve cells.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to switch on and off nerve cells using light impulses.
However, Chalasani says that sonogenetics may have some advantages over optogenetics.
Unlike the light that has to be sent along the optical fiber to the desired place inside the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through the tissue unhindered, so they can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus may make it possible to cause the target human neurons to react temporarily to an ultrasound signal in certain neurological treatments in a clinical environment," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

Advertising puts Britain's arms trade to shame
Watch Amnesty International's anti-arms fair video.
Horrible killer planes!
Leghold traps crushing ankles!
Grape bombs!
And electric stunning batons that cause painful pain but leave no trace!
A joyful voice and cartoon imagery leaves no doubt that this advert of the world's largest arms fair is a sharp parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to trade arms to repressive regimes at the Defence and Security Equipment International's ExCeL Centre in the London shipyard area.

With a separate campaign, many posters also appeared at bus stops and metro trains requiring a closer look.
"Important information, Do you travel on the DLR route from 15 to 18 September?" together is asked using London's underground font and brand, as the DLR track turns into a tank image.
In this September, a bunch of arms dealers arrive on the DLR route... customers are asked to help stop the gun fair.
These 300 posters are made by artists whose works were displayed at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksy's Dismaland (Museum of Cruel Plans).
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped to spread posters across London using "Ad Space Hack Packs" packages, a six-pound package of hexagon keys that, according to the collective, "can reach a third of the planet's bus stop advertising space."
Transport for London is not amused by this unauthorised "proclaimed vandalism."
One of the parody ads produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Cruel Designs curator and University of Essex lecturer Gavin Grindon, artists are increasingly questioning and want to take political work to outside the galleries.
A lot of artists have started working with activists in resistance chests when they realized they have to go to the outside world if they want their art to affect society.
Another anti-arms poster greets commuters on the subway.
Amnesty's video has been watched over 100,000 times over the last 24 hours, created free by the ad agency VCCP, and also by a graphic designer and background researcher.
VCCP's creative director Matt Lever found that the gun fair was not advertised at all - and also there was an empty section on ExCeL's calendar then - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They were playing with the idea of a more realistic advertising of obscure corporate governance, but "it was more stopping to stress the issue with bright colors and animation."
"They have done fantastic work to help us raise questions about illegal torture equipment sold at the fair," says Amnesty Tom Davies.
Now the British Government must take action to ensure that torture equipment is not illegally sold near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art in connection with the gun fair comes from inside ExCeL, when exhibitors sell fantastically embellished products.
In a press release, Saab revealed that he had received an order from the U.S. military for "At4CS RS to launch from the shoulder."
This includes "a unique pipe bethead that targets excellent effects behind the armor inside the target."
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student dormitory
It's been 11 years since I was an ignorant 19-year-old and moved to a dormitory, and I still believed in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the forced smiles of the people I irritated - and numerous, long complaints about others.
Much of what I've learned can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving to a dormitory can be anything from a nerve to a completely scary one.
It's tempting to babble: to tell where you are from, whether you liked a year off, and where you think about Corbyn, and why "I don't really love or hate Marmite because it's really just yeast extract HAHAHA to find me in my room."
Breathe.
And help others to breathe - ask questions and show interest.
It will guide the conversation and help you find the people you like, not the people you don't want to talk to, even if your eyelashes are on fire and they're handing out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms often turn into cocktail parties, movie evenings and public entertainment, but they are also the places where people dress and mend their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about starting a university when you're in a relationship
The university is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but many dormitories form a culture of room-to-room travel that is friendly, social and creates lifelong friendships.
It could mean hell to someone who's trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you permission to say, "I like you and I want to be friends with you, but you have to leave now so I can recover the energy I spent talking to you."
Try to sense when a student friend is tired of socializing - and maybe send a text message to the door instead of knocking.
Knocking when the speech came: knock.
A guy at my dorm said if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw some pretty good things.
Make friends through baking.
Since you're starting a university at the top of the baking trend, knocking on people's doors with a chocolate cupcake plate and introducing yourself seems a little less weird, less "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something for you, now smile when I ask you personal questions" from the '50s.
Offering self-made delicacies is a great way to make friends.
Your cohabiting partners feel obliged to talk, and it may be that they will link your face to a tasty surprise in the future.
Of course, this depends on whether you know how to bake.
Poorly mixed flour-sugar-fat lumps are likely to make people pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dormitories.
Understandably, taking a chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk for your tea?
Ask and check with the milk owner.
It's possible they'll give you permission even though they're boiling internally.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you get my sympathy - but try to treat it more adultly than my dorm buddy who mixed detergent in his milk to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
You should not make such noise that people cannot sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that proverbial pot beating the pot.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor if they could play their drum and bass music quieter, because it was three in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally shut up at 5 a.m., the girl kindly let them sleep for two hours before making their own music roar, locked her doors, and took a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dorm with you?
Or in reverse, wouldn't it be incredibly awkward for you to think of your dorm partner as your future spouse, get together, break up, and then see him every day and possibly lose all your mutual friends to him?
Of course the heart wants what it wants, but if the hot roommate is not really your future spouse, you could at least try to reason with your lower head.
In that exhilarating moment when you find that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between pranks and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good prank is fun, but can be cancelled in an instant.
You can teach a useful and fun lesson about safety by hiding something - but never mess up someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but don't put their property on the ceiling with a blue sticker more than twice.
A racist attack on a foreign student accommodation in Kitee - House planned as a reception centre was soiled in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack was carried out on the foreign students' accommodation in Kitee in North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, this is not a place to stay for underage asylum seekers, but a place to sleep for foreign students who have been in Finland longer, says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher at the Evankelinen folk high school in Kite.
The windows and walls of the folk high school accommodations were stained with racist signs, such as swastikas, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one of the accommodations, says the police of Eastern Finland.
According to Luukkainen, who is responsible for youth guarantee training at the folk high school, the building that was the target of vandalism had an estimated ten people at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and grown-up people are free to move, so some could have been elsewhere," Luukkainen says.
People from 12 different nationalities are staying at the folk high school.
They are students who have already been in Finland for some time, as well as newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
Everyone in the mess-up building has a status.
Some are studying in adult comprehensive school, some are in vocational studies, and some are studying Finnish," Luukkainen says.
A status is a so-called continuous residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has already been in Finland for some time.
The police in Eastern Finland are investigating the attack as an act of damage and a violation of home peace.
According to Luukkainen, there was a press conference for students on Monday, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There is no panic here, and no one has wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for over a decade, and this is the first time something like this has happened," Luukkainen says.
According to Luukkainen, the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
At least three men were suspected to have been involved and they had been travelling on a light car.
I think this is the whim of the youth's weekend night, when this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious than that," Luukkainen says.
In Salo, too, a hospital has been soiled, where a reception centre has been planned.
The incident happened last week.
MTV told about the matter on its website on Tuesday evening.
A swastika was drawn on the hospital wall and written in English "You are not welcome."
A police report has been filed.
Revision 15.9. at 4.02 p.m. Corrected incorrect information provided by the police about the age and status of the people living in the building.
The state is shutting down the Y train to Karjaa - the passengers are upset, "unintelligently idiotic"
The Y train from Helsinki to Raasepori Karjaa will stop running in March.
The news was indignant at the passengers on the beginning of the train at Helsinki main railway station.
Especially the downfall strikes the Siuntio people, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It's idiotic, because the population is growing and those who work need a fast and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This cannot depend on anything but political will - or lack of it.
Bengtström says on HSTV's interview video he's going to come to the capital with a tractor.
There are also train changes elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H- and R-trains running on the main track will be connected to the new R-line.
Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula will be disabled.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on which routes the Ministry will purchase train traffic during the next contract period.
The contract period will change at the turn of the year and there will be routes to be closed throughout the country.
The new four-year contract to be finalised in the autumn will later be approved by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Siuntiolainen Bengtström considers the state's train cutter to be short-sighted.
We make the same mistakes that have been made in the past and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then there will be regret.
The Y-train is also used by others other than the Raseporians and the Siuntians, because it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Annina Pöyry, from Espoo, was upset about the fate of those travelling farther away from the city area by train.
"It's especially bad for those who have to redeploy their journey," he said as he struggled with the Y train.
A little relief is coming.
There will probably be a new train connection to the beach, which will replace the Y train in the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL), i.e. take it all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This will increase the costs for HSL, i.e. practically the municipalities and their taxpayers in the region.
"We are now beginning to explore different options and their impact on the service level and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, HSL's CEO.
It is still impossible to estimate the costs accurately.
Rihtniemi says that, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about a million dollars a year for the Y train, the ministry certainly far more than that.
The R line on the main track misses two stations.
Instead, the number of trains will double in Ainola and Saunakallio.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease from the whole country.
The Ministry no longer buys train traffic on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Säinäjoki.
Pieksämäki-Joensuu route will be shortened to Pieksämäki-Parkus.
The train services will be reduced on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka harbour and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million journeys a year are made on stopping shifts, while the total number of journeys purchased by the Ministry is about nine million.
The new contract is supposed to bring the state savings of 12.3 million a year.
The value of the contract is about 27.5 million euros a year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in Capital's topicality book: "Marx is worth studying"
The crises in the global economy have brought up Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his lead in Capital, published in 1867-1894, writes Yrjö Hakanen, known as the former Chairman of the SKP, in his book Marx's Capital's topicality today.
"He is now taken more seriously than in a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx's estimates of the development of the capitalist economy, internationalisation and penetration into all walks of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of financial and imaginary capital have proved to be astonishingly farsighted.
The author list of the book based on the capital seminars organised by Hakase also includes a professor at Aalto University, the respected economic expert Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes Marx is topical "now and forever."
However, the former Chief Executive Officer of the Finnish Institute of Economics and the business delegation is not Marxist?
No, no, no, no.
Korkman says on the phone he doesn't think Marx is a topical economic thinker, but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, social sciences are differentiated and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary expert.
"The usual idea is that the history of the idea tells about the wrong opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
It is true that Marx's predictions went badly wrong.
Even though Marx understood the nature and meaning of the industrial revolution, he drew too far conclusions from the beginning of capitalism, Korkman ponders.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"The most relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he said.
Now we are talking again about Marx's interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may be able to give inspiration to anyone who wants to understand the big picture, the world that is changing as a result of a technical upheaval," Korkman analyses.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is not going to help.
After all, she said capitalism was a hopeless case that should just be stopped.
Still, Korkman thinks it's a good idea to study Marx.
"In the 70s, Marx could not be read," Korkman said.
"Maoists and Trotskyians and other sects all hated capitalism, but even more each other."
Today, the discussion is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political baggage of the past years.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's mindset - like other classics," Korkman says.
UN demands war criminals to be sentenced in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes committed in Sri Lanka's civil war, reports AFP.
The UN report on the civil war in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long postponement.
The report blames both the Sri Lankan armed forces for war crimes and the Tamil Tigers.
It is estimated that at least 100,000 people died in the Sri Lanka Civil War.
There is no precise information about the number of victims either.
Especially in the last months of the long war, the military's major attack in 2009 should be properly investigated, the UN report demands.
The report accuses Sri Lanka's armed forces of torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, the victims of which were as likely to be men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have been guilty of forcing bystanders and children to fight.
Both parties have committed murders, according to the report.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intends to organise the investigation itself, but does not intend to allow a UN court to be set up because foreign judges.
The English Yo experiment allowed you to weigh social media
On Wednesday, the student papers in the autumn had a long foreign language, most of which had English.
England's skills were tested by over 16,000 pledges.
In the experiment, you could write a paper about social media, for example.
Based on our own experiences, we had to wonder whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the writing of 150-250 words in English could be addressed to the director of the online magazine's advice column.
The headline was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is equivalent to the Finnish Leelia rest chair.
He asked for advice on how to get parents to look at things also for young people.
The total number of subjects was four, one of which had to be selected.
"It was the hardest of them," said Mia Lybeck, English lecturer at Porvoo's Swedish-speaking high school.
The third topic was just a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth topic was nice, according to Lybeck.
It had to write a fire speech to explain why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school, we've been practicing writing speeches," Lybeck says and estimates the whole experiment to be "unlikely."
In English - or Swedish - the English experiment allowed questions about texts that included adaptation of summer flounder to climate change and handling large data masses.
Some long Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written on Wednesday.
The autumn's articles will continue on Friday, when another Finnish or Finnish experiment will take place.
In upper secondary schools, the test is organised normally, meaning that the employees' demonstration does not affect it.
The matriculation examination board advises the candidates to find suitable transport connections in time to get to the trial.
You can also get extra time if you can prove that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
A shop was robbed in Oulu at gunpoint
A shop in the Kello district was robbed in Oulu on Wednesday morning.
According to the police, the robber was wearing dark clothes and a commando hat covering his face.
The man is normal and about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and caught a small amount of money.
The case is being investigated as a aggravated robbery.
Police prepare for tens of thousands of protesters arriving in Helsinki - support patrols from elsewhere in Finland
The protest against the government's cutting decisions will block the centre of Helsinki on Friday, the police predict.
According to preliminary information, as many as tens of thousands of people can arrive.
Members of SAK, Akava and STTK federations will meet at the Railway Square at 11 a.m.
Police officers are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
The task of the police at work is not only to carry out the alert tasks and other police operations, but also to ensure that the giant demonstration goes smoothly.
Roads leading to the railway market will be closed from motor vehicles between about 9.30 and 14 p.m.
Only emergency vehicles will be allowed in the area.
From Hakaniemi's direction, the traffic will be cut off at Kaisaniemi's roundabout, from the west to Mannerheimintie.
Are there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Chief Inspector Seppo Kujala?
At least for the time being, it looks like it's enough.
I don't take a stand about the police's industrial battle issues.
According to Kujala, there are support patrols coming to Helsinki from elsewhere in Finland because of the demonstration.
The police won't tell you the exact patrol numbers.
"Some things are coming, but as a rule we can manage on our own," Kujala says.
Police advise to avoid private driving in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic sum extends from Hakaniemi level to its core centre.
Standing traffic is expected from the early evening of the morning.
With protesters from other parts of Finland, a lot of charter buses are also coming to Helsinki.
They will not be allowed to the Railway Square.
In principle, the buses remain quite distant.
The rest of the journey then needs to be walked to the demonstration place," Kujala says.
The demonstration also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From the police's point of view, there is also a positive side to this.
The issue of the flow of public transport, which is normally at hand at these big people's gatherings, is now partly taken care of itself.
The protesters have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of government economic policy may come to Helsinki.
The police expect the demonstration to go peacefully.
After all, people are ordinary working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
After all, Finns are sensible and calm people," Kujala says.
There will also be local demonstrations in different parts of Finland on Friday.
Friday's demonstration is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is not a very good benchmark for it in Finnish political history, says Emeritus Siisiäinen, professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It is no wonder that the Ay movement protests.
If it didn't, it would raise your hands in front of the government, says Siisiäinen.
A very right-wing government has struck at the cores of Finnish corporatism tradition - and also at points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's tough grips are interfering with contract law.
There are a lot of features of trying to get the AY movement to its knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
The mirror is needed, for example, because the agency does not have the support of all employees for Friday's demonstrations.
What is new now is the sharp division that the demonstration will bring about among the members of the Ay movement who would like to take part in the demonstration.
The unemployed gathered from all over Finland protested at the Parliamentary House in November 1993.
If you're looking for a point of comparison for Friday's demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, called Murrostorstai, organized in 1993, says Siisiäinen.
In the middle of the deepest recession, Murrostorstai brought together 20,000 unemployed.
Esko Aho's (central) government stumbled from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relationship between the Finnish government and employee organisations had never before been as bad as that of Aho's bourgeois government.
Now the relationship between the government and the Ay movement may be even worse than in the time of Murrostorsta.
In addition, Finland's most bourgeois government is now in power, Siisiäinen says.
The current coalition of government is still interesting in such a way that it is so strict on the right, despite what the Finns said.
There were still certain elements of the old labour movement at the time.
Several thousand protesters are expected on Friday.
The demonstration also stops public transport and possibly closes kindergartens and schools.
Even though the demonstration does not receive undivided support from employees, it can become the biggest in years.
In recent years, about 300 demonstrations have been organised in Helsinki annually.
They're from side to side.
Traditionally, Finnish protests by the Ay movement have been quite calm - even though the policies have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, Finnish protest avoids conflict, we are law-abiding.
The protesters try to avoid damaging or destroying property, says Siisiäinen.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The demonstration culture changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and the police prepared to get pig shit on themselves.
The firefighters strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also spectacular strikes among pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electric strikes in the 1970s
The most significant strikes in the 1970s were a metal strike in 1971 and a power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
70,000 metal men took part in the metal men's strike.
The strike was suspended with a proposal from the settlement board after seven weeks of the strike.
Metalmen received a 16 percent raise.
The spring 1977 electricity strike lasted 49 days and caused power cuts across the country.
Breaking Thursday, 1993
On November 4, 1993, some 20,000 people gathered in front of the Parliamentary House, many of whom have been made unemployed by the recession, to protest in favour of the work.
Firefighters striked for three months in 1998
The firemen's strike was one of the longest, if not longest, national strike in the 1990s.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were caught in egg rain when farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
"Siperia teaches, the EU stops," one of the slogans was one.
For Espa, farmers dumped tons of snow.
The Helsinki EU summit in 1999 also caused farmers to protest and burn bales in front of the meeting place.
Nurses striked in 1983 and 1995
Nurses were on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been on strike was 1983.
The strike in 1995 was colored by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened strike and nurses' collective resignations in 2007.
The threat of mass resignation eventually speeded the negotiations to a conclusion.
Doctors Striked 2001
"Doctors on strike - forced to," was the slogan of doctors on strike in 2001.
The strike by municipal health centre and hospital doctors lasted about five months and sparked a lively discussion about how strikes could endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised doctors' wages.
Students on the move in 2013
About 5,000 students marched in favour of student support in Helsinki from Senate Square to Parliamentary House in 2013.
Central Crime Police investigates backgrounds of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police for help in investigating the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped a truck with 42 refugees near the German border in Aisterheim.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
Those on board the cold truck were all in good condition.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and the main responsibility lies at the scene in Austria, reports the Central Crime Police Chief Inspector Tero Haapala.
At the end of August, other refugees on board in Austria were more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board apparently died by suffocation.
According to Yleinenradio, who first reported cooperation with Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited company.
The company carries out restaurant activities, for example, and its CEO is a man of foreign background, about 40 years old.
In Austria, two Iraqi men have been arrested for smuggling human beings.
A captain beating refugees, a former drug courier and a rich businessman - the story of five smugglers
A loaded king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a stylistic missionary, and a taxi driver who thinks he's a good guy.
For example, these people are smuggling people into the European Union.
The criminologist Andrea Di Nicola, who works at Trento University, and the journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and the book Death Travel Agency, which they wrote, is published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the tentacles of human smuggling, propose solutions and present smugglers from different steps of the business.
HS presents five of them.
I'm going to beat the hell out of them right now.
Kerkenna Islands on the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians are heading there for the summer.
In terms of its location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, as the journey to the island of Lampedusa, which belongs to Italy, is only 120 kilometres away.
For comparison: distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometres.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, the chain-burning captain and the father of six children.
Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimps, but it is more profitable for a fisherman to transport people.
That's what Emir has already done with his blue, ten-metre wooden boat hundreds of times.
If the boat is full, it can accommodate 40 people.
For one trip, Emir earns about 8,000 euros after expenses.
Emir has five assistants who are looking for customers around Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis sparked again.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will accommodate them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is given in such a way that customers barely survive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer runs out of money, that's their problem.
We're going to take off at midnight and put out a lantern.
The first night is driven away from the islands, then stopped, wait for the day and drive the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and in waves 20 metres high, passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir is on his way back.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats his customers and at least claims to beat the troublemakers to death.
He says in the book that once the police caught him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed customers one by one from the neck and threw them overboard," Emir said in the book.
The calmest passengers come from the south side of the Sahara.
He said he had to abuse his countrymen from here.
I'm going to beat the hell out of them right now.
We need to show them who's in charge here immediately.
Just an ordinary taxi driver
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.
His taxi is not very good - the starter engine is running out and it has already seen its best days.
The most important thing for Goran's customers, however, is that the taxi moves at all, and that it moves towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 people about 60 kilometres southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where families are mainly allowed.
In the woods around the centre, men who travel without their family stay in tents, lavatorys and abandoned cars, which is what anyone has managed to find or build.
Families who, for one reason or another, have not filed an asylum application for Serbia also live in the forest.
Some also stay in private apartments, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of border crossings and weeks of walking in difficult terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When people finally arrive at the Bogovaða area, the great hub of human smuggling, they are dying tired.
Goran's riders are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The Syrians are the best customers, he says in the book.
"They say it once, and that's enough," Goran says.
He said the Africans are trying to bargain.
Goran won't like that.
Silly nonsense all the way.
For example, a price of 300 euros will be agreed first, then they will lower it to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran emphasises that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I don't care about the money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran says he's working cheaper than the others and charging only 50 euros per person for a ride to the Hungarian border.
The distance is about 300 kilometres, most of the motorway comfortably.
They say colleagues ask for a triple or quadruple price.
Goran earns about 50,000 euros a year.
It's not a big sum for a smuggler, but it's a pretty nice annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has decreed that taxis are not allowed to transport migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care about it: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his rider a mile from the border.
Then she points the right direction to her customers and screams away.
The Work of Mercy
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called a Missionary, and that's not just a nickname.
He does indeed have a Protestant church in Kampala, Uganda's capital, where there are many believers who have fled Congo, and a small centre to help Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Missionary runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He sees himself doing the work of mercy.
It is important for the missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and makes sure the rubber band of white underpants looks elegantly under the low waistline of jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his SUV and his three motorcycles.
When the Missionary does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and forwards to Europe.
The customer will first call one of the Missionary's five telephone numbers.
He advises that it is worth arriving at the border in the morning, hiding the money carefully, and slid in among the cross-border peddlers.
To get an asylum seeker or refugee status, Ugandan authorities should be told that they come from war areas such as North Kivu, and that they have had to flee from their home for violence.
Often it is true, but if it isn't, the Missionary organises a new identity for the customer.
The old ID will be destroyed and a replacement will be purchased.
The Missionary contacts with Ugandan police will help.
After that, the customer will be directed to the same place where even the right asylum seekers will go: asylum procedure, to NGOs, eventually to the UN refugee organisation UNHCR.
The missionary knows bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He charges for each step separately: leaving an application to Ugandan police costs about €100, handling documents to a humanitarian organisation about 150, and moving to a European country for example €4 500-7,000.
Folio and ice cubes
Tom is a rookie smuggler, a former drug courier.
An Irishman in his 40s is on duty on the French coast of Calais, where his job is to load people to lorries en route to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan, a French taxi driver living in London, and dozens of truck drivers who do not necessarily even know they are in the human smuggling business.
At night Tom and the taxi driver picked up their customers, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near Calais centre.
They're driving the A26 and they're trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the motorway, Tom and the driver would go straight to jail for organising illegal immigration.
Tom doesn't want that, he's been doing seven years for drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom and his customers run across the motorway to a rest stop where the drivers sleep before continuing across the Channel to the Brits.
Tom chooses a suitable truck - to make sure it is on its way to England and not to Holland, for example - and cuts through the safety cable of the cover.
It has to be done quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his customers in aluminium foil, the same kind that is wrapped around a roast or baked potato in the kitchen.
That should keep the police heat scanner from noticing who's hiding.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his customers in a truck and leaves, hoping the driver doesn't rush stowaways, at least not before Britain.
King of Smugglers
Muammer Kedk is one of the world's most famous human smugglers.
The up-and-coming Turk has been called the champion of marketing and the indisputable king of illegal Mediterranean landings, who controls the sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Since the 1990s, K.q. has been working and has been constantly developing new methods of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only demands the money when he gets there.
One of the new methods is a luxury ship scam: yachts from Turkish ports are supposed to be chartered to take American or European families to a nice tourist cruise for a few days.
In reality, the ships are being loaded to the full by Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are first transported from Istanbul to a port and then to Europe by sea for a fee of 5 000 to 7,000 euros.
Customers are kept in human storage, for example in old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People are crammed into minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among the vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it is given, you must board the ship quickly.
Passengers must stay hidden all the way under the deck.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, as there are no other signs of a crowd.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
After the cost of one luxury ship trip, K.q. will receive about 53,000 euros.
He doesn't do practical things himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, housekeepers and other smaller people to do the work for him.

American Olympic runner tells about his illness and becoming a prostitute in his book
The new book by 1,500 metres runner Suzy Favor Hamilton, which competed three times in the Olympics, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book Fast Girl, tells of his career ending and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated published sections of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton ended his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the games in top shape and ran in the qualifiers for the second best time.
But in the final, he panicked.
From the very beginning, he rushed to the top and defended his lead with a manic run.
However, 150 metres before the goal, his strength was exhausted.
He collapsed on the track, and the other rivals passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot and thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself over the finish line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
Later it was revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt tremendous pressure for success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of getting paid to have sex with strange men.
She also convinced her husband to accept her actions.
Favor Hamilton's rate was 450 euros an hour.
He says he spent the money on luxury life.
Favor Hamilton's explanation for becoming a prostitute was also that he needed the same kind of adrenaline spikes he had when competing in athletics.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he had bipolar disorder.
The former star runner's double life was revealed at the end of 2012, when the Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympics in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was 3,57,40, the world's top statistical number one at 1500 metres, but was the last in the Sydney Olympic final.
The world champion rejoiced when the union disciplined Norway's ski rooster: "Straightback"
The Norwegian ski king, Petter Northug, has crossed the limits of propriety in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian ski association have twisted the athlete's contract for the whole summer and autumn, like last year.
Even though the union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been enough for a multiple world champion and Olympic champion.
The Norwegian ski association decided to exclude Northug from the World Cup of the coming season.
The decision was praised by the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad the union controlled the ski rooster.
"Thank you for pointing to the spine," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the union sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian ski association and Northug is about money.
Northug apparently would like to be part of the season's national team so he can advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent the union, which also cares for future generations, and does not let one athlete play solo.
At the same time, he recalled that the union has given Northug both financial and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has quite different rules than just because he is the best.
On Tuesday, Northug published his own press release in which he said he wanted to play in Norwegian colours next season in the World Cup and then in the World Championships and Olympic Games.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six World Championship medals in her career, including two gold medals.
He was part of a team that won message gold in Falun last winter.
Roast translators' shield day is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On S.H.I.E.L.D. on September 25th, there will be stunts in various restaurants and shops that have been granted the Roast Translators' shield.
The goal of the day is to highlight Finland's high-quality food industry skills and lower the threshold for going to a restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of the high quality.
At the same time, we want to remind you that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the capital region, but top restaurants inspected and classified by an impartial operator are found all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of increasing the familiarity of the turtle restaurants and the organisation.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is organised in Vaasa in restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola, a restaurant in Old Town will take part in the shield day.
The event has also received significant international attention.
The decision has been made to make the event one of the most significant international events that will take place in the same day around the world.
Finland will continue to host the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: From the establishment of the Kauhava reception centre to the Attorney General
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to set up a refugee reception centre in Kauhava's ex-opportunity now owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, there is still a permanent crisis-time critical infrastructure in the area that is used by the armed forces and its partner, Suomen Erillisverkkot Oy.
Kauhajoki magazine reports that according to a private individual, investing a reception centre in the same building would pose a significant security risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the military may have interests in the area and the airport of the former Air War School, the effect of which has not also been clarified during the preparation of the reception centre, the newspaper writes.
The case states that there have been discussions over Kauhava airport over the last two years about the organisation of flight training and the arrival of a potential foreign operator at the airport.
The matter has been discussed, among other things, with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (P.D.) and Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Defence Arto Rädy.
A private person says to the Attorney General that the complaint is not a matter of objecting in principle to the reception centre, but that the planned place in the former garrison area is wrong.
Kauhava City Board discussed the reception centre issue last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The management means that the immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö commented to the reporters in the evening after meeting the chairmen of all the parliamentary parties at his official residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the president, the concern about managing the refugee situation brought all the participants together.
He considers it valuable that in Finland government and opposition parties are able to discuss the fundamental issues in confidence.
Especially in these times when we face major challenges
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and the actions of Russia and the United States in the region can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, as a result, the Baltic Sea region.
Niinistö is hopeful about the development of the dialogue.
If that situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia are able, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the further tension in the Baltic Sea situation.
According to Niinistö, the question of NATO was also addressed in discussions.
The president did not comment on the labour market situation.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, Alkot closed for a couple of hours
One flight will be cancelled already on Thursday and 15 Friday.
The list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair's website.
Finavia says that the operations at the airports will be carried out by the superiors during the stoppage.
However, congestion and delays are expected for security checks and other service points.
The demonstration closes the streets of central Helsinki
The demonstration will close the streets in central Helsinki on Friday.
Police say the streets leading to Railway Square will be closed from the cars around 9.30-14.
From Mannerheimintie direction, no cars are allowed to Kaivokatu, Postikatu or Töölönlahtinkatu towards the railway station.
From Union Street to Hakaniemi, traffic is directed to Union Street at Kaisaniemi's roundabout.
According to the police, the closing time depends on the population involved in the demonstration.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
Metro and tram drivers at the rally all Friday
Metro and tram drivers take part in Friday's demonstration from the beginning of morning traffic to the end of night traffic.
The association of tram and metro staff told the STT about the matter last night.
The majority of starters close for two hours, including mail closed
The demonstration on Friday will also cause disruption to Posti services.
Significant delays can be expected, for example, for the delivery of day mail.
Most of the postal service points are closed.
The blood transports of the Finnish Red Cross are carried out despite the strike.
Food transport and hospital deliveries and laboratory samples are also being taken care of.
Information about the services can be found on Posti's website.
Most of Finland's Alkko closes their doors for two hours on Friday.
Service trade union Pam has instructed her employees to stop work between 11 and 13.
Pam has also urged grocery trade employees to take part in the trade union demonstration.
SOK and Kesko's representatives will tell Helsingin Sanomat that the store will be kept open with superior powers if necessary.
According to Kesko, there is no information yet on the possible closure of individual shops.
Helsinki day care centres partially closed
The day care centres in Helsinki do not work to their full extent on Friday, says the Helsinki National Agency for Early Education.
Because of the trade union demonstration, day care is possibly concentrated in certain day care centres, and club activities in kindergartens and playgrounds are not organised.
24-hour day care centres and groups of mentally disabled and multi-disabled children remain open.
In addition, the afternoon activities of mentally disabled and autistic schoolchildren are organised normally.
The Early Education Agency promises to inform more about changes in operations tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, there is a need for diverse channels for communication, and the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches are one of the others.
This kind of direct speech channel will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä said to journalists in the parliament.
Sipilä didn't want to estimate how often the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches will be repeated.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be delivered on Yle channels in the future.
If other channels register as a channel, let's see.
Now we use this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires a television and radio speech to be given to citizens.
This whole thing we are talking about is quite complicated and requires a longer justification.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä explained.
The speech will be broadcast from 21.05 to 21.20 both on TV1 and Radio in Finland.
It can also be watched in Yle Areena.
Sipilä takes a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä's televised speech will not tell of a more general introvert of the government.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define a public debate more strictly into its own hands and to refuse a public discussion about the questions?
Reminds me of a recent statement by Minister of Foreign Affairs (Timo) Soin that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these things are not related.
Koivunen understands that commercial media is indignant about Sipilä's announcement.
It would be weird if the media field didn't react.
Political decision-makers' communication styles are not announcements in democracy.
The role of media representatives is, by definition, to try not to take politicians' agendas when given.
According to Koivusen, television speech is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table to meet the exceptionally high expectations of the speech.
Is there more of what we have already heard available today?
Or is he able to speak in a different tone, in a different way or in different words or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old, you have to wonder why such a big gesture was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
Yle also takes a risk in that sense, if it is not a special situation, but a routine speech among others.
There is a danger that Yle will be branded as a communicator of politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in Yle's interest or general policy.
Sipilä's clever move
In Sipilä's forthcoming speech, what the Prime Minister does not say is also important, the media researcher emphasises.
In the evening, we should take a close look at what Sipilä is missing and what it is not, says Heikki Kuutti, research coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to Kuutti, TV speech is a clever move from Sipilä, because it allows him to bring out his own vision without turning to gravel.
This way the message will be given a public audience without a journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
Sipilä bypasses the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a danger that the media will interpret something wrong from the speech, because it will not be possible to ask more specific questions.
According to the moon, it's very important how Sipilä performs on TV - whether the sweat is falling, the hands are shaking.
He compares Sipilä to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can put it well, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government were to inform something, because here a person is talking directly to another person.
This is what Obama and his partners do regularly (US President Barack).
Very exceptional
Political researcher Erkka Railo thinks the Prime Minister's speech to the citizens is truly exceptional.
According to him, it has not happened in decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, says Railo.
The researcher thinks the Prime Minister wants to make the Finns sympathise with the blackmails ahead.
On Friday, wage-earners' organisations will organise demonstrations and strikes against the government's actions.
Paavo Arhinmäki, president of the Left Alliance, said on Twitter that Sipilä could give a speech about the state of the nation in parliament as a Prime Minister's announcement, so that the speech could also be discussed.
SDP President Antti Rinne (Sd.) announces that he is challenging Sipilä's dialogue.
This is no time for monologues.
Soon six months after the election.
You can't hide forever, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on the run has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine when he was found.
The boy has been found and in the KING, the boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The Police Department of Inner Finland also confirms the matter to Iltalehti.
The boy went out to play around four o'clock in the afternoon.
Later in the evening, he was no longer in contact.
My father thanks all the people who helped in the search.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed in the violent fad of young people: You create anger
Makwan Amirkhani, a Kurdish fighter, released a video on Facebook, which specifically appeals to young people with an immigrant background.
Makwan Amirkhani gave a heavy speech against street fights among young people.
Amirkhani, who was born in Iran and arrived in Finland with his family at the age of five, has so far won both of his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series in the free match.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking him to look at an Instagram account.
Videos have been downloaded to the account, in which young people fight with extreme violence.
Amirkhani says he's disappointed in the young people's fad.
Amirkhan, 26 years old, has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys are kicking the people on the ground, sitting on top of the other person, and striking without thinking about any of these consequences, what will happen when you do these kinds of videos, Amirkhani updates.
Hard to defend anymore
Some of the young people seen in the videos have an immigrant background.
According to Chief Inspector Jarmo Heinonen of the Helsinki Police, both immigrants and young people from Finland have downloaded fight videos to social media.
It's the fact that you're fighting at the top of the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, Amirkhani from Turku reminds.
Amirkhani reminds that there are websites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
There have been a gross number of these isolated cases.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you any longer.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be guests here for quite a long time.
That's a slightly different way to thank you for being here, Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani encourages young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever fall victim to racism, you will blame yourself for it.
Think about it a couple of times before you go along with something like that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action is a contribution to racism.
You make me hate that I don't like either.
You're already having a bad time and you won't make it any better, Amirkhani decides.
SAK pledges its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
SAK president Lauri Lyly says on Twitter that the employee association will consider its position on the alternative savings list presented by STTK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK's proposal on Twitter.
Earlier Wednesday, STTK announced that it would present its own proposal to the government to achieve the five per cent productivity leap demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre).
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder believes the board will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require SAK, the largest employee organisation, to soften its previous position.
SAK president Lauri Lyly, for his part, commented on the matter in a narrowly worded way on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock", and that instead of forced laws, agreements are needed by active parties.
Lyly points out that Prime Minister Sipilä's government's proposal for a social contract was not acceptable to SAK.
Sipilä earlier interrupted negotiations on a social contract when SAK refused to commit to the goal of a five per cent productivity leap.
Comment: The grand demonstration threatens to simmer - "It feels a bit funny to put a fist on"
It's a bit funny to shake your fist if you already have a settlement paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The atmosphere varies from side to side in an employee camp.
Is it supposed to shout the government down, or is it supposed to agree with it?
On Monday, SAK's union leaders breathed holy hatred against the republic's government.
The whole of Finland was threatened with closing.
The threat spread to the Akavans as well.
The teachers' union OAJ threatened to close schools and nurseries.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: no school or kindergarten will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), chairman of the staff centre organisation STTK, performed conciliatoryly.
He said he had kept in touch with the government and prepared an alternative proposal called for by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre) as a five per cent productivity leap.
Akava's chairman, Sture Fjäder (kok) immediately rushed to announce that his settlement papers have already been completed.
At first, there was no sound from SAK's office.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is hard to agree when the union leaders just Monday told the country to stand up on Friday.
Finally, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau will meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK will look for solutions to "open the labour market lock."
In order to create a collective wage and salary earners' proposal, SAK should be inclined to accept a five per cent productivity leap as a goal.
It is no wonder that Palola's STTK has a good relationship with Sipilä's government.
Palola's right-hand man, Jukka Ilmaus, director of STTK's social engagement, previously served as a special assistant to the central prime ministers Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
In fact, Palola described the government's ay-know-how as being improved all the time.
It's a coincidence or not, but Palola's exit took a bit of a boost away from Finland's stoppers, whose vantage point is African Marko Pieinen (sd).
It's a bit funny to put a fist in your pocket if you already have a make-up paper in your pocket.
Edited at 6 pm: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
Russian Duma Speaker Sergei Naryshkin criticised the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
Russian Duma Speaker Sergei Naryshkin thinks Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
A autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun in Ulan Bator, Mongolia's capital, where Naryshkin made extensive comments about the Helsinki formal meeting in July.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who were coerced by the European Union, to attend a meeting - a matter the President was able to remind journalists of.
According to our estimates, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed according to the news agency Interfax.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU but also at the United States, where he had also been blocked.
Sanctions are a political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation was uncomplicated, so Naryshkin continued to pry Finland with praise and praise for Mongolia's "excellent organisation."
I am sure that the parliamentary assembly will be constructive and with positive results - unlike the meeting that took place in Helsinki in July.
Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue should not be hindered.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (cok) who, according to Russian media, has already talked to the Russian delegation in Ula Bator.
The Clave meets the real playoff troll: "The paints are tight"
Tappara and Lukko will continue in Hakametsä today as both are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that today there will be no actual goal party in Hakametsä.
Tappara went to Kuopio yesterday to drill a 3-2 spin from KalPa.
The rise was manly, as last season's silver team was worst of a two-goal losing position.
The lock's Tuesday was a lot better.
The Blues, who started the Rauman catch with a tangled start, had round zero points, and the loss figures were also 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if any play the same game as last year, Luku attacker Janne Lahti anticipates layouts on the club's website.
Tappara has become quite a playoff nightmare for the people of Rauma.
Tappara has dropped the final series of the Luko in the semifinals in the previous two seasons.
Both times a decisive seventh match has been required for the solution.
Last season, Lukko took the series to a break already in the fourth game, but Tappara rose in the next three by the side and past.
With the exception of goalies, there are no major changes in group formations.
The cashiers who rejected both of them yesterday will have a flute today.
With Tapara's goal, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Bear, and Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski between the Lukko poles.
Viewpoint: A miserable play is going on in Ässä
The sports director Toivola wrote an unsuitable sequel to the head coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote Rocky, in which he himself played the lead.
The underdog sensationally struggled with the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a lot of sympathy, even though he finally lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's premiere, Mika Toivola wrote a restless Cinderella story in Pori.
Unnamed and wooden-handed casserole went to everyone's amazement at the SM finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but persistent underdogs like Rocky.
There were White Indians, Pori Matt and Pele Pelto.
In the playoffs, the players dyed their heads red and cut the Irokees.
Toivola became blonde.
Great TV commentator JP Jalo called the coach Neumann.
Aces took the won silver.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
The screenwriter Toivola believes that this season's new work will work in the same way as it did ten years ago.
The man who works as a sports director for the Ässä has built a casserole on bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been pounding the guys in the rink like Rocky pig carcasses at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen's merits lie in something other than playing in the disc.
Toivola has forgotten that Pekka Rautakallio plays the main part in Rocky VI.
Karri Kivi has crucified Rautakallio with Sean Connery.
Rautakallio is as clumsy a lead performer as Connery would have been in the original 1976 work in Toivola's script.
There's nothing else in Iron Rock but a nickname.
Rautakallio's game philosophy does not include rushing and little pigs.
He appreciates the tough game, but it's one thing to play hard than a pig.
Last season, Ässien Garret Stafford hit Tapara Jere Karjalainen on the head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Rautakallio put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only have those who deserve to play.
I don't approve of that kind of game and it's not part of the ace hockey, the hot Rautakallio squealed to the Satakunta People after the game.
The Ässien team for this season is strangely built.
There are juniors, veterans, police officers and bulldozers.
There are practically no key men of the best age.
No wonder the head coach has complained of a skill shortage.
How much have you been able to influence player acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
Last season's events have an impact on procurement and, unfortunately, the situation on the market was rather limited, Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
It's smouldering under the surface.
The 1953 model, Rautakallio, is known to be interested in moving to Toivola as a sports boss.
The men's contracts end in the spring.
The Ässit balance in the three league games of the season is as many losses with goal difference 1-6.
Toivola should not have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuukka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under her husband's direction.
Yes, in the film I play the mother of my husband's friend.
In a way it feels crazy, the actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
She has been married to Apulanta's ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temonen since 2008.
The couple has done a lot of work together before, but now Olga is acting under Tuukka's direction for the first time.
Olga's role in Apulanta's film "You Made Us Beautiful" is drummer Sipe Santapuk's mother Sirkka.
Sirkka tsempa and supports his son, even though his father Risto (presented by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I have become familiar with my true role model, Sirka, the easier it seems to be to play the role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuukka for trusting me with the role.
Olga had already met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have come much closer.
They've met, talked on the phone, and they've been texting.
Sirkka has helped so much.
We've been going through a lot of their history from different angles.
Sirkka is also fortunate to understand that drama is drama and the truth may need to be slightly coloured.
Olga emphasises that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanta would be Finland's biggest band.
In the '90s, there was a recession and it was really sad.
There was a rather small probability that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga says she had heard a lot about Tuukka's youth already before the film plans.
However, parents' stories have sometimes been slightly different.
Yes, if you are a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were doing.
Olga reveals that her youth was completely different from Tuukka's, known as Heinola's notorious skateboard story.
Olga was an everyday girl who had nothing to do with Tuukka in the film.
At most, he could have secretly fallen in love.
According to Olga, he has cooperated so much with Tuukka in the past 10 years that a big joint project does not scare him.
Everything has always gone super well.
Now the whole production group is going to shoot in Heinola for a month.
True, a couple living in Iitt are often planning to drive home for the sake of their young children, because the distance is not too long.
We're taking over the whole Heinola for a month.
They have welcomed us very warmly, just asking which streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive play in Finland
The budget for the film Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, is 17 million euros.
The shoot will begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola begins filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
The sequel of the Scifi film Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will be the most expensive drama ever made in Finland with a budget of 17 million euros.
Previously, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been on Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation that is under construction will also rise after completion of Iron Sky 2, with a budget of over 100 million euros.
The film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa, begins in October near Antwerp in AED Studios and lasts eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola leaves for Belgium already next week.
The giant budget doesn't scare me.
I've been so relaxed!
I feel so relaxed about the script, because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone in the task force seems to realise that something unprecedented is being done.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though the time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, she tells Iltalehti.
Originally, the budget for the film was set at 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
It's a big budget, but it's a big story, too.
But you could shove 100 million into the film, because every angle and effect is so expensive.
Now everything is so tight that there is no looseness.
The film production company Iron Sky Universe launched a crowdfunding campaign and a bond with an annual rate of between 4 and 8 per cent on Wednesday.
The final interest rate will be determined according to the demand and supply during the campaign.
In two years at the latest, the company will repay the loan.
The action film is played by Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov, among others.
Junk or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Lately, the fronts of the Trendsetters have been decorated with big logos.
A while ago, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
The advertising of a hoodie or a T-shirt sign was seen as a bit of a hick.
But times change.
Sporting has become the real megatrend of fashion, and so have old, familiar sport fashion brands like Adidas and Nike.
And as so often before, the line between funny and trendy is fluctuating: if something is already a real hillbilly, it begins to become ironic and cool.
First came a norm core trend, or mundane fashion, in which the trendsetters surprised by preferring the most boring basic clothes as a way to separate themselves from the mass.
Now, instead of the grey standard college, the sweat shirt that is already buried at the bottom of the cabinet, with the manufacturer's logo showing up in front of it, will be turned on.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, for example Adidas' recognizable stripes, favorite team jerseys and New York Yankees hats have made a return to street fashion.
The Calvin Klein logos of the underwear are now a cool detail from the beginning of the jeans edge.
The trend seems to be moving from sport brands to luxury brands.
For example, the front of Versace's autumn blouses makes it clear what the clothing is.
Would you be ready to display logos in your dress?
Russian politician released evidence: I didn't get stuck in the tank hatch for hours!
According to claims, a special incident would have happened in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015 was held to present Russian war industry products.
There have been colorful claims in the Russian media in recent days that the Russian emergency department had to remove Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything in his power to deny the information.
He even posted a picture on his own public Facebook page, where he seems to be peeking at the armored vehicle hatch in quite good moods and, at least, based on those photos, it's not a matter of getting stuck or angry.
It's a bunch of nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go inside the battle tank, but it was the assault tank BMP-3.
I am a former soldier myself, Lieutenant Colonel, I have served in the Urals.
I went inside, looked around, and came out in peace, Zotov said to Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I didn't get stuck and I certainly didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
Zotov explained that he admired Russia's new technology in the exhibition because he is a former professional soldier himself.
That's why I was interested in what was inside the carriage, I admired our technology.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And even in the next exhibition, I will definitely visit all the tanks and all the assault tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the reporter who wrote about it a fool.
One idiot wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went in, and I came out.
I'm tall, I'm slobbery, but nothing like me stuck in a tank somewhere, didn't happen, he said to Russkaya sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photograph of the alleged stuck has been published, even though the gun show had a total of 50,000 people in a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck began with a case on Bloknot.ru, where Zotov was told to struggle out of the tank door to try and finally threaten to shoot everyone around him if he did not get out of his grip.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up article in which the exhibition organisers shared their views on the event.
Everyone is just used to soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles quickly.
But MP Zotov, because of his big size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he certainly didn't sit there for five hours, said exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevsky to Bloknot.

There has been a leak in the Kittilän mine of Agnico Eagle Finland, a Canadian-owned mining company.
The gold mine's purified process water has been leaking from the so-called tailing pool into a ditch.
According to the company, measures to repair the leak have been initiated.
The pool has desiccated tailings and purified process water from the foaming process.
Usually the water is pumped either to be re-used as process water or to be delivered to the environment via the surface draining field according to the permit.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was observed.
According to the company, the quality of leak water meets the current permit conditions.
There was no other material leaking into the environment.
The leak was observed during the inspection round on Monday morning.
The leak has not been found to cause structural damage to the dam structures in the pool.
The company says it is working closely with authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent employees.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish country report published today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) largely follows the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation pushed Finland into comprehensive structural reforms to deal with economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the whole contract system and unemployment benefit.
According to Danske Bank's chief economist Pasi Kuoppamäki, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
The IMF's assessment contains a lot of sympathetic messages for government actions, but on the other hand there are also warning words about what shouldn't be cut too much.
These include infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki says to Taloussanom.
In the IMF's view, growth projects should also be implemented as quickly as possible to support weak economic growth.
The IMF anticipates an economic growth rate of 0.4 per cent for Finland this year, which will accelerate to 0.9 per cent next year.
Danske, in his new business forecast today, expects the growth to be zero this year.
The IMF is a bit more optimistic about this year.
They may have had the basis for the latest observations.
This morning, Statistics Finland said that total output was growing slightly in the summer, Kuoppamäki says.
Less attention could be paid to the weakened industry's trust or other so-called softer indicators.
However, the differences are only a few percentage points.
Nintendo, who recovers from death, appointed a new leader
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will start working on Wednesday, Nintendo said on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002, and he was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for launching a successful Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as Iwata's potential followers.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata's footprints, estimates Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
Kimishima's task is to get Nintendo into mobile games, but not to eat the company's bread on the side of traditional consoles.
More and more underage asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
Already in February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service acknowledged that hundreds of children who have come to the country disappear every year.
For example, SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter have reported this on their website, according to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of minor applicants disappear every year in the country.
Senior Inspector-General of the Finnish Immigration Service Juha Kannelmaa says what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is it the same in Finland?
How many applicants disappear "under country" per year?- A total of 156 asylum applications were made in Finland in 2013.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014, similar applications were made in 196 and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelmaa says.
The reason for the disappearance may be that the case will reveal that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and has possibly been found to be of age there.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue to process the case in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for examining the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 were closed because the applicant had probably moved away from Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared in the last 123 years, he says.
Is the number increasing?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum for a minor who has been alone.
The overall statistics on minor asylum seekers who have disappeared this year are not yet available, but the number of underage applicants is known and has clearly increased, which is also likely to affect the number of missing persons, he emphasises.
What will happen to those who have decided to convert?
Do they also disappear, for example, into the "dark labour market"?
This is difficult to estimate from the Finnish Immigration Service, because the police are responsible for implementing the conversion decisions, Kannelmaa emphasises.
Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered candidates.
He has taken action on the matter.
At the EU Home Secretary's meeting, Orpo, who discussed refugee issues, said on Monday about practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see pictures of the equipment
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkose, a pioneer in the media industry who lost his ability to work because of the attacks is now on sale.
Mikkonen's spouse Nina Mikkonen sells equipment at Huuto.net, which was once one of the most advanced professional equipment in her field.
The online ad was the first to tell online newspaper Iltamakasini.
Today, a large part of the equipment has been left behind by technological progress.
In the digital media world, television shows are no longer on Betacam tapes.
However, Nina Mikkonen is confident that there are interested people.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date in that way, but these too will be needed as long as there is old-generation material that needs to be digitised.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of enthusiasts - collectors and studio builders, Nina Mikkonen ponders for IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset is trying to move away from his current home in Stormlän.
There's no way we can take all the stuff with us.
I have gradually begun to inventory and see what goods are being abandoned.
This is where I started, says Nina Mikkonen.
There is no use for TV and radio equipment of its own anymore.
After recent strokes, it is clear that the man who made a long career will not return to working life.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen's actual life's work was archived already in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up boxes of films and other material from Myrmalä.
Traffic threatens to porridge worse than expected: Metro and trams can stop for the whole Friday
Metro and tram drivers decide today whether they will expand the force in connection with Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram traffic only during the demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon, it will be decided whether the traffic will stop for the whole day.
Pekka Hirvonen, head of trust, says that he is big on the field.
The cuts in night and shift supplements hurt the drivers badly, so the government's plans to cut the sheets cause opposition.
Hirvonen thinks that stopping traffic all day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and tram stop on Friday, public transport in the Greater Helsinki area will be virtually completely stagnant.
According to VR data, trains do not run between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Friday.
On Friday there will be no commuter or long-distance traffic.
The trains that left before 6 a.m. will be driven to the stations of destination.
According to HSL's information, most of the buses stay in the depot.
ACP members will be absent from work on Friday from 3 a.m. to 3 a.m. Saturday morning at 3 a.m.
Most likely a small number of buses can be driven, they are driven by superiors, according to HSL's spokesman Pirkko Repo.
Repo says that HSL cannot tell exactly which bus services will take place on Friday.
Wage-earner organisations organise a grand demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Square on Friday from 11 am to 1 pm.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place on the Hungarian-Serbia border, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, reports the news agency AP.
According to Sky News, refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, Hungarian police would also have used water cannons against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at a school in Texas - the teacher thought a self-made clock was a bomb
In Texas, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after the teacher considered his own-made watch to be a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he only wanted to present the output of his electronics hobby.
But one of the teachers thought the clock looked like a bomb.
The police were called, and the situation ended with the boy being handcuffed to a juvenile detention cell.
Mohamed has never been found to have claimed anything more than that he had made a clock.
Still, it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a fake bomb.
Mohamed said the police had found the watch looked like a "movie bomb."
The clock is in police custody, but it was reportedly composed of a circuit board and a digital display with wires in between.
The incident happened last Monday and Mohamed was punished for three days of compulsory school leave.
His father is furious about the incident and the American-Islamic Council is wondering whether the incident is yet another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain's buzzing - Labour leader refused to sing the national anthem
In the song, God is asked to protect the Queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism of the right-wing press has also been shared by Corbyn's own Labour MPs.
This has offended the people, suspected Labour MP Kate Green in a BBC radio interview.
Green said Corbyn should have joined the song.
Last night's memorial service respected the battle of British air force pilots against German Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corbyn in an official statement and emphasises that he has shown respect to the pilots by participating in the event.
We all owe a huge debt of gratitude to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood with respect in silence during the national anthem, the statement stressed.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided Labour's ranks.
Especially among the MPs, there are those who fear he will banish moderate voters with radical views.
Corbyn is in favour of unilateral disarmament, ending austerity measures and increasing public spending.
For the first time today, Corbyn is to be a party leader in Parliament at Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what to ask Prime Minister David Cameron.
At the turn of the week, Cameron wrote on Twitter about Corbyn's election as party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, economic security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister tweeted with his own account.
The reason for the Minnesota family killing is still unclear - the family's father was facing a lawsuit
The South Lake Mintonka police have been investigating the family killing in Greenwood, Minnesota, for almost a week.
A family of five was found dead in their home on September 10 and a couple of days later the police confirmed that the shooter was their father Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife and three children with a shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead already for days
The family was found after the school had been concerned about the absence of children.
Based on this announcement, the police went to the house for an inspection and found Short's family dead across a huge house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A million-dollar house and a successful company
The investigation of the South Lake Mintonka police chief Michael Siitar is still ongoing.
The motive for the blood work is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and had created his fortune on the social media website AllNurses.com for nurses.
In 2014, in an interview with StarTribune, Short said there were four million different visitors to the site every week.
I have received 50 buy-in offers for the company in the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
Among other things, the success was reflected in the fact that the Short family bought a huge house in Greenwood in 2011 for $2 million.
The house is advertised as a car collector's dream at a real estate site in Zillow: there are not only 12 rooms in the house, but also enough garage for eight cars.
Court case pending
According to StarTribune, however, the family's father was facing a lawsuit.
Achieve Test Prep, who offered various prep courses, had sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, Short's website had not removed any defamatory comments about prep courses, and thus they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a significant impact on Short's business.
Vesku Loiri offered the cake coffee
In addition, the owner trio was awarded at the race event with the Finnish Hippos month's horse owner prize.
This is great, Loiri said in a good mood about his board of honour.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100,000 euros.
Artist legend Loiri was still confused about Fabrice Duo's success in the grand competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
According to Loiri, the coach of the success horse, Korpi, will have a full working peace while working with the horse.
Pekka orders and decides where the horse is going to compete.
And I'm keeping my mouth shut, Loiri blabbergasted.
An amazing gesture from an NHL star - "The greatest donation ever made by an athlete"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P.K. Subban has donated 10 million dollars (about 6.7 million euros) to Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the hospital's announcement, this is the biggest single donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban has committed to helping the hospital with other fundraising for the next seven years.
A year ago, Subban signed a contract with the Canadiens worth eight years and $72 million.
Subban's donation is thus significantly higher than his $9 million annual earnings.
As a reward for his donation, Subban will receive a lobby space bearing its name from the hospital.
Canadiens players have done much to help local hospitals in the past.
Long-term captain Jean Beliveau, who died a year ago, raised millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, and Saku Koivu raised a huge sum of money for another city's major hospital to get the PET scanner needed for cancer studies.
You can order a wife from a Japanese cafe for the evening - served only bikinis and aprons
Theme cafes are a big deal in Japan.
There is already a goat cafe, a rabbit cafe, a vampire cafe, a hug cafe and now a wife cafe.
It strikes the lonely, the sore and hungry.
Metro reported on the matter.
You can order a wife or husband for the evening at the Tokyo-based Ore no Yome cafe.
It is a waiter who pretends to be the client's spouse.
"Half" is selected from the list before coming to the cafe, and he prepares and serves the food.
The wife is facing just an apron and bikini with her husband wearing tight bicycle shorts.
The website provides all the information about the length and weight of the wife candidates to the type of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network: Car security attacks began to be armed
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the field, says Intel's release.
The board consists of top security experts from around the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections to standardise best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time Intel released the first version of best cybersecurity practices.
The company will update the report on the basis of the ASRB's research results.
The international ICT research and consulting company Gartner estimates that by 2020 about 150 million vehicles in traffic will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share web-based data.
We can and must improve cybersecurity in cars, says Chris Young, director of Intel Security.
With the help of ASRB, Intel can establish safety-related best practices and support the view that cybersecurity is a significant ingredient in the design of every car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in data processing.
Ford Focus RS costs about 52,000 euros in Finland!
Ford's Focus RS model has been expected for years like the moon rising.
At last, the car is also in sight in Finland.
Ford released RS's information now that the eyes of the car world are in Frankfurt's car show.
Ford's new four-wheeled RS accelerates from zero to 100 in 4.7 seconds with a 2.3-litre, 350-horsepower engine, with a peak speed of 266 kilometres per hour.
In Finland, the price is also interesting, it is said to be 52,000 euros.
The car is already available to order, though when the first cars will arrive in Finland, Ford does not say in his statement.
The favourite brand Kia introduced two new things at the Frankfurt car show - the new Sportage and Optima
The new fourth-generation Sportage, which Kia plans to catch a larger slice of the ever-growing SUV market, is certainly more important from two new things in Finland.
Sportage, created by Gregory Guillaume, the new European design director, is rounder than before.
A cent has come in between the axles and outside dimensions here and there, and the car splits the air even more efficiently.
The engine range is essentially unchanged, but a 1.6-litre turbo with 177 horsepower has been added to it.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported closer to being sold.
There is still a bit to wait for, because we will have a new Sportage in spring 2016.
Even before the change of year, new Kia Optimat reached our country.
Suddenly, the novelty does not seem to have changed, but it is a completely new car.
Kia plans to conquer the hearts of upper middle class buyers with better driving qualities, lower noise levels and higher quality equipment.
At the beginning, we get Optimos with 1.7-litre turbodiesel and 2.0-litre petrol engines.
Next summer, Optima GT, with a 2.0-litre turbo engine, will accelerate.
About the same time as its arrival, the sale of Optima Farmer begins.
Chisu went back to the stage, ranting in a bold jumpsuit.
Singer Chisu is at the Life for Child concert with other Finnish stars.
There's a spectacular, open neckline in an electric-blue pants suit.
The costume beautifully presents the shrivelling waist of the singer star.
The whole is crowned with a golden metal belt and red lipstick.
During a three-year break, a singer who has become a mother has been able to lose weight with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to turn one year old.
The singer released her first single from a new album in August.
I'm not really nervous about going back to the stage and getting in front of the public after a long break.
I've missed all the music-related things, the singer says.
In a couple of weeks, Chisu will release her new and also fourth album, called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired the making of new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu thinks.
Kim Kardashian's maternity style amazes me again - now you see the breast
The true beauty Kim Kardashian gives talks one after another.
She readily presents her pregnant stomach and chest equipment in sexy clothes, last night at 1 American time when she and her sister Kourtney Kardashian left husband Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent at the breast.
As the lightning lights flash, it reveals the color of the bra under the dress.
The last time Kardashian wore an Amazonic maternity dress was when he visited a friend at a dinner party in New York just a couple of days ago.
Black upper knee boots highlighted the outfit.
The third special maternity outfit is as fresh as last week's Friday, when there was a pregnant stomach on the show.
The hard laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, the competition is terrible
The top model Manon Leloup wanted to correct the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary "Speaking Dolls" in which Leloup and his colleagues speak out about model business.
Harpeer's Bazaar compiled Leloup's six hard truths from behind the scenes.
Every season begins from scratch.
Even if in the previous season you were posing in top designer outfits, the new season will begin again with Castings.
And every season there will be new, fresh faces in the industry that will compete for work with the bad guys.
Models rarely have places to call home.
The work is continuous travel, and it can take even a year to stay in a hotel room or an apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearable.
New York and Paris are the jobs they want, but they are the most stressful.
There is not just one kind of skinnyness.
An agent in New York may ask to drop kilos, but in Paris they say you're too skinny.
Getting a job is always a risky game.
In fashion weeks, models and designers are always together, and at the same time act as a support network.
When fashion weeks are over, the difference is sad.
Models want this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they are devoured by the fact that everyone thinks the job is just a showdown of clothes.
Models want to be their own personalities, too.
The work makes the models feel that they are actors with a role.
But you can also express yourself in the model's work.
Models yesterday at Tory Burch's show.
New York is currently celebrating fashion weeks, where designers reveal their next year's collection.
Roope Salminen, who changed his style, plays the most unknown Apulanta musician in the film
Roope Salminen performs Antti Lautala, the founding member of the band, in a film based on Apulanta's early years.
Lautala founded Apulanta in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but resigned from the band in 1994.
It's a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this film I'm playing a 16-year-old guitar player, Salminen laughs.
I haven't wanted to meet the real Antti before the shoot, because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown to people in that group, so I think it's good that I learn his play style only from video.
I don't want to make an impression about a person.
A completely empty man who runs the Roope Salminen and the Dogs band will not go into the role.
The Punk-managers come naturally to the man.
In the punk episode of stars, stars, I'm sure many people saw a foretaste, the same if they've ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been anything petty, but we always go to the fullest.
Tuukka Temonen, who played the bass in Apulana in 1993-2004, directed by Teitä, was announced today.
The core group that became familiar to the band's audience is presented to the general public by young actors who are still quite unknown.
The drummer Sipe Santapukki will be played by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtasta Tatu Sinissalo bassist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a hint about his future job last night, when he mysteriously told Snapchat he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Roope has already published a picture of his new look in Instagram yesterday, which he has had to carry out for the film.
Scrooge, previously seen in a mustache and chin beard, has shaved his face into smooth cheeks and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: How to tell children about refugees
Many parents have had to think in recent days about how to tell the child about the situation of refugees seeking to enter Europe.
Or is it worth telling?
There is no need to raise the issue by force, SPR crisis group member, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
Smaller children should be protected, for example, not allowed to watch the news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay in their minds and distress, he says.
However, if a child has come across television news pictures of refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth mentioning.
It is good to have a conversation about the child's starting point and to listen carefully to what he is asking.
The child's fears may be surprising.
They are not necessarily the ones the parent thinks he is afraid of.
You don't want to scare a child for nothing, even if you're anxious and scared.
A smaller child closely follows the behaviour of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child also feels safe.
The bigger children are likely to come across a discussion about refugees in school, with friends or online.
It is good for parents to raise the matter with them, if the child is wondering about it.
The fact is that not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents, together with children, can think about how to deal with this in our family.
In the end, though, do we think the world is a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.

It's hard to control the Pallosalamaa that hits Vermo
Perttu Pohjola was able to fine-tune Apilan Pallosalama in midsummer.
It was just going to win and take second place until the end of July in Tampere raves came to a collapse.
Since the stallion was completely clotted, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered an appointment with the vet for his protégé.
The explanation for the shutdown was found in the lookout.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not the mildest in the head, but it took two drops of medicine to overcome it.
Since Apilan Pallosalama had to be in light exercise, Pohjola says he is positively surprised by the last race of the horse.
It was in Turku in its record time the second SE-tamma after Taruntuuli.
Apilan Pallosalama was under a lot of pressure from the break, as it had only been able to drive normally for a few weeks.
Taking those things into account, a slight deflection at the end was understandable, says Pohjola.
The coach assumes that a proper competition was good for the stallion.
The horse's spirit certainly went on from there, and hopefully it would also have stabilised.
Apilan Pallosalama has been so-called humorous horses.
When it hasn't been in the mood, it could have turned fat without getting sick.
Instead, on a good day, the stallion has been released from such a bolt of lightning that the opponents have been amazed.
In short-speed, rivals are not able to compete with Pallosalama, who even loses warm-blooded rides.
In Vermo, there is a race in the hopes of the North.
But the difference is how Apilan Pallosalama will agree to it.
It's pretty hard at the time of departure, and it might stick under the boom of the starting car and all that.
I hope the stallion is calmer already than when Turku leaves.
Apilan Pallosalama can also come from the bow when he is well, and we're going to use it to win, coach promises.
This is why you can't get rid of useless iPhone programs
Tim Cook, CEO of Apple.
At least some of the software that comes with Apple iPhone phones may be removed sometime in the future - but not all.
Apple will possibly remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, says CEO Tim Cook in an interview with Buzzfeed.
Apple's iPhone has a set of programs that relatively few people use: for example FaceTime calls, Lehtikioski, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which came as a mandatory upgrade to iPhone phones, even though it is only necessary for Apple's smart watch owners.
According to Cook, removing Apple's software is more complicated than it looks.
Some apps are linked to someone else on iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems elsewhere on the phone," Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple iPhone apps work closely with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user delete them, Cook added.
So, according to Cook, Apple is investigating, as the company does not want to waste memory space on users' iPhone phones.
Euro area inflation dropped to 0.1 per cent in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only marginally in August, or 0.1 per cent from one year ago, said Eurostat, the EU statistical authority.
The rise in prices was pushed down by lower energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised its estimate of 0.2 per cent from a couple of weeks ago slightly downwards.
In July, inflation was 0.2 per cent.
So-called bottom inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat estimated base inflation at 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2 per cent cheaper last month than one year ago.
The average inflation in the whole EU of 28 countries was zero in August.
In July, the rise was 0.1 per cent.
Consumer prices rose most, or 1.4 per cent, in Malta in August.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest, with prices falling by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent minus the EU's harmonised price index.
Inflation in the euro area remains persistently distant from the European Central Bank's (ECB) target of a 2% increase in prices in the medium term.
The ECB predicts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
Next year the rise will pick up to 1.1 per cent, the Fed anticipates in its new inflation forecasts announced in early September.
U.S. Fed is next trying to tighten monetary policy
The next recession in the United States will begin at its fastest in less than a year, but more confident within three years, after Fed, the country's central bank, will start to raise its interest rates again for a long time.
And in the financial markets, the decline begins before the next recession.
Fed has hinted that it might start raising interest rates already this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
So the next recession can hit you at its fastest by next autumn and as a financial market rate rhythm before that.
Or at least that is what will happen if the world's largest economy and financial markets work as they have done - and if they react to Fed's financial blackmail as they have done before.
These are the conclusions of German bank Deutsche Bank's London market research strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed a 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to its international major customers last week.
The strategists who produced the study and the report do not pretend to know exactly when Fed will start raising its interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market after that.
Instead, they use the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics to show how the economy and the market have previously behaved during and after Fed's interest rates.
In addition to historical observations, they will examine which key variables in the economy and financial markets are now on the same or different model as in previous interest rates - and what might result from that.
It becomes clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now more flimsy to withstand the rise in interest rates than ever before since the 1950s.
Not even a year to start a recession
The leaders who decide on Fed's monetary policy and its current stance have hinted over the summer and early autumn that the time is getting ripe for interest rates.
The first rate increase in more than nine years can start already this week.
The matter will be resolved during Wednesday and Thursday, when the so-called open market committee of Fed's board meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
The last time Fed raised its so-called Fed funds steering rate in June 2006.
That was exactly the end of a two-year series of relatively regular but small interest rates of 0.25 percentage points, with Fed increasing its interest rate from 1.25 percent to 5.25%.
The symptoms of the financial markets began in 2007 with the difficulties of the US's most risky housing funding, and a year later the financial crisis ruptured into a global doomsday nightmare.
The great recession came in 2009.
Last time, serious setbacks in financial markets and the real economy began slower than has typically been the case since previous Fed interest rates.
Similarly, the trials were tougher and harsher than ever since the recession of the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategists have screened the rise and fall of the world's largest economies, as well as the turn of financial markets since 1950 and in some places since the beginning of the 19th century.
Fed's interest rates and their economic and financial impacts will be reported from the 1950s onwards.
Less than a year, mostly less than three years, and an average of less than three and a half years, has passed from the first rate increase to the beginning of the recession.
The rate increase in the financial markets has ended within two years of the start of Fed interest rates.
Fed has, in turn, increased its steering rate by a dozen cycles since the beginning of the 1950s.
Each time has differed from some others, and there are relatively few times in the review, so there is hardly any certainty about the effects of the subsequent interest rates.
The strategies remind us that this time a lot of things are different.
And not just better.
Interests too low for too long
The crucial causes of the financial crisis, let alone the culprits, are not necessarily found beyond doubt even by decades of research.
But for the reasons that led to the crisis and that have increased its destructive power, there are three things that are somewhat beyond doubt clear:
1) In the 2000s, Fed, the euro area ECB and other world's largest central banks considered their key interest rates too low for too long.
They were patching up the tracks of the techno bubble, and they also raised the next one.
2) Over the decades, the amount of debt accumulated and already excessive in the various parts of the financial and real economy grew even greater as a result of the overly lax monetary policy of central banks.
The biggest debt bubble in economic history until then was created.
3) In particular, the crazier debt financing, almost unpredictably packed into the financial economy, swelled the biggest exchange bubbles from shares to real estate, bonds and commodities in most parts of the financial markets up to that point in economic history.
There is hardly a great deal of controversy about the fact that the financial markets that had risen to a height on increasingly complex debt bonds were in a particularly dangerous and unstable state of affairs, as Fed and other central banks last drove up rates.
The financial structures set up on leverage, let alone the valuation bubbles, did not last more than a while after the rate hikes had begun and the cost of debt financing had turned up.
The risks were realised as a financial crisis followed by a major recession.
A bigger bubble and more debt
Deutsche's strategists don't guess what's next, but give a reason to think by mentioning, for example:
1) Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy stance even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower.
2) For a long time, the indebtedness has not been crazier than it was ten years ago, but now the debt money is literally cheaper than free.
So the debt burden in the financial and real economy has not lightened, but now there is a much heavier debt load in different parts of the economy than before or to the financial crisis.
3) The liquidity that has been released from central banks more rapidly and cheaper than before has largely remained in the financial markets and has cost the most important types of securities and assets, whether at the peak of the financial crisis or ever.
And not only do the strategists laxise the mood with financial market warning signals, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and from the worst recession in decades to the way it has been before.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is unusually weak, but correspondingly, the pressures and risks of the financial markets are far greater than before the financial crisis, when Fed next starts tightening its money taps tighter.
Perhaps the future of Albert Edwards, a strategist of the French bank Societe Generale, is not as strange as it suddenly seems.
He has been preparing the bank's international investor customers for Fed's next turnarounds for a good time:
First, Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst - and soon it will be time for Fed to run to put out the financial fires with even bigger QE money syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a computer and printer manufacturer, plans to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the deductions are directed to HP's business service side, says the company.
HP is divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which focuses on corporate sales in November, and HP Inc., which focuses on Pc machines and printers for consumers.
HP's personnel peaked in 2011 when it had 350,000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302,000.
The company records one-off costs of $2.7 billion (about €2.4 billion) in the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will cut 25,000 to 30,000 employees.
The reductions on the consumer side will remain at 3,300 within three years.
HP plans to relocate its operations to low-cost countries so that 60% of its employees would be in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers are responsible for more than 10% of its operating result.
In the year before last, its three most significant customers brought 65 per cent of the operating result.
iOS 9: How to get a new operating system on iPhone after Apple update release
You can ask for a new operating system by going to the Settings app, clicking "General" and then selecting "Software Update."
If the update is ready, the phone gives an option to download and then install it.
Some have had problems since this installation, when a "Software Update Failed" error report has appeared on the screen.
To overcome this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst traffic to pass or try to update via iTunes.
The phone guides the user in the final process.
This may include removing apps to get space, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the update and also eased the process with a new tool that suggests the apps to be deleted and then reinstalles them when the update is completed.
You should make sure the phone is loaded or near the charger during the upgrade, that the battery is not running out.
If the charge level is too low, Apple will not allow the update to proceed, because if the battery runs out, it can result in the upgrade being broken.

You should also make sure that you've gone through our list of all the things you have to do before you download, so that things don't go wrong, and how you can protect yourself from it if they do. iOS 9 brings new features like a much smarter personal assistant and hugely new productivity features for iPad, as well as improvements that speed up and correct the operating system.
Yle: Minister Berner has served on the board of the tax haven company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner (central) has served as a member of the board of the tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company's operations involve so-called tax planning.
It is a Luxembourg-based company called Saltri II LuxCo, whose board member Berner was appointed in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg trade register, Berner is still officially a member of the board.
Berner himself says he filed a resignation notice in May of this year.
I checked it out, and that's enough for me to file a notice of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration chains take place on the agreed schedule, Berner says in Yle's interview.
Membership after merger
The ownership of the Swedish company Kährs is managed through the Luxembourg company.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner served on Karelia-Upoflor's board in 2010-2013 and after the merger in Kährs' board of directors and the Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, Kährs' holdings in Luxembourg go through a multi-stage ownership structure.
Berner says to Yle that he accepted board membership at the request of Kährs' second-largest owner in the Luxembourg company.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been on the board of Karelia-Upoflor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was looking for a partner, which was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a venture capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt it was my job to ensure that the benefits of the Finnish family company's capital were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the income from our Finnish companies' capital is taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context, Berner says.
Berner says to Yle that Hartwall Capital's holdings in the company do not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up in the tax haven is due to the fact that Kährs' largest owner, the private equity fund Triton, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
Espoo opens a reception centre maintained by the company
Espoon Otaniemi opens the first company-run reception centre for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 residents already today, starting at 6 pm.
The number of seats may increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre in the real estate of the former Rescue College.
The operations are maintained by Luona Oy, which is particularly active in the production of healthcare and medical services.
The city of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy agree on security arrangements for the centre, among other things.
STTK is preparing an alternative working life tightening package
STTK will start preparing an alternative package for the government's tightening of working life.
The organisation also hopes to include other employee centre organisations.
President Antti Palola said the attention is currently in Friday's demonstration.
Alternative ways of reducing the cost of work will then be returned.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday," Palola pointed out during the break of the organisation's administration meeting to journalists.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) is not prepared for discussions.
STTK economists have calculated that the change security included in the Government's competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated €30 million, compared to €2,700 million on the other side of the package.
I don't know if the party has the greatest enthusiasm to have a conversation if they have a one-to-one relationship with 100.
Palola: Negotiation has been constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is to make a statement about its own package to the parliament and start preparing reforms.
Palola did not take a stand on whether the timetable is realistic.
According to Palola, there is a discussion connection with the government, and it has been constructive to him all along.
According to Palola, the cutting of Sunday supplements is a painful place, especially in the STTK field.
The organisation requires the government to withdraw from the mandatory legislation by which it would carry out some of the blackmails.
According to Palola, the STTK does not warm up to the fact that the alternative package would be prepared with the SDP that has presented the issue.
Employees will meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the Finnish government's tightening-up package presented last week.
As part of the package, for example, the wages for the first sick days will be cut, overtime pay will be halved, Sunday compensation will be reduced to 75 per cent and holidays will be reduced.
The STTK emphasises that the central organisations have invited employees to a demonstration, and the intention was not to organise a strike.
Akavan Fjäder thanks
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder commends STTK's announcement about preparing an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now in line with Akava, as Akava has for a long time outlined an alternative model for government proposals.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without SAK the package will not be comprehensive enough.
Akava President Sture Fjäder hopes that SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will join in preparing the proposal as an alternative to the cuts.
Antti Palola's STTK said earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, Akava announced that it has been preparing its own proposal for a long time to negotiate a five per cent competitive jump that the government is seeking as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has been ready to negotiate all along, and we have long been writing an alternative model for the government's proposals.
We are ready to see the terms of employment as part of the contract.
In return, we want change security and working time banks, says Chairman Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be on Akava's line, as STTK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model for the government and employers of the country, Fjäder says.
The Akava Bureau will meet on Thursday at 3 pm to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
"Same boat, common coal, wills" - playing bingo while Sipilä talks at night
Green Left of the University of Tampere
Vivan bingo coupon for the Green Left at the University of Tampere for the evening.
The prime ministers have previously given special speeches during Mäntsälä's rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of Finland's economy on Yle channels on Wednesday evening at 9:05 pm.
When applying for a similar Prime Minister's previous speech, it is necessary to go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister when he gave a famous radio speech that marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
After that, the president and ministers gave several radio speeches during the winter and further war.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the train performers' strike with a televised speech.
Lonely call, monarchy action
Sipilä's speech has sparked all day's criticism and speculation about what is to come.
Paavo Arhinmäki, president of the Left Alliance, said on Twitter that "Sipilä could give a speech about the state of the nation in parliament as a Prime Minister's announcement, so that the speech could also be discussed."
According to Green Ville Niinistö, "one-calling has already been seen.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
SDP's Erkki Tuomioja condemned Facebook as "monarchist action: the Prime Minister tells the people what's best for them."
SDP chairman Antti Rinne challenged Sipilä to the dialogue: "Soon six months after the election.
Not a single appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's tried.
What is @juhasipila afraid of?
Public service
According to the Government Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and lasts about 15 minutes.
SAK said it was commented on live by SAK president Lauri Lyly and EK CEO Jyri Häkämies.
Yleä has been criticised for making Sipilä's speech.
We considered the matter and said that it is part of the public service mission to promote the full publicity of Finland, a line in Yle's news by Ismo Silvo Yle, Director of Publications.
♪ Like We're in Tammelas time ♪
The speech has also sparked blasphemousness.
When the evening comes, the dinner will be enjoyed in good time, the children will be combed and dressed for their best.
My mother puts on a prettier dress, and my father puts a tie around his neck.
At nine o'clock, the television was silenced as it was in the old days of Me Tammelas," writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä also say in his speech why there are millionaires in the Finnish government who are hiding their capital in tax havens, who make pardon laws for other tax evaders and at the same time claim to the people that they have to cut when the state has run out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
From what Sipilä says, one guess is made by the Green Left Viva of the University of Tampere.
It has published the bingo on Facebook.
Will we hear about the same boat, the common carbon, living in debt and team spirit in the evening?
The coupons and pens are ready, it starts at 9:05 pm and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in the Guardian: Western countries rejected Russia's proposal to overthrow al-Assad
More than three years ago, the West rejected Russia's offer to get Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to give up power, says President Martti Ahtisaari to Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the UN proposed a plan that would have allowed al-Assad to give way in style after a while.
However, the Western countries did not take up the proposal because they believed Al-Assad would fall anyway in a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed a three-point plan in a bilateral discussion: the opposition was not to be armed, the opposition had to be immediately connected to Al-Assad, and the resignation of al-Assad had to be carried out in a subdued manner.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on all things, but we can talk openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said, "Sit down, Martti, and I'll tell him what we have to do," Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
The diplomats do not comment
Ahtisaari says he delivered the message from Tshurkin to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion to the newspaper, but Ahtisaari said there are no two words about it.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said al-Assad's forces had already committed several massacres at that time and the main opposition groups refused any agreements that would have left him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the Middle East Department of the British Foreign Ministry, is hesitant about Ahtisaari's speeches, because, according to his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss Al-Assad's fate.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari's claim is that Tshurkin spoke under Moscow's authority.
If he had told me about what Tshurkin said, I would have replied that I want to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, even then he would have suspected that it was Putin's trick to keep power over some al-Assad supporter.
A flow of refugees from our own works
During the negotiations in Ahtisaari, about 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
According to UN estimates, the number of deaths exceeded 220,000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have had to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees to Europe is our own doing.
I see no alternative but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we ourselves caused," Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
Asylum seeker's organisation centre työllä Tornio
The Government's plan to organise asylum seekers in northern Finland is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in a building in the centre of the city, which is an empty building of the Tornio joint analysis.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable place to better control the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
On Tuesday, Helsingin Sanomat reported that the council would have already decided to present the school building as a space solution to the Ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppinen (left), vice-president of Tornio City Council, that is not true.
When the whole council was not together and some of the group wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he would specify to STT.
There were 36 of the 43 delegates present at the discussion.
The organizing centre was opposed by 13 delegates.
Based on that, one could expect a positive decision, says Hyöppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city received contact on Monday, and a quick response was received.
An estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time could be accommodated in the joint statement.
An expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple of hundred metres from the border, so it would also work in that sense, says Nousiainen.
Sipilä still wants an alternative to blackmail from the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center), the public halving of holiday money would only cover part of the government's goal of reducing the cost of work.
However, the government will be happy to accept an alternative package if the labour market organisations manage to agree on that.
Sipilä told journalists in the parliament that she has not been in contact with labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously the organisations were looking for replacement measures for the government's announced tightening of working life.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä's view, halving the holiday pay would be a tool, since it would target almost all wage earners, unlike, for example, the government's planned cut in Sunday supplements.
Labour market organisations could agree among themselves to cut holiday money because they are written in collective agreements instead of law.
The government will be reporting to the parliament next Wednesday on the tightening of working life as a government statement.
According to Sipilä, the organisations' proposals should be known before this.
This is not the final deadline either.
The legislative work will then begin, i.e. the train will be on the move and it will become increasingly difficult.
There's plenty of time.
It won't take long for things like this to happen, if there is a will, Sipilä said.
The list published by the government last week includes, among other things, the conversion of Epiphany and Helatorista into unpaid holidays without shortening the annual working hours.
In addition, the pay for the first days of illness will be cut, overtime pay will be halved, Sunday compensation will be reduced to 75 per cent and holidays will be reduced.
Reforms are carried out as mandatory legislation past the trade unions, which has attracted strong criticism.
On Friday, wage-earner central organisations are organising a big demonstration for the actions, and several trade unions have declared political strikes.
The council of Tohmajärvi approved the expansion of the Mahlahall warehouse
The council of Tohmajärvi unanimously approved the expansion of the stock of Nordic Koivu Oy, or mahlahall, which is a bit of a nurturing.
The criticism was caused by the fact that the project is bigger and more expensive than was originally said.
Also a busy schedule with heartburn.
There was also a bit of a wonder that the need for space was not known a year ago when the previous expansion was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of the warehouse at 400-450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but the money will be decided later in the interim report.
There was still talk of an investment of between 150 000 and 200 000 euros on the agenda, but at the meeting, technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the price is estimated to be 300,000 euros.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it brings work and tax revenue to the locality.
There is no risk for the municipality, as the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) explained.
There is also room for Karelian language in Joensuu
The city government eased its previous steep stance to bring street name signs in Karelian language to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct in terms of fostering Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of Karelian language, because there are no historical grounds for it, and Karelian language is not a natural part of the region's identity.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more part of the eastern Savonian dialects.
Even after a new decision, there will be no street name signs in Karelian language in the city centre.
However, the City of Joensuu is also ready for Karelian language use, for example in information boards and tourism marketing, on a case-by-case basis.
The city recommends the same approach to all other actors.
Even though Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, it is also worth a broad-minded approach to the use of Karelian language now that multiculturalism lives and changes strongly in North Karelia.
Karelian language is still a peculiarity of the region, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of Finland.
Both can well be used in the multi-disciplinary marketing of the region.
The closure of train connections cuts the vitality of the region
The cuts in train connections hit the vitality of the province with a hard hand.
The transport connections have a direct impact on the region's business life and competitiveness.
And that makes it possible to live and work here in the first place, says Kari Karjalainen, Mayor of Joensuu.
He also highlights air traffic, which has also been the subject of several reflections.
It is important for the whole region that our chances are not reduced by government measures, as is happening now.
We should look at the effects of these traffic closures on employment, for example, Karjalainen emphasises.
The deterioration of transport connections poses a further challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees, says Jukka Mönkkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor connections also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot because of the study.
Marko Junkrinen, the recruitment manager, says that already marketing the university towards western Finland is difficult because the connections are weak in the transverse direction.
Currently, about half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
About 10-20 per cent of them are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by a direct train connection.
Joensuu became one gravel voice for Siu's sote
Joensuu City Board's view of the provincial Siun sote project is seemingly unanimous, but one of the gravel voices is also present.
The city board member Pentti Keskisalo (sd., in the picture) presented the government's Monday meeting to abandon the whole project, but his presentation was unsound.
The board approved the draft decision of Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed in early October before the city council meeting, which will make a final statement on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train from Kotka to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger train traffic from Kotka to Kouvola will remain in the future, albeit fewer than one pair of trains.
The passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola will change next March.
One pair of trains will be missed, but still five times a day you can get from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The contractions are caused by the state's austerity measures.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications' purchase money for train traffic for the next four-year period will be reduced by 12.3 million euros.
The quieter routes will be completely discontinued.
VR will prepare new timetables by the end of the year.
They will take effect on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed up to the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys walked away
The rescue department let a 12-year-old who climbed the roof out of a jam, who couldn't get off the roof on his own.
The situation arose in Torniomäki, Ketotie, around 5:30 on Tuesday evening.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladder to the roof.
It did not stop the group of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mast of radio amateurs next to it.
The other boys got down the same way, but one didn't.
As a result, others snuck away and passers-by called the rescue department to help the last man on the roof safely back to the ground.
FedEx's operating profit doubles, decreasing the outlook for tax year 2016
FedEx reported depressing results from the latest quarter, and the delivery giant cut its entire year's profit forecast, due to reduced demand for freight services and higher costs of its ground services.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that it is hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Its share decreased by about 2.5 per cent in the opening auction 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening clock.
FedEx Corp. says it expects the tax year to end next May with $10.40 to $10.90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a FactSet survey.
The smaller outlook came despite the average price increases of 4.9 per cent, which will take effect on 4 January, and despite the higher extra charges that began in November for heavy or large packages on land.
The company said it expects a business profit to increase from the previous year, because they have cut costs, turnover has grown and online trade is growing.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company "will be stable, taking into account weaker economic conditions than expected, especially in production and global trade."
The plans for pay during the holiday were announced the day after the competitor UPS said he was going to hire 90-95 000 extra workers, about the same amount as it did last year.
In the quarter that ended 31 August, FedEx's result was $692 million, which is 6 per cent more than last year.
The profit per share was $2.42, which is $2.44 in the average estimate. The survey by 12 analysts was conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Net sales rose 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
In Zacks' poll, six analysts expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a reduction in international priority transport, which has halted the development of its Express unit's turnover.
However, the rise in the online store has improved FedEx Ground's results.
In the latest quarter, the turnover of the land unit rose by 29 per cent, but the revenues of the operations were basically the same because of the expensive costs of larger packages and insurance.
The Express unit's income was better because of higher basic charges, while the operating profit in freight operations decreased by higher labour costs.
At the opening auction, about an hour before the opening clock, FedEx shares dropped to $3.85, or 2.5 per cent to $150.15.
FedEx closed 11 per cent down for this year on Tuesday and 17 per cent below the record on June 11.
The U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers this week sit around a huge mahogany table for two days at a long-awaited meeting to decide whether the time has come to raise the key rate for the first time in almost a decade.
At the other end of the central bank's decorative, two-storey meeting room is a mural from the United States.
The map is a reminder that the president of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues should put the nation's financial interests above everything else.
Congress has placed a dual responsibility on the Fed's shoulders: they have to maximise US employment and keep prices stable.
After the Great Depression, however, the leaders of the Central Bank have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
It is precisely this third requirement that can be the decisive factor in a decision to be published on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted, and whether the US economy is ready to be weaned from a record incentive that has been brought up to the end of 2008 by the almost zero short-term interest rate level .
While most of the information shows a steady growth in the economy, the recent turmoil in global financial markets may have made the Federal Reserve officials, who are already on guard in advance, even more frightened about increasing volatility, and fear of what it would do if the federal funding rate were raised by at least a quarter.
"I understand that the labour market and inflation are the first and most important things to be monitored," says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economic expert at the brokerage company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I do believe, however, that if they are looking for a justification for re-establishing interest rates, the increased uncertainty on the world market is enough to justify waiting," he said.
There is no agreement on the Central Bank's decision, which is already causing nervousness in the economy.
According to a recent Bloomberg study, about half of the financial experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
The financial markets, on the other hand, expect the Fed to delay the withdrawal, as the key indicator indicates that the potential for growth is only about 30 per cent.
This suggests a decline in the securities market if the central bank raises the level, unless the decision-makers then manage to soften the attack by promising that the next withdrawal will not take place in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average increased by 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent, with a new figure of 16 599.85.
The recovery was brought with it the expectation that the Fed will keep the level unchanged this week, says John Lonski, chief economic expert at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It's surprising if the Fed is raising interest rates right now," he said.
If the decision-makers raise interest rates, "they need to work hard in their policy to support the financial markets so that they don't panic."
Other experts claim that an increased level would calm the financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed will operate.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be raising interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point this month, thus taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of the monetary situation that would ensure the stability of the US recovery.
Yellen has said in the spring and early summer that he expects the level to rise this year, despite the Liberals calling for more economic development in their complaints.
Although the creation of new jobs slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell last month to 5.1 per cent, the lowest figure for seven years and close to the level the Central Bank considers to be the limit on full employment.
Wage growth has shown signs of pick-up.
While inflation is still below the central bank's 2% annual target, the main reason for this, according to the central bank's decision-makers, is the temporary effect of the price of oil that has been significantly lowered.
The economy "clears and needs higher interest rates, taking into account the tight situation on the labour market", says Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics Chief Economics Specialist.
The financial markets around the world, however, were shaken last week as China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell by up to 16 per cent from its record in May, as investors feared China would slow down global growth as well.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now close to 10 per cent below the peak in May.
For central bank decision-makers, market turmoil is an additional factor in a complex equation that tells when the interest rate level should be raised.
"Without these financial market events and recent weeks of news about the weakness of China's economy, the decision-makers would step up at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a special investigator at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Federal Reserve official.
Now he predicts that the decision-makers will wait at least a month to get a better understanding of the effects.
"The potential impact on the US economy is still quite unclear and they do not have much information at their disposal about the consequences of what has happened in China," Oliner said.
The well-being of the international economy is not the central bank's main concern, so in principle it should not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Central Bank has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank's influence has been enormous.
In 2013, Ben S. Bernanken, the then president, hinted that the Central Bank could "reduce" the amount of money, caused upheavals in the market around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, central bank officials are expected not only to follow developments elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The central bank's decision-making process is "more art than science", says Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy of the asset management company Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lecker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Virginia, said this month that "the central bank has previously overreacted to financial market movements that seem to be separate from economic fundamentals."
The Federal Open Market Committee has called for an increase in interest rates, and Mr Lacker, a member entitled to vote, calls for an example of the 1998-99 decisions.
The Asian economic crisis caused the Fed to cut its benchmark by 0.75 percentage points during three meetings "without worrying about its limited, identifiable effects on US economic growth," Mr. Lecker said.
A year later, the Fed reversed these cuts.
The central bank should give priority to economic stability only during a major crisis, as when the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England's interest fixing committee.
The latest turmoil does not come anywhere near its level, says Posen.
"No one wants to be in a situation where interest rates are feared because the market is upset," said Mr. Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics Institute.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a dual requirement and does not mention financial stability, and as long as that is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

Brazilian Pediatrics Association in Rio Grande advertises a healthy diet for breast-feeding women
Brazil's Pediatrics Association (SPRS) has come up with a shocking way of trying to make women understand the importance of good nutrition during breast-feeding by publishing pictures of babies sucking breasts that have painted descriptions of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which give babies all the nutrients needed to develop a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories.
However, the new study suggests that increasing calorie levels is not the only change in diet that mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by a Texas professor at Baylor College of Medicine Robert Waterland revealed that the healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genetic expression of their babies and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise program is a favourite in ratings, despite Nine's attempts to announce the leadership coverage in Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's rush to Canberra to announce the aftermath of the Liberal leader's exposure failed to increase Today's ratings.
Nine's morning show was sent from the country's capital after Malcolm Turnbull overturned Tony Abbott.
The rival program Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Army, was stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international broadcasts that also cover Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The weight of the distance did not seem to interfere with Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 in five state capitals, compared with 339,000 on Today.
Today's average rose slightly compared to Monday's (317,000) and last Tuesday's (283,000), but it was still lower than last Thursday's (343,000).
Today has caught Sunrise in recent months.
In August, the average for Today was 318,000 and Sunrise 330.000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varied between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
So far, during September, Sunrise averages 349,000 viewers, compared to 314,000 on Today.
This is the most interesting event this morning.
The winds of change are blowing this morning, not just in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!

Seven's big news was the amazing first performance of the 800-word series, the former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama series, which collected a fairly impressive 1.219 million viewers average, tells about a recently widowed father who decides to move to the New Zealand coast with his two children.
Critics have wondered whether Thomson is the driving force of the popular series alone without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave this real certainty.
Seven The X Factor was a strong favourite with 1,136 million viewers, easily winning The Block (838,000) and the TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had a dual destiny on the second night of The Chase Australia series.
The first half-hour (17-17.30) of the new quiz programme hosted by Andrew O'Keefe gathered a mediocre of 446,000 viewers.
Another half-hour (17.30-18) rose to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat programme (613,000).
On Monday evening, The Chase Australia's first half-hour viewer average was 520,000, and the second half-hour was a staggering 720.000.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
The Chase Australia's fall in second-night viewer average gives Nine the confidence that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular programme at 5.30 pm.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minutes, which failed to reduce McGuire's ratings.

The final trio agrees with dad that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
The secret has been revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markkoski could accidentally reveal who won The Bachelor.
The identity of that woman has been kept extremely secret, with which Sam Wood ends up in The Bachelor.
The three girls left are definitely not slipping who got the last rose.
However, while we were talking to Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before the three became two, they could unwittingly give a clue about the identity of the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's final.
All three women became poetic when they told how Wood is the perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, ambition, family value and positivity as reasons why they would want to be his partner.
But when they were asked, "If Wood's last rose isn't for you, who should it go to?", their answers may have provided a revelation of who won the bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markkoski quickly mentioned Mackay as the best option for Wood after them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been uncomplicated since the first day.
"From the moment I walked in the house (Sarah's) energy and Sam's energy seemed quite compatible, and that thought was on my mind throughout the series," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is really down to earth, it's fun to be around her," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's chemistry between them.
They feel comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a great match.
Mackay said last week's home visits made him realize Wood could be "the one."
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game - I am now wholeheartedly involved in this," he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say," he said.
I like the girls that are left just as much, so it's a tie between Snesana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday at 7.30 pm on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne has many options to start his NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both quite interested after he moved to the United States, and many other teams have been asking about him since his impressive open rehearsal day at the end of last year.
However, Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers team and coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game after this Australian rugby league convert dropped the ball in his first kick back when the team beat Minnesota on Tuesday with 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and allowed Hayne to return the next flight kick and brought him into the running game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula's true character was also visible in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of calling his new recruits a battalion in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a post-game press conference.
49ers' specialist Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped the kick that Minnesota Vikings caught in the first quarter
This really wasn't the start Hayne and her numerous Australian fans wanted for the man's NFL debut.
Hayne was seen cursing on the way from the airport after the drop, and later he told the Australian radio pair team Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM on 104.1 that he couldn't have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"It was just one of these things, you just have to think about the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared her haparing to her 2007 Origin debut, as the pass in her own goal area led to Queensland's goal.
All in all, it was still a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed in a photo published on his Instagram account with fans holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at gunpoint on a Siberian runway.
Khodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was seized, and his attempts to support democracy were limited.
4 died while police fired rubber bullets against protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, died in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into a crowd that protested against the country's new draft constitution, the official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place Tuesday evening in the Rupandeh region about 175 miles west of the capital Kathandus.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the chief official in the area, said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, some of them throwing rocks and fire bombs.
Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, known to have killed but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, appeared to have caused so many deaths.
The confrontation was the latest in weeks of violent demonstrations across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of the ethnic group called Madhesi say that the new provinces established under the proposed new constitution will undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in Western Nepal, when the Tharus group demands its own state.
Since 10 August, at least 40 people have died in violent clashes, 11 of which have been police officers.
At that time, four main parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - this is a big step towards a new constitution, but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, which has had a central government for centuries.
The new constitution has been planned since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
The legislators have voted this week on the clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and the authorities have said that the new charter could be adopted by Sunday.
U.S. National Hurricane Center NHC says there is a 60 percent chance of a hurricane south of Cape Verde
On the broad low-pressure front, which is about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde island group, there is a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical hurricane in the next 48 hours, the US National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
On the other closely defined low-pressure front, which is halfway between the Cape Verde island group and the Little Antilles, there is also a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next two days, the weather forecast centre in Miami added.
Google launches a donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GooGL.O) published a donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organisations that help thousands of refugees to Europe as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal perspective when it published a donation campaign blog.
Instead of being reported by a manager, Google employee Rita Masoud wrote about her own personal experience, who, at the age of seven, fled Kabul with her family.
"Our journey included numerous dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, coldness and darkness," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family are desperate to help.
The donations are given to four non-profit organisations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it will match every donation made on google.com/refugeerelief worldwide to $5.5 million, with a total goal of $11 million.
Europe is experiencing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, mainly due to the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people from their homes this year.
Many also flee from war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery can help mildly obese diabetics
According to a new study, the benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese type 2 diabetics can last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics will live longer after a weight loss surgery than those who are treated in other ways than surgery.
"It takes a long time to get the death data," Dr. Robin Blackstone said, who is an expert on weight loss surgery who wrote an editorial on a new study in JAMA Surgery.
Different methods of reducing stomach size are used for weight loss or bariatric surgery.
They reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the people in the study have been sickly obese and have had 35 or more BMIs.
BMI, or weight ratio to height, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If BMI is over 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if BMI is over 30, they are considered obese.
You can count your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the purpose of this new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery, and stomach reduction, to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of the cut persons dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, BMI remained roughly the same in 29 of the people who were treated by other means than surgery.
Thirty-six per cent of the cut-off persons had a complete improvement in diabetes and 28 per cent had a partial improvement.
By comparison, in the drug-treated group, diabetes resolved completely by only 1% and partly by about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL column "were generally better in the surgery group," the authors said.
Researchers also monitored patients' blood hemoglobin A1c levels, which reflect long-term blood glucose levels.
Hemoglobin A1c should remain below 7%, researchers write.
Post-operative hemoglobin level A1c dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the medical treatment group, it remained stable at about 8%.
But this better "glycemic control" described by improved hemoglobin A1c levels did not reduce mortality over five years, says chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The study group also compared the average results between two different types of surgery.
At the fifth year, when compared to the gastric surgery group, the gastric bypass surgery group had lost more weight (18,7 and 14,2 kg), decreased its BMI more (7.4 and 5.1), decreased its hemoglobin A1c levels more (3.1 percent and 2.1 percent), and had more likely achieved complete diabetes remission (46.9 percent and 16.7 percent respectively).
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix Blackstone says that even though the study does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are findings from Sweden, where the surgery led to a longer life for heavier people.
A Swedish study found that obese people who had had a weight loss surgery had a 29 percent lower chance of dying over a period of 15 years when compared to a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
While the new study does not show an improvement in the survival of surgical patients, Blackstone says the results are encouraging for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in surgery.
"The results of the study are crucial precisely in showing that the surgery is safe for the lower body mass index group," he said, and there is no increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously when the patient's BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long before we take this seriously," he said.
I believe that once a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation.
"Not everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is found in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to the violence in the refugees' home countries.
Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in a speech she gave at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion Centre in Oxford at the beginning of her ten-day visit to Britain, dedicated to ethical research.
The Dalai Lama claimed that, in the current situation, the needs of all mankind should be put ahead of the individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that the Western European countries' response to the refugee crisis, although admirable, is also inadequate.
"Not everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria for their actions in the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"It's great to take care of several thousand refugees, but in the meantime you have to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The ultimate thing is to think about how we can reduce the killing in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In taking a stand on the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the violent response from the United States caused violent events in the chain.
"After 9/11-Isku, I expressed my condolences to President Bush in a letter and told him that the solution to this problem can be found through non-violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and created unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
In the last four years, the swallowing of a child's hand-disinfectant has increased fourfold
Poisoning Focal Points across the United States have reported an almost 400% rise in the swallowing of high alcohol-containing hand-drying agent for children under 12 years of age since 2010, says Georgia Poison Information Centre.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, head of the Georgia Poison Information Centre, the cases of swallowing disinfectants reported to the poison information centres for children under 12 years of age rose from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"Children are more interested in these products and, unfortunately, a certain percentage of them are going to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
He said some children drink disinfectant on purpose, while others want to impress their friends or meet the challenge on social media.
There are videos on YouTube where teenagers drink disinfectant to get a cheap high-rise.
According to reports, teenagers have mixed disinfectant with alcoholic mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
Pleasant scents of disinfectant can tempt younger children.
"The child doesn't think this is bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (handides) are the ones with the scent added.
There are strawberry, grape and orange-scented disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
A hand sanitizer can contain any alcohol between 45 and 95 per cent.
Especially in small children, only a few sprays are needed for alcohol poisoning.
"It's really concentrated alcohol," Mr. Stephen Thornton told Fox 4 in Kansas City, the head of the University of Kansas Poison Center.
So please don't leave the whiskey shot lying on the table, but leave the hand sanitizer out, and if children are interested, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaiiah Russell is a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed just four squirts of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school and was taken to the emergency room to be treated.
His blood alcohol level was .179, twice as high as the adult drunk driver's limit, says emergency medical doctor Chris Ritchey, who treated a girl outside Atlanta at the Gwinnet Medical Center.
Nhaiiah mossed while talking and couldn't walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors followed him overnight in a separate children's hospital for possible brain damage symptoms, as alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"It was really scary," Nhaijah's mother Ortoria Scott said to CNN.
The situation could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or alcohol swabs and remove the disinfectant from children's reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a hand sanitizer containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
Health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was reported as an active ingredient.
In January, in the north of New York state, three fourth graders planned to poison their "bad" teacher by spreading bacterial poison into the classroom, reports a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand sanitizer and banned it from her class.
The police consider the plan to be a "drunk nonsense" and leave disciplinary action to the school district.
Rumour mill: Celtic has no conflict
Griffiths downgrades the talk about Celtic conflict, and Deila admits he's in a tight spot, but he can turn it around.
Hearts is fighting the Scottish Football Federation for Neilson's charges, and Warburton is on guard against January recruitments that could disrupt the team's unity
Dons increased his lead to Celtic to five points
Adam Rooney's first-half penalty shot led Aberdeen to a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium, allowing the team to increase the difference to Celtic to five points.
Griffiths is underestimating what he said about conflict
There have been rumours about Celtic's internal conflicts, but Griffiths immediately passed them, claiming that he and his teammates have no sense of working under close scrutiny as the team is preparing to meet the Dutch serial leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are waiting to meet.
The lack of a Scottish championship bores the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition for a championship with Rangers.
Ajax's current ambassador de Boer said: "There will be no more Celtic highlights in Holland, and why?"
Because the Rangers aren't involved.
People around here can't just talk about Rangers coming back.
They're talking about Old Firm teams.
They talk about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There are a lot of tensions in the games of these teams, and non-Scotlanders also want to watch those games.
Deila swears to turn the situation around
Ronny Deila has admitted Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn the situation around.
The defeat to Malmö and the resulting fall from the Champions League was quickly followed by a defeat to Aberdeen, who played with ten men, who is now at the top of the series with a five-point difference to the next.
But Deila said: "Celtic has had bad episodes before, and we will rise again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
So are we, but we have to keep going.
We really need supporters, because it will improve the performance of the players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton's watch over January's player transfers
Even though Rangers boss Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on the possible targets for January's player transfers, he is on guard from the most recruitmenting frenzy to assure that he does not want to confuse the team's consensus.
Former Brentford boss said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
For the players coming in the summer, there is an adjustment period all the way ahead of time, which will be seen in our team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can do more harm.
Celtic interest Michu hints retirement
Swansea's attacker Michu, whose name is linked to Celtic in connection with the transfer window, has hinted that he can retire after his contract with Swans ends.
A 29-year-old player has had ankle problems for two years, and during the summer he was unable to find new company outside Wales.
Hearts is ready to fight the Scottish Football Federation for Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team then lost 3-2. The defenseman's red card was later overturned, and this was the third red card already condemned by Collum in the last eight months.
Neilson stands by what he said, saying: "I didn't question honesty, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The loyal Hibernian player was rebuked for admitting to singing an offensive song about the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in Roseburn, Edinburgh, before Edinburgh's derby at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was derby and it was a momentary impulse," the attacker added, adding: "It's safe to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I go play Celtic."
Tannadice's government believes in Dundee United's leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that Dundee United's government still has faith in the leadership team's ability to turn the situation around, but admits that the players' deterioration must stop.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're going to get the boys back together," Donnelly says.
McInnes happy about the "ugly win" in Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperate to be involved in the game against Hamilton Aces, but thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty kick, he managed to achieve his seventh consecutive league win that put them at the top of the table five points above Celtic.
McInnes says: "There is no team that has won anything, whether it's a trophy or a league that wouldn't have won games like this."
Scottish unemployment will remain the same as the UK's total number grows
UNEMPLOYMENT in Scotland remained 164,000 people between May and July, while unemployment in the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million.
Scotland's unemployment rate 5.9 per cent is higher than the UK 5.5 per cent, according to the figures from the National Statistical Institute (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12,000 people over a three-month period, and the number of employed persons is now 2,612,000.
The Scottish employment rate fell to 74% during the quarter, which is higher than the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Scottish State Secretary David Mundell commented on these latest figures: "The government's long-term plan is to build a basis for a stronger economy."
Nearly exactly a year has passed since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK.
During these 12 months, the labour market in Scotland has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has fallen.
Why I Witness the Execution in Oklahoma
If there is no legal intervention, later today I will watch him be executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I will be sitting in the viewers' gallery in Oklahoma State Penitentiary watching Richard Glossip be executed with a lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
I received the request in January through his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
I've begun to dread this day as it approaches.
So why did I say yes?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
Of course, journalists have the opportunity to watch executions in America, and since there are often more applications than there are available places, the participants are selected through a terrible draw.
Oklahoma has reduced the seats reserved for the media from 12 to 5.
Whoever is chosen will watch the event cool.
I can't do it.
I will be sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have also created my own connection to him through phone calls made over the months, as well as a two-hour and a half-hour visit.
I like him.
We laugh often when we talk.
Prison officials say I can't be both a witness and a reporter, so I'm not allowed to carry a notebook and a pen to save what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
On Twitter, a journalist from Oklahoma accused me of compromising my neutrality.
Here's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants you to, and you'll get to participate.
I complained to the reporter.
He admitted that "could have set his words better," but still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
He won't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do that even if he said so.
I've told him he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants there to be an international journalist who will write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help a trend against the death penalty.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is beside me.
If you want to know more about the case, you can listen to a series of podcasts I've made.
I will not go over all the details again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Tree's murder would in any case make him guilty of aiding.
But I think there's a very strong chance he hasn't committed murder.
I'm sure there wasn't enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think it's wrong to execute him.
And so this is the perspective I think he's going to die from.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
There will be other journalists who will take care of it.
I give you a description of how it feels to watch a man I like die unnecessarily.
The man was lured out of Canning River after a watery police hunt
Canning Vale's officer remained dry when he lured him out of the Canning River.
A man from Perth's attempt to distract the police went wrong when he found himself in a shallow, muddy water just a few feet from a police man who tried to "inspire him gently back to the beach."
Canning Vale police were called to Beckenham on Tuesday for trespassing.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to distract them by heading for the Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
"He was standing in the water saying 'I'm not coming away, come get me'," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to get wet, so he used a safer tactic: "a proper police conference."
"Sometimes people do funny things trying to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
The champion footballer Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing and tried to swim across Swan River.
He did not succeed in his attempt, but inspired the locals to start planning a playful Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims the reporters tried to spy on him and threatens to stop competing
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria officials tried to infiltrate his stables last year, threatening to stop racing immediately.
He accuses journalists and Racing Victoria's integrity division, claiming they have a personal campaign against him, and on Wednesday the late rejection of Lady Tatai because of the treatment on the day of the race was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for the competition, and that he has been in a difficult situation after Lidar's unexplained positive cobalt sample.
He's been keeping his tongue in check about spy claims for a year and a half, and he didn't want it to look "jealous."
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so frustrated that it all bursts out at once," Moody said.
They knew the situation continued.
Sometimes I just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'm going home tonight and sleeping well.
I want to walk with my head up and I want the owners to think I'm doing my best for them.
When they start thinking differently, then I shouldn't continue as a coach.
Then I would have to consider what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview on racing.com, where he said the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - I name him when asked - and offered him a job in my stables if he relayed information about what I was doing there.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, surely they should fire their lawyers, for they have failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former President of Racing Victoria, David Moody, current President of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Sundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I begin to think that this is becoming personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to man up and perhaps pass on responsibility to non-coachers about what is happening in the industry?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe that's what people think.
Maybe they have to take my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying here will possibly make them think about that.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, and that saddens me.
It really saddens me.
I pressure them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach's frustration has grown with the long-standing Lidar cobalt study, and late rejection made him say he could "throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known for coaching the undefeated champion Black Caviar, has called the race-day treatment rule "featureable" after mud or clay baths have been put on horse feet, which is illegal.
"It's against the rules of the competition.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put mud on its leg.
It could have had a grave last night.
It could have had it yesterday, just like it did.
It had it on the day of the race.
Moody may be faced with a three-month ban on competition due to the day of the race's grave care, on which the trustees began a study.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about a horse.
"We all understand the need for rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Driver arrested in Cobram
The police have arrested a man who was responsible for a traffic escape after hitting a cyclist in Cobram this weekend.
The cyclist was transported by air to Royal Melbourne Hospital after serious injuries when the car hit him on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver drove away and did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday a 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported himself to the police in Shepparton.
He will be accused of not stopping in an accident, of failing to provide assistance and of other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in the hospital and is stable.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy attacks rivals on wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticised two NRL rugby league champions' claims that his team's tackles are part of the "line."
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm to "wrestle" on its own side when it surprisingly won the final round in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett could barely cover up his reference to Storm after winning the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night in the final screening, calling the game "the display window" of the rugby league, saying that two Queensland teams were not "very excited" about wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's tackles and said they were just focusing on "contact" in the tackle.
Bellamy added that his confidence was enhanced by two leading coaches' criticisms of Storm, which means they're afraid they're going to lose to the team.
"This always comes up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we lost 24-2 to them," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything in our defence systems or techniques all year long, and in the last six weeks we've just focused on contact in tackles, and it's made us succeed.
Trent has been on the team for three years, and he obviously has a great team to coach, so he's probably not used to losing, and this was a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "an exciting rugby" by reminding his mentor that Bennett-trained St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing "stupidly."
Wayne is talking about an exciting rugby.
He thought it was important to compare his Saturday night game with our Friday night game and tell how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 how St George was often criticised for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn't care less.
But now he has a team that can play the kind of rugby we find exciting, especially when he has fast young friends.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have players of that type.
He brought that up in 2010, now he wants everyone to play rugby in his style - not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play like that.
I get more confident when they say things like that because they're a bit worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as a match for important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and Roosters was more point-rich than the one between Broncos and the Cowboys.
Broncos was certainly a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two more goals, but is it exciting rugby?
Or does it make it an exciting line of defense to break and not score?
For me, this is about guidelines.
If they mention us, it means that somewhere we can play against them.
Storm is free this weekend because they have already won the right to a home game either against the North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks for the pre-final next Saturday night in AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale next Tuesday morning.
Serb man bailing $200,000 on drug charges
A man threatened with a possible life sentence for an attempted possession of 40 kilos of cocaine smuggled to Queensland has been released for $200,000 in bail.
29-year-old Marko Maksimovic is one of five men arrested last month after the federal police had tracked 100 kilos of the drug to Solay hunt, which came to South America through Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting other defendants at the marina all morning and then met them at the Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilos of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Although Maksimovic is threatened with a potential life sentence for attempted possession of a quantity of cocaine for business, his lawyer claimed that there was no evidence that Maksimovic tried to hold the whole amount and that he could be in a cafe for totally innocent reasons.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maksimovic is trying to escape.
"He has fixed connections to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal court case, Maksimovic lied to the police about where he lived.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather had together offered a $200,000 bail to secure his release.
"After reading the sworn testimony of both people, it is clear that setting a $200,000 bail is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
But that alone was not enough to stop him from appearing in court, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on condition that he surrenders both his Australian and Serbian passports, reports to the police every day, and maintains his curfew between 6 p.m. and 6 p.m.
Stevan Hogg used her phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
The child molester used the 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for pictures of child abuse.
While the girl was sleeping, Stevan Hogg took her phone and then logged in to an online communication service, where Hogg received numerous immoral photos of the children sent to her by another user.
The girl later woke up, found the phone missing and found it in Hogg's sleeping hand.
She checked her phone and found shocking messages, and then immediately told her mother.
When the police arrived, they saw five images, searched the computers on the scene, and found "careful" online searches using keywords used to search for immoral images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this "to tempt paedophiles" on the internet before he "proclaimed to be a police officer to scare them."
Fiscal depute representative Eilidh Robertson told Dundeen Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - he is dependent on scaring people.
He admitted that he had done the searches on the computer but said they were only done because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer so he could scare the paedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations with an unknown person who sent him the photos, and about Hogg asking him to send them extra photos.
Hogg said he only did this for bait purposes.
He said after drinking, he's sick in the head, and he wants to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added: "When she found the pictures on her phone, she shouted at her mother, shaking and crying.
Mother saw the immoral images on the phone and then met the accused.
The girl was interviewed and told that the accused had used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
23-year-old Hogg, who lives on Ward Road in Dundee, pleaded guilty of making or taking pictures of immoral children on 14 June last year, violating his bail on 25 January of this year, and failed to appear before the court on 24 March this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked not to put Hogg in the register of sex offenders, as it can be argued that his crime did not include a "significant sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the sentence until October to give Social Services time to prepare background reports.
Hogg was given bail in this case, but in other ongoing cases he is in custody before the hearing.
He was added to the sex offenders register before the date of the sentence.
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe gave the wrong speech to Parliament
Earlier this year, Africa's oldest leader, Mugabe, fell on the steps leading to the podium.
He was not injured, but the video of the crash spread like a virus on social media.
The opening of the parliament was also stained by the opposition legislators' claims that anonymous death threats had been sent to them, warning them not to boo Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they booed him and interrupted him with cry-out while he was giving a speech to Parliament on the state of the country - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) group discipline supervisor Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to disturb Mugabe's speech.
"The number from which the message was sent does not answer, but the message is entitled 'death'," Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warned the members concerned that immunity would end in parliament, and when they stepped out, parliamentary immunity would not be effective.
The group discipline supervisor said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "concerned" about threats against its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard cuts up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut 25 000 to 30 000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost cuts efforts in business services.
Later this year, HP will be divided into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer business from its faster-growing corporate hardware and service operations.
The expected job cuts bring with them costs of about $2.7 billion, starting from the fourth quarter, HP's release said.
"These restructuring measures will allow a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP's chairman and CEO, who will lead the unit after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than today's HP, and we will have a wide and deep range of services that will help companies move to new business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
The annual turnover of Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be more than $50 billion, and it will "focus on producing unmatched integrated technology solutions" for companies, says the company's press release.
Jako breaks up the company that Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, graduates at Stanford University, set up in the 1930s to manufacture electrical equipment, operating in a garage in Palo Alto called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has been going through a huge restructuring to cope with the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the world's second-largest computer manufacturer and one of the biggest technology companies in the USA, and its division is the latest in a field based on the belief that strictly limited companies will perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must support injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb's draw
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is only September now, assuming that his rehabilitation is going according to plan, there is no reason why he should not be playing again by Christmas.
Even in this best case, Wilshire will miss at least the next four games in England, and, given his background, it is uncertain whether he will take part in next summer's European Championship.
The biggest pity about this latest problem is that Wilshere's end of last season was strong after a single ankle injury, and he remembered his old sharpness before the season began.
"This kind of injury does not threaten a career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing weird.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also admitted, there is always a risk of further injuries as the player tries to return in the middle.
There is also an uncomfortable model in the formation.
Studies by Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilshere has suffered 23 different injuries since his debut six years ago.
In addition, during the last five seasons, he has played only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games.
Looking at Arsenal's wider picture since the 2007-08 season, in six of the eight seasons it has been one of the Valio League teams that has lost most days due to the injury.
Wenger admits the possibility of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that their last season's improvement to injury statistics will continue.
"Sometimes when the injury is returned, there can be a vulnerable period when you need to strengthen the body and acquire competition," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get over it.
I hope his body will stabilize, I'm sure it will, and he will make the career he deserves.
Wenger is preparing to recycle his team as Arsenal begins his Champions League game on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb, then playing against Chelsea on Saturday and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be on the way.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to maintain balance and give the players who need it a break," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear continuation of the F block, Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the scariest in Europe.
Dinamo has also not lost in 41 matches since they produced their own "Invincible" campaign last season.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night by an earthquake of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal has learned from the surrender of last season's Champions League against Monaco and is still motivated by a distant dream to lead the team to its first European Cup victory.
"This motivation is enormous," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I can be realistic.
We are ambitious, but not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about male friendship
It is striking how there are no similar descriptions in the series, especially given that men's need to open up is more desperate than ever, and young men's suicide rates are higher than in 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the main cause of death among 20-45-year-old men in Britain, and it is three times more common among men than among women.
The attempt to tackle the problem was announced by Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) for a year of men in 2015 to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
A recent study involved more than 2,000 upper secondary school and upper secondary school students who showed depression symptoms, saying the person's chances of recovery doubled if a sufficiently high percentage of his friends were "healthy."
Similarly, those who were not depressed had a half chance of having possible mental health problems if they had healthy friends.
But for friendship to work, it must be available first.
In this social media time of communication, style goes past content and the immediateity of the answer is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to look strong, happy and successful, even though in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by the values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status, all at the expense of internal values - internal longing for personal growth and friendship - that affect our deeper mental health.
And as a billionaire video game developer recently explained, money certainly does not bring greater happiness.
The great thing about Friends was that it turned this focus on its head.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but rather their personalities, which stood out clearly in the interaction as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs watching football, Ross missing Rachel - their humor came from the knowledge that yes, men can relate to all of this, even though they often hesitate to study their feelings completely.
As a Samaritans volunteer explained to me: "As I listen to people who are depressed and suicidal, I have really understood how even the smallest interaction with a friend can make you feel better."
Often the men who contact us feel they can't talk to friends.
The old idea of "overcoming" is strong, as well as the feeling that if you open up to problems, you see it as weak.
Friends is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term survival methods.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
Although my neutral, outside position at the other end of the phone helps people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal network of family and friends.
And so if you're going to come to comedy central's FriendsFest this weekend, and all the locations have been redesigned to celebrate, why don't you take your friends for coffee in Central Perk.
Or, better yet, if you see someone in Starbucks alone, smile and say hello.
You can never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends will be sent on Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, to participate in #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG slap Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan against goals Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored a goal in his Champions League debut, helping PSG to bypass Swedish team Malmo on Tuesday.
Below is the match report and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started his Champions League game with a nice 2-0 win against Malmo at Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored the Champions League in her debut for less than four minutes, pointing the way to the French league champions, but the team lost several chances before finally increasing their head start as Cavan hit the goal at 61 minutes.
Paris, who is in "A" with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish league champion, because it wasn't just an extension but also an improvement in their quarter finals in the last three rounds
But even though PSG scored, it wasn't a classic game, because Laurent Blanc's team Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the spot in front of the goal and later changed from the field. Malmö is his old hometown team and the team in which he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away from the Champions League, so the 2-0 win is a problem for your opponent and looks good in the statistics, and it's a good start, even though there are things we're going to have to work on this season," Blanc said.
This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, even though I regret that we failed to score more than one or two goals.
After the injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team in one of the three changes made after his 2-2 tie in Ligue 1 home game against Bordeaux this weekend, but he was overshadowed by Di Maria for the fourth minute.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, an Argentine winger was named a man who takes PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why when Marco Verratt's pass ran behind Malmo's defensive line and then struck a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland to the back corner of the net.
However, if someone expected PSG to win an easy and big victory, they were disappointed.
Malmö was a stuffy opponent who won Celtic in a match when he reached this level, with nine international players and a five-man defense and two players in a deep centre field in the opening field.
But on the offensive side, the team offered little more than Nikola Djurdjic's shot at the 34th minute, which barely passed Kevin Trapp's goalpost.
Instead, PSG was sometimes in trouble because of lost pitches and poor finishing, especially from Ibrahimovic, who failed in five attempts only during the first half and then was disappointed when Cavani put the ball in from Ibrahimovic's touch at the very beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more effective in pre-working for his colleagues, and it was from Ibrahimovic's pitch that Di Maria sent a spiral kick that leaned around Wiland's goalpost at 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour's game, thanks to Cavani, who hit his sixth goal in the season, after Ibrahimovic hit Maxwell's cross pass from the left.
That was the end of Malmö's hopes of getting back into the game, and only Wiland's brilliant rejection of David Luiz's direct kick kept the final numbers down before Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal from the change was rejected at the very end of the game.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was as high as his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
The qualifying matches are not enough.
I'll put on a hat for Paris.
This was a great game for them.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion in stock sales
The mining industry in Switzerland was left by Glencore, who suffered from a drop in commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its extensive debt-cutting plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, reported in a notification that it had sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to reduce its debt.
A company that lost 57 per cent of its market value this year is struggling with the prices of collapsed commodities, as the Chinese economy's slowing down puts a strain on demand and destroys all markets.
The new subscription brought Glencore's shares to the top of the London stock exchange in the morning shops on Wednesday.
The shares rose by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence in the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore had revealed a $2.5 billion share deal in the previous week as part of its wider plan to cut its debt burden of $30 billion by about a third.
The company sold new share capital for 125 pence shares, which meant a 2.4 per cent discount on Tuesday's closing price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares, worth a total of 9.99 per cent of the group.
Concerns over the long-standing halting of China's growth have cut iron ore prices by about half, while coal, copper and other commodities prices have dropped by 20-40 per cent.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, confirmed in a statement published by the White House on Tuesday.
Xi's first official visit to Washington takes place on September 25 and is the answer to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November, the statement said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will arrange dinner for Xi and her spouse Peng Liyuan after the leaders have held bilateral talks.
"The visit by Prime Minister Xi will enable us to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while at the same time allowing President Obama and President X to discuss constructively issues with disagreements," the statement added.
On a visit, which was first announced in February, Xin is also expected to depart from Seattle on his way to Washington to meet a number of U.S. technology leaders before continuing towards New York City and the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concern about China's alleged cyber-spying and the country's increased conditionality in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon minimizes diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown as they discussed the difference that Damon said was not needed behind the scenes.
An actor experienced in the HBO's Sunday evening Project Greenlight episode interrupted Brown as he highlighted the need for different perspectives regarding the black main character of the screenplay selected for the project.
"When we talk about diversity, it is taken into account when selecting actors for the film, not the show," Damon said.
Shocked Brown reacted with disbelief to the injured, commenting "Oh! Wow. Okay," while The Martian actor's comments were hanging in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the finalists in the series.
"I want to tell people to think, whoever the director is, how they treat Harmony's character," Brown said at the beginning.
The only dark character is the whore his white pimp beats.
The Dear White People producer demanded the rights to direct the film to finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon harshly replied that their direction "could end up giving us something we don't want."
After the discussion was posted, the social media exploded to resent Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the film clipping, writing: "Matt Damon talking to the only black person in the room and explaining to him the difference is SO WHITE that it hurts."
After its release, tweeting collected over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon's comments coincide with a time when the precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After the white police killed teenage Michael Brown in 2014, The Black Lives Matter spread nationwide and urged legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, singer Prince referred to the movement when presenting the album of the year candidates for the Grammy prize.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
The leaders of Black Lives Matter recently published a statement to answer the question of the Fox News television face Elisabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group should be considered an hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
Damon was recently told to be among the entertainers, producers and media moguls who have been invited to visit the Pope to discuss the Catholic Church's image in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or already met the Pope.
The first American Ninja Warrior champion crowned
Professional rock climber and table-gatherer Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and receive a $1 million prize as a reward.
There has never been a competitor in a competition programme that has finished its seventh season, who has survived all the points in the obstacle course of the programme.
In the final episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, survived the final round.
The last task was to climb about a 23-metre rope in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and settled the challenge in time, making him the first athlete of all time to figure out the exhausting fourth part of American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero solved the challenge three seconds faster, making him a winner.
Caldiero gave the interview to E!News after a difficult win and was still in shock about winning the $1 million grand prize.
"It's great to think of this when I've never made or lived for more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! after his big raise.
So all of a sudden... I can't even imagine what this is going to be like... the future is unknown.
Production director Kent Weed sat down to discuss the finals with The Hollywood Reporter and why Britten does not get more reward money, even though he is the first ever competitor to have managed to cross the track.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If more people pass, the one with the fastest time gets the money," Weed said.
Even though money is a great reward and changes life, he gets a great sense of satisfaction.
I don't think that's why he has a grudge.
He's just so happy that he's done what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy and a decent family man.
He is the hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If someone had to beat me, I'm happy it was Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have thought the same way if it had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior returns to the eighth season, the shoot of which will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers snuck past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The other half of the season has not been very funny for Detroit Tigers.
Tigers was once one of the best baseball teams, but is now the last in the American League Central division.
Tigers played his role perfectly on Tuesday when it won the Minnesota Twins at 5-4 Target Field.
Twins lost the opportunity to climb half-way from Houston Astros in a competition for another American League wild card spot.
For Detroit, the game was, for at least one night, a return to the six-letter "H" word, which had been very difficult to reach most of the second half of the season.
"All the winnings are fun, no matter how you get them," said Tigers team leader Brad Ausmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon continued his early offensive support when Detroit ran three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 in the inning and released three runs.
This was only his third quality in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong ending for this year," Simon said.
It's hard for a change man to pitch in every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers' replacement, Victor Martinez, hit three times and made it possible to run two runs that were his first hits since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-shot night since he hit four Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He waved the bat well," Ausmus said.
He looked good (in batting practice), looked much better in batting practice and continued the same model in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the second half of the seventh inning, and that was their best chance to get back in the game.
Centteri Byron Buxton started the inning by hitting twice on the left field line.
Aaron Hicks, on the right hand side, was settled with a one-stitch, and Simon was able to burn down second-stitch player Brian Dozier directly before Simon was replaced with left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only player who stood up to him, Miguel Sano, the first-time substitute hitter who pulled a two-chamber run to the left from right-handed Drew VerHagen.
With two runners on the field and a leveling runner on second base, VerHagen got third base Trevor Plouffe to hit the goal of a double game.
It was the record of the main series: 27th time this season when Plouffe hit a double.
After Detroit got a back-up run in the ninth, Mauer pulled two hits against Tigers' sealer Bruce Rondon, and the score was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player burned in the three pitches in his fifth rescue.
Detroit first took advantage of a rusty Phil Hughes.
Tigers got three runs in the first two innings against a right-handed veteran player who got off the list of injured persons before the game after having been away for more than a month because of lower back inflammation.
"It's obvious I didn't want this kind of start," Hughes said, "but as the game progressed, I felt more comfortable, and I felt I was able to make a few nice assists with the third inning."
After Hughes grabbed the starter to the first base, he allowed second base player Ian Kinsler to move forward one by one.
On the right-hand side, walking J.D. Martinez in two fires brought Victor Martinez to the batting shift, who took himself to first base with a midfield bat and caused the game's first run.
Victor Martinez cut his 0-21 pipe when the runners were in good running positions.
Third-baser Nick Castellanos continued to strike right and cause a second run, but the menacing situation ended when Victor Martinez was rejected in an attempt to move to third-base.
Tigers continued in the second inning and got one fire, in a two-chamber situation, from catcher James McCann and two fires, in a one-chamber situation, from Centi Anthony Gosen, after which the score was 3-0.
"It was an important hit," said Twins team leader Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but it flew to the right spot.
Hughes began to feed and fed a running third inning, and he was replaced by right-handed successor A.J. Achter.
Hughes had three runs for six hits and a walk for four fires.
ATTENTIONS: Tigers' right-handed pitcher Anibal Sanchez was thrown away because of a stretch of the shoulder of the throwing hand.
He is being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez' shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of injured persons since mid-August because of a shoulder sprain, but he had to return on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is out, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris comes from the injured list to start against Twins.
Norris' statistics on Tigers are 1-1 in four starts after left-handed pitcher David Price was traded for him on July 30.
Norris has been out since August 20, due to a right slanted abs.
Tigers and Twins will finish their three-game series on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) stands against Minnesota's right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for a wider economy to be opened up to the world
The economy needs to open up more to the outside world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told a group on Tuesday to direct the reform.
"China should commit itself to attracting foreign funding and expertise and developing transparency policy," she said at the 16th meeting of the group leading to the deepening of the general reform.
Supporting transparency at the same time as the reforms are being driven forward with more movement and vitality, and creating new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The board approved a series of guidelines, including a negative list of market access restrictions, a relaxation of border control principles, a call for state-owned companies to take advantage of private capital, and a review of the resident registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list will be created to identify those sectors and companies in which no investment is allowed.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through pilot programmes.
The change is significant because it gives the market a bigger role in allocating resources, ensures a legal business environment and makes the market more open, the opinion states.
The government also loosens control over the power it distributes to companies, ensuring that companies decide for themselves how to manage their business.
The statement also said China would allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
More sectors are opening up to private financiers to open up state-controlled sectors.
"The government will not change its policy on foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services," the statement said.
In addition, the application process for permanent resident permits for foreigners, "green cardien", will be facilitated by optimizing requirements and lightening the application process.
The meeting also discussed guaranteeing the professional rights of lawyers and supporting professional judges and prosecutors.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, also attended the meeting, were reported in a statement published after the meeting.
