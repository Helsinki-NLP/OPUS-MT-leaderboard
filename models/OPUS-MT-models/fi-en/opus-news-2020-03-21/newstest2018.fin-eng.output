Camille Auer wanted to fix her sex, diagnosed as mentally ill, and now she's doing art on the subject - "People should have a right to their own body"
There are dozens of patient stories hanging from the ceiling of the Academy of Fine Arts Project room.
Every one of them says Camille Auer's name.
The papers tell a multi-year story about how outsiders have written down their interpretation of Auer and his identity.
Decided for him who he is.
"I wanted to tell my personal treatment history to make the violence in the process visible," Auer says.
By the process, he refers to the sex correction process.
It is often a period of years that includes meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process begins with a referral to diagnosis studies of "gender identity disorder" that are conducted in Tampere and Helsinki.
For Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before that, she had used the estrogen she had ordered over the Internet and was already very advanced in her own repair process.
She felt she was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must undergo a correction process so that the gender can also be legally corrected.
Translakis, the law establishing the sex of transsek sual (563/2002), obliges transgender people to force sterilisation in order to get the right sex into, for example, a population register centre and passport.
At the moment, every sex repairer is required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and a certificate of reproductive inability.
A person has the right to decide on his own body.
"This situation is intolerable and violates human rights," Auer said.
The reform of the Translai law has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has made eight observations about the law, and the European Court of Justice has a precedent that obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect their right to self-determination.
The previous Finnish government prepared a change in the law under the leadership of the then Minister of Social Affairs and Health Susanne Huovinen.
The elections came and the Finns Party rose to the board.
Now the bill change is stuck again.
It is a question of domestic political disputes that do not even have anything to do with this law.
"The board doesn't want to put it on the table because there are disagreements within the board about changing the law," says Frank Johansson, Executive Director of Amnesty Finland's department.
The front part of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
One consists of the packaging and instructions for use of the medicines that Auer uses.
In the patient history installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of the transpol psychologist at Tampere University Hospital in Auer.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice, and based on these, wrote a report that would define Auer's right to care and help.
The sense of the reality to be studied appears vulnerable to wavering.
The studyer's perception of himself appears to be fragmented in a border-level way, and the unstable personality features are highlighted.
Auer didn't recognize himself from these descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed as mentally ill," Auer said.
The shock was even greater when Auer was not given gender correction treatment.
According to the nursing staff, his resources were not enough to start the process.
He was denied his own identity.
On 11 February 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the television in the waiting lobby of the transpol.
Later, that television created a work of art called Monument for the Exclusived, in which Auer reflected his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that any person who is defined as a woman at birth can enlarge their breasts, but a diagnosis is needed to remove the breasts," Auer says.
Your body is not yours if you feel you are anything other than the number of genders defined at birth.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not unique.
For many, the gender correction process is harder for mental reasons than for purely medical operations.
Those who go through it meet dozens of people who have to justify their own existence and their right to their own sexual experience.
"It's crazy that people who need support and help are denied treatment, arguing that their resources are not enough," Auer says.
Many of those seeking the process have psychological symptoms behind them: depression, anxiety, possible bullying experiences.
Based on these, the medical staff may order that the treatment cannot be started.
"To prevent treatment and help can put a person in an even worse situation than it was before the process started," Auer says.
Auer's personal exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
Auer writes: "I have had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life and that is something people usually find difficult to digest."
Depression has been treated with drugs, and when Auer started using hormones, it got easier.
He had finally been able to lyric the feelings that had existed already in childhood and in teens.
Why the wide jaw didn't seem to fit into its own body and why the chest muscles had to be round instead of a flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer is that there are people around him who see him.
Being seen is a basic need.
"You have to justify yourself so much by talking, dressing, using sound and moving," he says.
Today Auer already feels seen, she exists as a woman.
At the beginning of the process, however, the random comments of close people could hurt a lot.
It hurts the most when people close to you are misgroomed.
"They should know who I am, and they know who I am, but they won't or will not be able to internalize it," he continues.
But not all transhumans need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, or body conflict, where the body or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and the lengthy research process, there can be no formal confirmation of their own gender.
"There is no medical basis for these studies," Auer says.
And it's true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, Parliament approved a new procedure for the recognition of the legal sex.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination in relation to legal sex.
An adult applicant submits a written application for a new personal identity code, stating that he or she feels that he or she is of the opposite sex.
After six months of reflection, the applicant confirms his application in writing and the Ministry gives the applicant a new personal identity code.
This self-determination is also required in Finland, and the Auer exhibition also sums up this requirement.
It has not been a therapy experience for the artist, but the exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.
I want to believe that art still has weight and that it can bring about political changes, at a time when politicians have forgotten about human rights.

The Civil Rights Organisation issued a travel warning to Missouri
The National NAACP for African-American civil rights has issued a travel warning for Missouri, due to discriminatory state practices and racist attacks there.
"The NACP's Missouri travel announcement comes into effect on 28 August 2017 and calls on African-American tourists, visitors and locals to pay special attention and to exercise extreme caution when travelling to a state where there have recently been a number of questionable racial events," the organisation's statement states.
The recent law in Missouri makes it more difficult to take discrimination cases to court, and the state's law enforcement is disproportionately targeted at minorities, which, according to NACP, led to a travel warning.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They will be stopped based on skin colour and beaten or killed," Rod Chapel, president of NAACP Missouri, said to Kansas City Star.
"We've never heard of so many cases in such a short time."
The travel announcement about Missouri is the organisation's first warning about the state of the United States.
The organisation cited racist comments against African-American students at Missouri University and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year, driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel, and was arrested by Missouri police, even though he was not charged with a crime.
The travel notice also referred to Missouri's Attorney General's report that police are 75 percent more likely to stop a black driver than a white one.
"The purpose of the travel information report is to advise people to be on guard and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri," Chapel says.
"People have to prepare, for example, by including money to pay bail or by telling relatives that they are going to travel through the state."
According to the FBI, 100 hate crimes were recorded in Missouri in 2015, the sixteenth largest in the United States.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri's new law, which makes it more difficult to sue companies for discrimination in housing and employment relationships.
The ACLU organisation, which defends civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they had passed immigration laws that force the police to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to the organisation, increases racial profiling.
Usually travel warnings are published by the State Department and concern other states, but recently they have been published by non-governmental organisations in response to certain laws and trends in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair for a report on the CEO's supplementary pension
Mika Lintilä, Minister of Economic Affairs, responsible for state-owned management, has asked Finnair to report on the additional pension fee received by the airline's managing director Pekka Vauramo, Yle says.
According to the Minister, it is in conflict with the state's statement of will.
The €130,000 supplementary pension received by Vauraamo emerged this week as Helsingin Sanomat reported on the development of the remuneration of directors of listed companies.
Suomen Kuvalehti reported on Vauramo's supplementary pension in February.
Finnair said it would give up additional pensions in 2013.
The state has agreed that no additional pensions will be used to reward.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year's corporate governance policy decision.
The sanctions immediately hardened the speeches
A while ago, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia were on their way from the cold to the warm.
US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who met in connection with the G20 meeting in Hamburg, seemed to get along well.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions approved by the U.S. Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday were bitterly reacted in Russia.
The most stunning response has so far been heard from Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, who said Trump's sanction law meant "full-scale trade war."
Even if the Russian reactions were to be offset only as political rhetorical exacerbations and excesses, the tightening of the relationship between the United States and Russia is a fact after a brief honeymoon after Trump's election.
In the United States, it was not simple to pass the sanctions law against Russia, Iran and North Korea.
The Congress did, however, approve the law with a significant consensus, but the president found it much more difficult to approve the law, according to the report.
Trump has recently criticised the law he has signed as "significantly incomplete."
President Trump's grislyness must have been caused especially by Russia, even though the adoption of a law restricting his own prerogatives must have been repugnant.
As is well known, there is an investigation in the United States about Russia's possible involvement in the presidential elections as well as about Trump's Russian connections.
The tightening of the relationship between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon.
As the White House staff has changed rapidly and various scandals have been revealed to be almost up-to-date, it seems more and more obvious that foreign policy is not being conducted in the United States under the leadership of the President, but despite the President.
Such a situation is by no means desirable.
If the relationship with Russia is a kimur in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the core region of the Union in the Baltic Sea also tightens relations.
The EU has prominently highlighted the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Even though the Union has so far remained at least united in its policy towards Russia, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a member country that trades a lot with Russia like Finland, economic sanctions have been a real pain in the ass.
The effects of the recent US sanctions law are still unclear.
There has been a fear in the EU that sanctions will make it difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, for example, the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly Fennovoima nuclear power plant project can be affected.
The acidity in Europe has been caused by the exclusion of liquid natural gas in the US economy, for example, from sanctions.
Trade sanctions are a means of world politics to show disapproval.
However, economic sanctions must be well thought out and vigilant.
Otherwise, they are easily more harmful than useful.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trump's White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty
Addressing statues is the surest sign of a change of power.
Americans know it as well as others: the Iraqis, together with American soldiers, knocked down Saddam Hussein's statue in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the top ideologists in Trump's administration, was well aware of what he was doing in a heated debate with CNN channel Jim Acosta, the Statue of Liberty being attacked by Miller in an attack on the President's proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller didn't exactly criticize the statue itself.
If he had, he would have been attacked by huge numbers of cruise organisers and characters imitating the Statue of Liberty.
His attack was on the significance of the statue, especially the fact that in 1903 Emma Lazarus' poem was added to its pedestal - 17 years after the statue was completed.
Thus Miller shone at Acosta: "I don't want to go into its history now, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of the American freedom that illuminates the whole world.
The poem was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller was not wrong in itself, but it is not just history, as he himself said.
The most important are Lazarus' touching words, the only ones of their kind, where the state calls not just immigrants but "the poorest of the poor": "Your tired, your Poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to break free, / The written relief of your theme store."
The poem is now more topical than ever.
Miller did not practice literature criticism, he made it clear that the "poorest" are not welcome in Trump's United States.
The dispute about the importance of the Statue of Liberty is part of a wider political and cultural dispute about the importance of the United States.
Lazarus' friends campaigned after his death for a poem to be attached to his statue's pedestal, knowing well that the act was strongly political.
The purpose of the statue was to express the links between French and American republicanism with a classic symbol, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, the female character is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the exiles.
Linking the poem to the image was a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nationalism.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to change it back to original.
Rush Limbaugh, who can now be seen as some kind of omen of Trump, claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone, but is an early pioneer of neo-conservatives, leading the US torch into a world of darkness: "Lady Liberty steps forward.
He takes freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch does not lead the way to the United States."
Rarely, Limbaugh was partly right.
The significance of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on the perspective.
Lazarus saw it like poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants on the ship's deck after a long and trying journey.
He saw it from the point of view of people looking for shelter and better life.
His Statue of Liberty comforts by giving hope and welcoming.
And that's definitely not what Miller and Trump want.
Their torch does not lead the way, but stirs the flames of anger, their only source of power.
World Championships in Athletics 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the British national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots made the UK national team
Neil Black, the result leader of the UK athletics federation, says 16 Scottish members of the national team participating in the World Championships are "significant confirmation."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Championships in London on Friday.
According to Black, there is "something special about to happen" in Scotland, from which British athletics must learn.
"This is welcome, and we will continue to study it until we understand what is going on," Black says.
"I discussed it with representatives of the Scottish Institute of Sports, and they thought it had something to do with the Institute's activities.
Scotland's athletics federation believes it has something to do with the union's activities,
and Britain's athletics association believes that it is based on their actions.
And the average man on the street thinks he must have something to do with it.
But it's something amazing, whatever it is."
Many Scottish athletes in London are in serious competition for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in a 5,000-metre race, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen as captain of the national team.
"Eilidh is too modest.
His captain's speech was incredible," Black said.
"The athletes left the event proud of their achievements and strongly motivated, regardless of where they happened to live and train.
Eilidh's words had a genuine feeling and passion for sport."
Eilidh Doyle is a silver medalist in the 400m fence race of the Commonwealth Championships, and these are his fifth World Championships, and he thinks it is "incredible" that the national team has 16 scots.
The previous record was seven years in 1983 and 2015.
Midwayer Laura Muir has run five UK and two European records during the year.
He competes in London at 1,500 metres and 5,000 metres.
Chris O'Hare runs 1 500 metres in London, and it is worth keeping an eye on him: the man has an excellent season behind him, which includes winnings in the UK World Championships and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Championships, when the only Scottish on the national team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he is "greatly proud" that there are so many Scots involved, some of whom are seriously competing for finals and medals.
"It is already a great honour to be a captain, but it is even more special because the captain was voted by the national team members," Doyle said.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots who made the national team.
It shows how far we have come.
They are well-reputed athletes who compete for prizes.
Captain's speech?
I think it went just fine.
I was focused on how lucky we are to have a home run.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home audience and the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to compete there and I know the atmosphere will be amazing."
Blocking Critics on Facebook: Don't run for public office if you can't stand criticism
The father of our country knew what bad publicity was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began criticizing him for all possible domestic politics, always on his political principles.
Criticism must have been annoying,
But he did not silence his critics.
"If freedom of speech is removed, we may be led dumb and quiet like sheep for slaughter," Washington said in 1783.
That brings us to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff has removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked them.
The U.S. Civil Rights Union sued Hogan earlier this week.
His staff found the challenge to be unjustified, and the attitude was underestimating also online.
"What's the difference? This is just Facebook," a lot of people commented.
But it matters,
Especially in Hogan's case.
Hogan is an amazingly popular Republican governor of a Democratic state.
He has received the second best estimates of his operations among 50 governors.
Hogan is not sensitive to hotheads.
He has led the state firmly and has adhered strictly to the principles.
He has also used Facebook as the main channel of communication with his voters, and there he published a picture of a head bald in chemotherapy.
That is why blocking users entering the governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous, and the governor's website is a public and official forum that his staff maintains with tax funds.
Hogan's spokesman, Amelia Chase, defended the governor's actions in an interview with Washington Post, who said it was just about moderating comments.
But branding commentators as trolls, spammers or haters is too easy.
The Washington Post interviewed people who were blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to the leaders they chose, not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors, for example.
They said their comments were respectful, considerate and proper.
In his comment, the pastor quoted the Bible; he wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Maryland Bowie was not hostile but asked about hate crimes.
"I politely said I was disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate crimes and other recent news," he wrote in the comments on the Washington Post report.
"I also cannot accept that when more people comment on the same thing, they are immediately considered to be an organized group and ignored as a large group of concerned citizens."
The governor's staff called the comments a "focused attack", and someone else might call them a move to promote what was considered important.
In the Facebook era, communication is easy to manage by blocking a critic or removing a critical comment.
In the old days, we should have sent staff to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or arrested and silenced protesters.
But the truth is it's the same thing, now it's just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official accused of chaining Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users blocked by President Trump have sued him.
The first major decision was taken last week in Virginia.
Alexandria District Court Judge James C. Cacheris said the Loudou district government violated the first amendment of the U.S. constitution by blocking the voter on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Rights Association went to talk to Kentucky Republican Governor Matt Bevin about using Twitter and Facebook.
This shouldn't be hard.
In Washington's time, cheap postage had a similar effect to the internet today.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers hammered Washington.
Even then there were trolls.
The nicknames Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius wrote letters to newspapers calling Washington's decisions into question.
The president's office was flooded with appeals criticising Jay's contract, the US-British cooperation, trade and shipping agreement, as evidenced by the documents collected by the Papers of George Washington network project.
But he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of conversation are the foundation stones of our nation.
Real leadership means accepting this fact.
The summer feeding of birds should be stopped immediately
There have been samples from about 30 places, and also online ads about a couple, three.
Most of them have come from Southern and Southwest Finland, but then also from individual Haapavesi and Seinäjoki, says Senior Researcher Marja Isomursu from Evira.
The green peppers have died of a tricomosis parasite.
It is caused by a protozoa called Trichomonas gallinae, a scientific animal.
It has previously been known to hit pigeons, and especially pigeons.
In the 21st century, however, the disease also began to be detected in finches.
In 2009, it really hit the fan.
At that time, the tricomosis caused a big collapse in Finland's green finfish, after which the species' stocks have been on the way to recovery.
There have been sick green finches now, but not yet on a large scale, says Juha Honkala, the museum master at the University of Helsinki's Central Museum of Natural Sciences (Luomus).
The fear is that the previous epidemic of green finches will come back again, unless something is done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that everyone can do: stop feeding birds in the summer immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home court advantage at the Renaissance Club
Former European number one player Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from the home field advantage for the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in Eastern Lothian organises the 25th Scottish Senior Open tournament.
Rafferty, from Northern Ireland, led a tournament on Archerfield Links in the neighborhood last year before the final round, but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty is fond of a new place and is an ambassador for the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
"I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and this event will bring it to its full glory," Rafferty says.
"The players see the field at its best, it's in great shape.
Jerry has done a great job with this place.
He is an enthusiastic ambassador to the game, and he is proud of what he has done here.
The tournament is a great demonstration for this field."
English Eales defends the title for the first time, even though he has won both the European tour and the European challenger tour in his 32-year career.
"This feels like a really special opportunity," a player living in Southport says.
"I didn't get to defend my Extremadura Open victory because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It's great to be back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back to me: the tournament victory was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time that we will always remember."
Gary Orr is returning to action on his own soil, and he went on the tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"Playing in the home area is always more meaningful than usual," Orr says, who lives in Helensburgh.
"You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again and played quite strongly.
I'm happy with my game so far."
The trio will be joined by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The tournament will be attended by six Scots: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmair and Ross Drummond.
The car's parking costs £5 if there is only a driver in the car and £10 if there are at least two people in the car.
All proceeds will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
In Säkylä, possible indoor air problems in the barracks were solved
At Säkylä, no indoor air problems have been found in the barracks building of Pori Brigade's communications company, at least so far, the brigade was reported on Thursday.
Interior studies will continue.
The studies began when the man who interrupted his conscript service for health reasons thought his health was weakened by bad indoor air in the barracks.
According to Lieutenant Colonel Mika Holma, Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigade, there have been no problems with the health situation of other conscripts.
It turns out it was an isolated case, and there have been no health problems among the others who served in that unit.
Every announcement is taken seriously, and we wanted to get to the bottom of this.
At the moment, it is not known that we have any indoor air problem, Holma says.
The Brigade's press release says that due to the July arrival, goods had to be moved to the barracks, which may have caused the dustyness to increase temporarily.
The air may have seemed stuffy as a result," Holma says.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Gold Land
Bardina Degei does not use a stove for cooking.
Even the boiler is rarely used.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai region, located in Indonesia's restless Papua province, and when he prepares dinner, he usually puts a sweet potato - locally "not" - directly into the fireplace.
Half an hour later, the sweet potato burned to the ground will be devoured with bare, unwashed hands.
There are no furniture in Degei's home, sitting on a muddy floor, where he usually also does his daily chores, such as washing in murky water from a nearby swamp.
The toilet is provided by a bucket in a roofing room.
Degei is the youngest of her husband's four wives and has not been assigned fields to be treated.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed, and many drink a lot, and soldiers must be taken into account.
"No one dares walk in the village after five at night," Degei says.
This is a rare peek into everyday life in Papuan highlands, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969, preceded by a controversial referendum in which 1,026 villages were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed the Dutch power, quickly turned its anger on Jakarta's government, which is holding the area under strict control and preventing foreign journalists and human rights observers from entering it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is remote and crass, and the journey begins on a one-and-a-half-hour flight from the province's capital Jayapura to Nabire, and continues on a five-hour driving trip with a rental car.
There is no public transport here.
The town of about 19,000 people has wooden houses surrounded by bamboos, whose corrugated roofs have been dyed into yellow browns by rust.
Few Indonesians have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the Christian missionaries came, Papuan Mee Pago tribe worshiped the god Uga Tamee.
Other changes have also taken place.
"We didn't have clothes like this," Degei says. He means a colorful hand-woven tapering cap, a dark skirt and a brightly colored blouse.
"In the past, all we had were leaves covered in our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28 percent of its inhabitants living below the poverty line, and child mortality and illiteracy are among the highest in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's golden land.
Paniai is a highland area about the size of New Jersey, with a population of 153,000, just a hundred kilometres from Pania, the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, owned by Freeport McMoran, based in Phoenix, USA.
In 2015, the mine produced $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion in wood reserves.
For the Papuans, however, these riches bring misery, as they mean the suffocating presence of a strong Indonesian army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid local military personnel and military local units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, paying individual officers up to $150,000.
Papua's demands for greater self-determination threaten this source of income and are silenced without mercy.
According to human rights activists, since 1969 the Indonesian army has killed more than 500,000 beanmen and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Commission for Human Rights, mass killings in the highlands of Papuan tribes in the 1970s took on the proportions of genocide.
Last year the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 people in the area during peaceful demonstrations.
The report by Brisbane Archdiocese We Will Lose Everything 2016 contains stories of previous year's atrocities, such as executions without trial, torture - rape and electrocution are particularly popular methods - and ruthless attacks towards peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to calculate the number of victims because there are weekly cases," Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The screws have been tightened as Papua's natural resources attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83 percent are Christians, but the demographic structure is changing as Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawes move Muslims to the region in the hope of a better livelihood.
Java-basedwarung food stalls sell fried chicken and gado-gado vegetables in peanut sauce.
It's hard for the locals to compete.
"The movers have started selling chicken and vegetables in the market place cheaper than the locals," says 24-year-old Abeth You, who comes from Paniai and moved to the province's capital for work.
"Local women lost their customers."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo – called Jokowi – promised in his 2014 election campaign to tackle Papuan injustices and human rights violations.
Papua consists of 29 areas, and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 areas, including Paniai, on his way to the presidential castle of Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 and waited for him to fulfill our wish and restore justice," You said.
The Pania experienced some kind of wavebed just two months after Jokowi's inaugural ceremony in October.
Eleven children were singing carols at a fire in Enarotali on 7 December 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared from the dark on motorcycles.
The frightened children told the soldiers that they should use headlights.
One of the soldiers did not like the remark, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and witnesses' reports, drunken soldiers caught the children and beat them with rifles.
That's how one of the soldiers fired at the children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of assault.
A couple of hours later, the state election board building near the scene was set on fire, and the next day began to happen.
About a thousand beanmen - young men and women and children - gathered in front of a local police station and an army command centre to demand justice.
They were carrying hunting springs for the ceremony, and they began to perform the traditional Waita dance of Papuan Mee Pago, where they dance in a ring and imitate the bird song.
Some of the protesters began stoning police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere got hot, the soldiers received an order in the internal radio system: "If crowds resist more than three times, shoot them to death." The information is based on an official document that has not been released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, head of the Kego Koto area, sensed the situation was getting out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot in the left wrist," he told TIME his brightly painted wooden house on the porch.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the soldiers' ranks.
"There were multiple shots fired in the crowd."
Alfius Youwi was shot three times and his cousin saw the shootings.
"I ran to him and made sure it was really him," Yohanes told TIME, sad, and like many Indonesians, he only uses one name.
"I saw that he was dead, and I kissed him."
Papua Police Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that the police only "protected" the police station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Pudjo Sulistiyo, Papuan police spokesman, in 2015.
"That's when it's life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many were injured.
The next day, the news of the killing came to Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapura, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promising to address the violence in Papua.
"I want the case to be investigated immediately, so that nothing like this ever happens again."
Minister of Security Wiranto said in October 2016, he will launch investigations of human rights violations outside the justice system.
However, he immediately began to withdraw his words.
"Most of the violations happened a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate the violations, but it requires certain processes," he said.
In an interview for TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind, saying he wasn't going to start the investigation in Papua.
"Everything will be settled in court," he said.
The U.N. accuses Wiranto of "crimes against humanity", which involve the death of more than a thousand people in the bloody independence vote in East Timor in 1999, said to Time magazine that 11 cases of Papuan human rights violations have already been solved, including the events in Paniai.
The families of Paniai's victims view the claims with gloomy disbelief.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way," Yohanes says.
"I'm tired of this already."
He says he is still living in fear, even though it has been years since the event.
"I'm afraid," he said.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, and I'm afraid they'll shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panians are afraid to discuss the event.
He said he had been beaten by soldiers after helping bury four of the victims.
"The soldiers came after me after burying the victims," he said.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighbourhood of Paniai in Deiyai.
One died and 17 were injured in a conflict between the villagers and the head of the construction company, which began when the director refused to take the unconscious man to the hospital, including children.
The man who needed hospital care was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been on the water while fishing on a nearby river and died on the way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested at the construction site in front of the company's office.
According to the police, the villagers stoned the police who responded with warning shots.
According to locals, however, a moving police unit of Indonesian paramilitary police opened fire against the crowd, killing one of the villagers.
"We're terrified, we're afraid of revenge," said 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw wounded people being brought to treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Deiyai parliament has called for the police officers who shot the shots to be held accountable and for the mobile police unit to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development feeds discontent in the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, who live in the verdant central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Papuan Liberation Movement (OPM), an army of rebels claiming to defend the rights of the Panamans by random attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of the OPM leaders are Panias, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by arbitrarily arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Pania in the name of "safeguarding national sovereignty."
Some of those arrested will never come back.
Among the Beans, Paniai is known as "a sad, forgotten place."
Poverty feeds discontent.
There is little rice for sale in Enarotal, and that too is too expensive for the locals,
Just like the bread.
People grow their own food: mostly sweet potatoes and some fruit and leaf vegetables.
Farming is women's work, and one woman may be responsible for four or five sweet potato fields.
Most of the harvest is for the family, and the rest will be sold in the market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, differences in the livelihood of locals and migrants have grown, and the number of migrants has grown since new routes to Nabire airport were opened.
There are few jobs, and they tend to go to better trained and wealthier migrants than local residents.
Few beaners have enough capital and know how to run their own company competitively.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village because there is no work and no money," said John Gobai, president of the Paniai tribal council.
Outlying Papua will be overlooked in the world.
In addition, restrictions on international news coverage remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua, even though they had been granted a rare filming permit, and the official reason was the inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy director of Human Rights Watch in Asia, Jokowi has not kept his election promises, and has neither increased transparency nor contributed to development by removing restrictions on news coverage.
"The journalists reporting on Indonesia's most troubled eastern provinces, Papua and West Papua, have new risks: denial of visas and blacklisting," Kine said in her statement.
The lack of press freedom means that the Indonesian government is only under pressure from Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate Papua's "many and widespread violations", including the Paniai shooting scene.
These countries have also traditionally supported the Papuan Liberation Movement.
Arrmanatha Nasir, a spokesman for the Indonesian State Department, denied the accusations and told journalists in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with press freedom, so it would be difficult to cover up evidence of human rights violations."
Locals want foreign governments to intervene.
When the official Dutch delegation, led by Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May 2017, the locals broke silence and expressed their desire for freedom, says an anonymous source who attended the meeting.
There are presidential elections in Indonesia in 2019, but the beans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi anymore.
"Jokow means well, but there are people around him who are involved in Paniai's shooting," said Gobai, president of the tribal council.
He wants Jokow to know the situation of the Panics: they live under the rule of a greedy and unpredictable army in need and poverty, practically without health care and education opportunities.
According to Gobai, the Panians, like the rest of the Beans, regard their votes to Jokow as a "debt" that has to be repaid.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he said.
Despite threats and intimidation, the relatives of the victims of the Paniai shooting once more showed resistance symbolically: they buried one of the victims in a country across from the police station and the military station.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed," Yacobus said, with a head down.
"What else can we do?"
Dereck Chisora barks about the cancellation of Robert Helenius' rematch: "Even your fans don't want to see"
The heavyweight fighters Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora were scheduled to fight in Hartwall on May 27.
However, the match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, Chisora is putting the blame for completely flopping the rematch on Helenius' shoulders.
My fight in Finland failed, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
The reason was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him fight because he's miserable, Chisora is harsh.
Helenius and Chisora first met in a full Hartwall arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial score.
The ticket sales for the rematch were slow, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Ilta-Sanom in May that the match has been postponed to autumn.
Since then, there has been nothing new about the match.
However, Chisora is no longer upset about the cancellation.
The fight would probably have had to be cancelled anyway after Chisora got sick.
On Thursday, three days before the time of the match, I woke up in a lot of pain.
My tyr was about to explode.
The hospital said I should be operated on, Chisora says.
Britt says he's in about 45 percent condition at the moment.
Based on everything, he is not interested in a rematch with Helenius, but is aiming at Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a defeat of Whyte in December with a split voice.
The fire once again took over the Torch skyscraper in Dubai
The flames took over the world's tallest residential building in Dubai on Friday, and hundreds of residents had to flee from a 79-storey building 337 metres high.
This was already the second fire within two years in a building called Torch, a torch.
The building was emptied and no one is known to have been injured, and the cause of the fire had no idea immediately after the incident.
"We were asleep and woke up with a fire alarm and people's screams.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took about 10 minutes," a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai rescue services said the fire brigades were able to extinguish the fire at four o'clock in the morning and stayed to cool the building.
The government announced that it would organise accommodation for those who left their home.
The case can raise questions about the safety of high-rise materials used on exterior surfaces around the world.
After the fire in 2015, the board of the Torch building commissioned a study that found that the boards used to cover the facade and insulation were the most affected.
In the UK, police believe that London's Grenfell Tower insulation and cloaking plates could contribute to the rapid progress of flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.
A moped was stolen from a parking lot in Joensuu during the night
A moped was stolen from the Joensuu parking lot between 9 pm on Tuesday and 5 pm on Wednesday.
Mopo disappeared from Niinivaara at Tikkamäentie 2.
The moped was marked Sky Team Monkey.
It is red in colour, and the registration number is 27-REV.
The moped was found later on Thursday.
Police are asking for observations about a moped or its theft by email to this email address is protected from spambots.
You need JavaScript support to see it. or by phone to police emergency number 0295 415 320.
Modified 3.8.2017 at 12.40 a.m.: Police announced that the moped has been found.
In the United States, more than 20 percent of air passengers take prohibited items on board, reveals a survey
A survey of air passengers reveals that more than 20 per cent of passengers in the United States had deliberately or unknowingly taken banned items to planes past the TSA checkpoints, and at least six per cent of them had knives or other sharp objects they didn't know were banned.
Less than 1 percent said they had only learned afterwards that they had mistakenly carried weapons, ammunition or explosives.
More than a thousand passengers replied to the survey and was carried out by Stratos Jet Charters, and the results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to defy the rules.
19.7 per cent of passengers who knowingly violated TSA rules were representatives of the Y generation and less than 15 per cent were members of the X generation.
The rules were most often broken by taking food and liquids to the plane.
More than three per cent admitted to knowingly taking sharp objects to the plane, and 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men said they deliberately took banned drugs to the plane.
The company that carried out the survey wanted to find out how many of the smuggling items had accidentally passed the security check and how many had deliberately done so.
It is not surprising that the most travelers are also most likely to pass the security check – knowingly or unknowingly.
But, as the company that made the survey states, the TSA's instructions are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids can be taken to the plane and how much.
So it is no surprise that most of the TSA seizures are liquids.
For some time there was also a belief that books should not be taken to the plane.
Liquids can be taken on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Scott Pruitt, director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, twisted his decision to delay decisions taken during Obama's period to reduce emissions
The day after 15 states sued Scott Pruitt, head of EPA, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Pruitt withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama's smog reduction decisions.
According to Pruitt, the change shows that the agency he manages takes better account of the needs of state environmental decision-makers than previous administrations.
Pruitt did not say a word about the lawsuit against his previous decision before the Federal Appeal Court.
The states should start to comply with the 2015 level of ground ozone as of 1 October.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would postpone the implementation of the decisions by one year, so that his agency would have more time to study the plan, because the agency "does not want to interfere in local decision-making or hinder economic growth."
Pruitt was a state prosecutor in Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him head of the EPA, who is known as an opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to block or delay the implementation of decisions opposed by the chemical industry and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden change of mind is the latest setback to Pruitt's plan to ease the regulations.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the EPA director exceeded his mandate in an attempt to delay the implementation of Obama's ruling on oil and gas companies, which obliged the companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement on Wednesday evening, Pruitt argued that his reversal of the ozone rules would only strengthen EPA's cooperation with the states in a complex process aimed at meeting new requirements on schedule.
"During previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet the deadlines, and then waited for activists and others to sue it to reach an agreement on the timetables," Pruitt said. He sued the Environment Agency more than ten times in his previous action.
"We don't believe in legal regulation and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our operations and the powers it gives us."
However, the EPA opinion said that Pruitt could still use its "power to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers" to ensure that the provisions "are justified and based on the best information available."
Republicans are pushing for a broader change in the ozone regulations in Congress.
The objective of the bill adopted last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
Eric Schneiderman, a New York state prosecutor who led the EPA's state coalition that sued this week, said the group was going to continue to exert pressure.
"The EPA's change of mind as a result of our actions is a significant victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans exposed in their communities to the direct effects of the smog," Schneider said.
In addition to New York, the lawsuit included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia.
Ground-level ozone is created when emissions from, for example, cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
This smog can cause serious breathing difficulties for vulnerable groups of people, which is also part of the reason for thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists rejoiced in Pruitt's surprising change of direction.
"It's worrying how much pressure it took to make the guy in charge of our breathing air use common sense," Lori Ann Burd said from the Centre for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against Trump's regime, for its ideological goal is to act on the terms of polluters and other self-interest groups."
The supercar manufacturer is on his way to the SUV - "in Ferrari style"
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars, while at the same time trying to hold on to its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will happen in Ferrari style, CEO Sergio Marchionne said about plans at a briefing on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar manufacturer presents his new five-year plan, Automotive News reports.
All cases of East Savo measles of the same virus type
Rantasalmi measles infection is the same type of virus as East Savo's previous cases, reports THL.
The Virology Laboratory of the Department of Health and Welfare has confirmed on Thursday that East Savo's fifth measles infection is the same virus strain as previous infections.
THL has made sure that the measles infection confirmed by a beach salmiian person on Friday 28 July is of the same virus type as the previous East Savo cases.
Based on this information, all infections in East Savo are related to the first measles in the region in June.
The news is good, because it means we haven't seen any other measles virus types.
It is possible, however, that after the fifth sufferer, new infections may still appear until mid-August, and the epidemic is therefore not over, says Mirkalena Erkkilä, the doctor responsible for the infectious diseases in Soster's primary health care.
There have been no new measles infections or suspicions since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important that everyone takes care of the timeliness of their own vaccination protection, Erkkilä reminds.
More on the subject: Three new measles infections were confirmed in Pirkanmaa - "Additional infections or epidemic very unlikely"
Finland is preparing for a legitimate squealing
Pontika's soup was not even considered to be legalized.
In the background, the argument is that the process produces methanol, which is toxic in addition to alcohol.
Making a scream at home will be legal next year, but legalising a moonshine soup will not even be considered.
The scream is made by fermentation, while the moonshine is distilled.
The reason behind the distillation regulation is that the process produces methanol, which is toxic, along with alcohol.
There has been no political will to make the moonshine soup an everyman's right, commented Government Counsellor Ismo Tuominen from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the Ministry was preparing a reform of the Alcohol Act, the distillation of moonshine was not considered to be legalized.
The matter was not brought to the political table either.
There was no discussion about the release of tislaminen, said Parliamentary Representative Outi Mäkelä (Coald).
He is a member of the parliamentary groups of government parties who took a stand on the reform of the Alcohol Act.
Even on an application, you can't even grant permission to distill a moonshine in the home.
Commercial manufacturing will also remain subject to authorisation.
Importing says that the home making of alcoholic beverages becomes a simple rule: alcohol can be prepared at home by fermentation.
This means that in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can also legally make a scream at home.
The government has wanted to simplify the rules.
The new law removes requirements for flavourings and flavourings and allows the production of squealing, Mäkelä specifies.
The preparation must still take place in such a way that the ingredients, or the flavouring and flavouring ingredients that have been produced during their fermentation, are clearly visible in the drink.
According to the new law, you can make as many drinks as you want, and you can give your own alcohol as a gift.
It is still not allowed to be sold.
The act of screaming is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominen believes.
A much bigger change took place in 2004, when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75 per cent of the alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The alcohol bill is now under review by the Ministry of Justice.
The Alcohol Act will be discussed by the parliament as soon as the autumn season begins.
The plenary session is 5.9.
The law will enter into force in the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if the parliament had already taken a stand, Mäkelä rejoices.
Oscar Pistorius was rushed to hospital with armed guards escorted
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered from chest pains, was rushed to a South African hospital because of suspected heart attacks.
Pistorius has already gotten out of the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving his prison sentence in Atteridgeville prison.
According to British Mirror, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning with armed guards escorted.
Pistorius suffered chest pains, but he was released from the hospital this afternoon.
The prison spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for medical examinations.
A spokesman for the Pistorius family said the former top athlete is fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced a six-time Paralympic gold medalist to six years in jail for the murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Littered phone conversations reveal Trump had put pressure on Mexico to build a border wall
The flattening of telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders has leaked to Washington Post.
In a telephone conversation on 27 January 2017, Trump urged the Mexican President, Enrique Peña Nieto, to stop his public speech about not paying for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States blamed Nieto for having knocked out the wall project in public. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
Washington Post also published a littering about Trump's first call to Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, during which a tense exchange of words took place.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take refugees on their way to Australia is a "delicious", "stupid" and "stupid," according to Mr. Trump, a contract negotiated during Obama's term would make him look like a "ideo" because he had proposed a ban on the settlement of refugees to the United States.
Trump hung up by saying to Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant call of the whole day."
Georgia's Massacre: Activists staged racist lynching in the hope of justice
A Ford Mercury car passes a crowd in Monroe's small town in Georgia's countryside and continues its journey towards a small Moore's Ford bridge.
There are four black passengers and a white driver in the car, four armed men blocking the road before the car reaches the bridge.
The leader of the team, a middle-aged man dressed in a striped suit, takes a deep breath from his cigar and peers through the windshield.
The passengers are scared.
"Roger, n---u!" the man squirms.
"Get out of the car!"
The screams break silence when a young black man is pulled from the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is just a reenactment that was presented on 22.7.2017.
However, the sighs of shock are genuine when the noose is placed around the neck of "Roger."
Since 2005, human rights organisations have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to reenact the events of 1946, when Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has been charged with murder.
"It's confusing that no one has been arrested during these years - even though the murderers live among us and many need to know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the restructuring.
"It's a disgrace in history, but above all, it's a burden that weighs heavily on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and a former Georgia congressman.
For him, the reenactment is a startling invitation to action, and it also reminds Monroe residents that the injustice has never been corrected.
"We want those responsible to be brought to justice, and we want things finally to be settled, and we want to recover from grief and make up, but above all we want justice," Brooks says.
"We can't recover and make up until we get justice."
The coroner covers the body of the victim who died in Georgia's massacre on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI documents received from NBC news, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected of lynching.
But no one was charged with murder.
Even though the culprits have been free for decades, activists say that the motives for lynching have always been known by the locals: politics and sex.
In 1946, the Georgian state blacks were allowed to vote for the first time in the presidential election by a Supreme Court decision, and the Supreme Court issued its ruling in April, and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, there was an incident at the time of the election, in which black tenant Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner Barnett Hester in a fight apparently involving Malcom's wife Dorothy.
According to Brooks, there was a rumor in town that Hester had had an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was pregnant with her.
According to FBI information, the powerful white landowner Loy Harrison paid Malcom $600 bail on July 25, 1946, against whom he was released from prison.
On the way home, Malcom and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their car before Moore's Ford bridge.
"It has turned out Harrison ordered and organized the murders," the FBI report states.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and the local authorities, who were involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks will put it more succinctly.
"It was a right-of-vote murder," he said.
"They were murdered because they wanted to send a message to the black people that the same thing would happen to them if they were going to vote."
Cassandra Greene has been directing the reconstruction of Georgia's massacre for almost a decade.
The performance is extremely realistic and captivating, a description of the shocking racism that many would like to believe has already disappeared from the United States of America.
The show is hard to watch, but even harder not to look at what Greene said was meant to be.
"We don't want to talk about lynching, because we would have to face our own dark sides too," the director said.
"But I can't have a relationship with you if you don't hear me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
The rehearsal for this year's performance began in June, and on the first day, about 30 actors - about a dozen blacks and 20 whites - gathered to listen to Greene's routine summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's assistant director.
He has played the head of the local Ku Klux Klan for years, but the role is always as difficult and disgusting.
"I'm going to feel dirty because I'm not myself," Marbaugh says.
"It's important, however, that this side of history be held up, so that it will never happen again."
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, train their lines.
The show begins with a scene where Malcom screams and pushes Hester, furious that Hester has had an affair with Dorothy.
I said get off my property, n---u!"
Rascona, or Hester, answers.
Then there's the punch.
And then everything (at least all black actors) burst into laughter.
Greene laughs the hardest.
"What?" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Did I accidentally hit too hard?" he asks.
"No," Greene says.
"I just don't think the white people used the word n---u at the time."
"That's right," another black actor confirms.
"It's slang, you have to use a longer version."
The subject of the performance is unpleasant, but the room is dominated by a friend spirit.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just for the show, but for the memory of those who have been killed.
The scene begins again.
Now Rascona's words are breaking.
Nobody laughs.
The redeployment ends quickly and violently.
Screaming, gunshots - and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral dress stands beside the bodies and sings Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit song.
His voice breaks with every other word.
About 50 viewers a couple of ten metres away wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
Nearly half of the audience are black and half are white.
There is a couple who have come to see a show in Ithaca, New York, but most of them are local.
They have visited the victims' graves under Brooks' guidance in Georgia's oppressive humidity.
The murders have turned from a story to a reality, and the atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the song, Greene invites a crowd to check the bodies.
Children squat to watch fake blood and motionless bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy murmurs like he's reminding himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
Actressers strip their cloaks and wipe tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man who played the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then bursts into tears after a tough show.
"Don't worry," the woman in the performance comforts.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason."
Later, the audience and actors gather for a dinner together.
The white couple from Altanta are busy discussing the show with the black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski finds it hard to find words when she describes the feelings that the performance raises.
"It's hard to listen to terrible words and watch terrible things that people say and do that look like you - just because they look like you," he said.
"I was shown that lynchings are still happening," he added. "They're just called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights for listeners sitting at the same table.
He says he has already started planning next year's performance.
"Recasting is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we have experienced, but it is also an educational experience," Brooks says.
"Its message is that this can happen again if we do not learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it."
Harassing vegetables in shops makes me nervous: This much is actually saved by removing "extra parts"
Is it allowed to remove the cauliflower leaves already in the shop before weighing?
What about taking off a big hat part of pineapple - it weighs as much as it does?
The answers strongly share opinions: for one it is a sign of extreme nudity, while others do not want to pay for those parts of vegetables that they do not use and yet go home into the trash.
The phenomenon is recognized in shops.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the vegetable department of the K-Citymarket in Ruoholahti, Helsinki, because there are many who rip out the leaf parts of cauliflower, for example.
From the box, the leaves are exported to the store's biowaste.
According to the news published by the financial reports, the shopkeepers are amazed by the snorting at the vegetable counter.
But how much does removing the extra parts of vegetables before weighing really save money?
How significant is the nagging method really involved?
We Women tested how the price changes when pineapple, top artichoke, mushrooms, broccoli and cauliflower take the leaves or strains away.
Cauliflower: the price of cauliflower paying € 2.10 was 1.80 when all the leaves were peeled off.
Ananas: the price of an entire pineapple costing €2.30 dropped to €1.95 when its stock twisted away.
Latva artichoke: the price of EUR 2.60 came to EUR 2.40 when the short-term stock was cut off.
Sweet mushrooms: Two mushrooms cost a total of 75 cents.
Without stocks, the price was 60 cents.
Broccoli: The average broccoli cost 1 euro and without carrying 80 cents.
The end result: If the leaves and heels begin to pluck off, at best a few tens of centimetres will be saved for one vegetable.
In percentage terms, the price of vegetables fell by as much as 20 per cent.
A total of 1.20 euros would have been saved from these purchases!
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona - a Brazilian star signed a five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, reports AFP news agency.
Earlier on Thursday evening, Neymar's representatives had paid FC Barcelona, who played football in the Spanish league, a €222 million buyout price.
The dizzy sum of EUR 222 million is the biggest in football history.
Previously, Manchester United had a record that cost 105 million euros last summer for French Paul Pogba.
The Spanish league blocked the transfer earlier on Thursday when it rejected Neymar's first payment attempt.
The club that buys according to the league rules cannot pay the purchase price directly to the seller, but the player has to buy out his contract, which is done by recycling the money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid Neymar and his representatives who delivered the money via the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will possibly be introduced to a new home audience in the opening of the PSG season against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa examines the details
Barcelona also announced in a statement that it would provide information about the payment to the European Football Association, Uefa, so that it could determine any disciplinary action that might result from the case.
Among other things, the President of the Spanish League, Javier Tebas, has suspected that PSG's spending of money violates UEFA's rules of financial fair play.
Uefa can punish a company that will lose more than 30 million euros in three years.
According to Uefa, Neymar's transfer does not automatically violate its economic policy.
The transfer of Neymar to PSG will affect the club's economy for several years, but the impact cannot be assessed in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players for significant amounts, UEFA was announced.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a state-owned company based in Qatar.
The club is chaired by former tennis pro Nasser al-Khelaifi from Qatar.

Austin, 21, suffered severe burns from lightning strike - flash was recorded on airport security camera
Austin Dunn was doing regular work for the plane at the Lunch Florida International Airport with a couple of co-workers, when suddenly lightning struck the plane from the rainy sky.
The lightning force threw the plane to the ground of Dunn near the wing.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.
My father called me and said the brother was electrocuted and he is in the hospital.
I just asked if he was alive, Austin's sister Autumn said.
Austin spent two weeks in a hospital.
In addition to the burns, he had muscle damage and brain hemorrhage.
The experience was hard for the whole family.
You don't expect that.
It's traumatic for everyone, Autumn says.
According to an airport spokesman, the lightning risk warning system was on at the time of the incident and the transport company itself decides whether to follow it.
Pearson cuts 3,000 jobs and revives business by cutting dividends
British training group Pearson announced on Friday that it would reduce 3,000 jobs and cut the dividend by 72 per cent when starting a new restructuring programme in response to pressure on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, job cuts are mainly made at the end of 2018 and in the beginning of 2019, and the company already reduced 4,000 jobs in connection with the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced that he will cut costs again by £300 million in May as part of his third austerity programme to revive the business that is weakened as a result of rapid digitalisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell his share of Penguin Random House publishing company to his partner Bertelsmann, who announced that he would keep his outlook for the current year unchanged, with a turnover increase of 1 per cent in the first half of the year of £ 2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
The suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, where officials said the attack killed a NATO soldier and several others were wounded.
According to NATO statement, five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local information, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the Kabul Qarabagh area.
The explosion is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month, and on Tuesday 30 people were killed in an explosion in the mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people died in a suicide bomber attack at the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to a NATO statement, a Thursday night explosion occurred when a joint NATO-Afghan army patrol was the target of an attack by a "person-carrying self-made explosive device."
The statement said that all the injured were stable and were treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airport.
According to the correspondents, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organisation in Qarabagh are important concerns for NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20 per cent of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul in an area where there are mainly Shiia Muslims.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people were killed in a bomb attack in central Kabul, the country's most devastating militant group attack since the US-led forces overthrowing the Taliban in 2001.
The violence highlights the unstable situation in Afghanistan, when President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States will send more troops to help the local army and police.
According to correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly weakened people's confidence in the government, its politics, and especially President Ashraf Ghan.
EPA turns its decision to postpone the implementation of smog regulations
The U.S. EPA reversed its decision to delay the implementation of decisions taken during Obama's administration to reduce smog emissions one day after 15 states had sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the so-called "otson definitions" in 2015 late on Wednesday, which, according to the Agency, is a sign of its commitment to cooperation with the Länder.
"We believe in dialogue and want to meet the needs of the states," said Scott Pruitt, director of the agency's statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the Agency's intention to postpone the implementation of ozone definitions by one year to October 2018, which states that smog pollution will be measured in certain parts of the country in order to determine where pollutants need to be reduced in accordance with more stringent air quality standards.
On Tuesday, the agency sued 15 mainly Democratic-controlled states, including the District of Columbia, saying it was illegal to postpone execution.
President Donald Trump's administration has been looking for ways to ease the environmental regulations of Barack Obama's era, according to Trump as part of a broader agenda for economic growth.
Trump's actions have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of the increase in emissions.
According to EPA website, breathing ozone-containing air "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, one of the leading figures in ISIS had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
According to suspicions, the bomb was to be taken to the plane on July 15, but the company was interrupted before the security check.
Police are not going to give any details as to why the company was interrupted.
Another of the suspected terrorists' plans was to build a device to secrete toxic colourless gas and take it to a crowded public place, such as a public transport.
Deputy Australian Federal Commissioner Michael Phelan said that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Based on suspected terrorist plans, four men were apprehended during police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations will also continue.
Neste's CEO: Renewable fuels did well
The oil processor Neste's profit before taxes fell, but beat the forecasts in the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievonen, the company made a good result in oil products, the sales volumes of renewable products reached record levels, and the business profit of the Marketing & Services segment was moving in the right direction.
Last year's comparable operating profit was improved by the US Blenders Tax Credit tax relief.
According to Lievonen, the operating profit of renewable products remained at a good level this year, thanks to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects, and we will finish the strategic investments we announced earlier in 2017, said Lievonen in a press release.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko discuss a possible match in their first meeting
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match in the near future for a series of under 66.7 kilos, met for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms on ESPN sports channel in Los Angeles, until WBC's unbeatable lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked down the aisle to greet Lomachenko, WBO's master of the upper feather series.
On Saturday, Garcia won the former four-weight world champion Adrie Broner with a unanimous decision, after which Garcia and Lomachenko have been among the top five boxers of different weight classes on a comparative list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and asked, "What's up, champ?
Good luck in the match!"
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN at seven on Saturday.
When the two posed to photographers, Lomachenko's manager, Egis Klimas, pointed out that the match between men would be "perfect in terms of size."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded me.
"I moved up the series for Broner [63.5 kilos], but I'm not that big.
I'm small to 63.5 kilos.
I want to go back to the lightweight show.
He has to go to a lightweight [61.2 kilos] and then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Let's fulfill their wishes."
Lomachenko agreed.
Boxing needs this fight.
Klimas asked whether the match should be organised on a pay-per-view channel, part of his strategy for Lomachenko to debut later this year in the lightweight series and to fight Garcia (37-0, 30 knockout wins) next summer. Garcia would also be interested in facing the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will be fighting in the lightweight Forum on September 23.
"The match could be on pay-per-view, because fans have asked for it," Garcia said and later announced he was ready to fight on a channel that offers the best prize package.
"We are the most interesting names.
No one else attracts as much attention.
As soon as we reach an agreement, I'll be fine.
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as a "infidel fighter" and that he might be going to see Saturday's match.
Lomachenko stopped praising Garcia's run and said that this three-weight champion from Riverside looked "very slow. Sorry, Mike... but you needed that knockout."
Garcia said he focused first on showing the punch force and then boxing.
The men said they felt they wanted the fight between them to take place even more strongly.
"This is the fight we're waiting for.
No other match attracts as much attention and interest.
I'm definitely involved in this case," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said he was expecting to fight the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It's going to be a great fight."
Average salary 5 300 euros, training what happens - investment advice situation was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has spoken a lot lately.
Last time Helsingin Sanomat told about Ritva, 68, to whom the banker's investment advisor spoke full nonsense when selling investment products.
The rules for investment advisors and various sales of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
The tightening is based on the new MiFID, which will be applied from the beginning of next year.
At present, the assessment of the skills of investment advisors and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
There are no skills requirements defined in the Act.
The financial sector (FA) itself recommends that those who work in investment services complete their own APV1 or APV2 degrees.
The financial industry has authorized the organisation of the qualifications for APV Investment Qualifications Ltd, which has experts from both Financial Supervisory Authority (Fiva), universities and industry.
The degrees are 12-15 credits, and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE, which is Aalto University Executive Education Oy, which provides management development services.
Its website says that in general both exams are "very extensive in terms of requirements".
The study material of the qualifications includes 10-15 books, as well as a number of other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV Investment Qualifications Ltd, says that the pass percentage of exams is roughly about 70.
About the staff of the largest banks, all those offering investment services have completed either APV1 or APV2, because they are mandatory according to the company's own rules.
Then there are smaller bankers without mentioning names whose staff seems to have avoided completing their qualifications, Savikko says.
According to him, there are "a few" bankers like this.
According to Savigo, the APV1 degree has been completed since 2000 by 13,000 to 14,000 people and more demanding APV2 qualifications recommended to investment advisors by some 3,000 people.
Some bankers feel that it is an advantage to complete a degree.
Several other industries have considerably stricter skills requirements.
Savikko says that the recommendation from the Financial Services sector requires APV qualifications to be completed, because it is then that the investment sector competence will be ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisors earn on average several thousand euros per month, including commissions, benefits in kind and earnings bonuses.
The average earnings of regular working hours for monthly employees are about 5,300 euros.
On average, men working in jobs earn over 5,900 euros a month, and women earn over 4,500 euros a month.
On average, the tithe of those making the most money earn about 8 100 euros.
The tithe of men making the most money earns more than 9,000 euros a month or more, one tenth of women making the most money makes 6,400 euros or more.
Investment advice according to the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
So far, there has been confidence in self-regulation at employee and task level.
According to Fiva, individual cases were encountered during its inspection, in which the investment advisor's competence and competence were not sufficient based on the counsel's actions.
In principle, you can also sell investment products, even if your skills and qualifications are at a mild level.
Basically, the situation has been wild and free in this regard.
Several other industries have considerably stricter skills requirements, Savikko says.
According to Savigo, from the beginning of next year, this will be tightened with the new MiFID II.
It requires each company to be responsible for ensuring that the staff providing investment services are sufficiently skilled.
Financial supervision, on the other hand, will probably have the power to determine what to do.
The market supervisor of Fiva, Marko Hovi, says that one of the clear changes to the current situation is the regulation of the requirements for the skills and experience of investment advisors and sellers of investment products.
According to the Court, the new requirements apply both to investment firms' own staff and tied agents selling products on behalf of a company.
The Hovi says that according to a government proposal from the Ministry of Finance, Fiva is likely to have the authority to determine competence and experience.
What they are exactly will be decided on in this outlook during the coming autumn.
The company must continue to provide the necessary training and, if necessary, follow-up and further training.
All of this must be documented, and the company has a duty of proof about this, that this has also been done.
The Court states that in practice the company must, for example, map the staff's positions at individual level.
There will certainly be different standards depending on whether it is investment advice or the sale of products.
According to the Court, there is also a requirement to work with someone more experienced than the deadline, if the level of competence or experience is not sufficient.
In other words, if the company hires a new employee who does not quite meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person who meets the criteria for a certain time.
According to the Court, the change will tighten the rules and make them more concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will become stricter in the beginning of 2018.
Photo: 787 Dreamliner "drawing" a giant plane over the United States
The route flown by the plane was drawn over the United States in the Flightradar24 service.
The flight was carried out on Thursday 787 on a Dreamliner, using which Boeing tested the durability of the aircraft's Rolls Royce engines on a long flight.
The plane leaving Seattle flew a distance of 15,700 kilometres in 18 hours and 1 minute, longer than any regular commercial scheduled flight in the world.
The flight stayed within U.S. borders throughout the journey.
It flew through 17 states in total.
Imatra's tenacious beach swimmers won't be hit by rain or sunburn - Iines Kaikkonen trotted persistently with the help of the swimhouse village
Iines Kaikkonen made good progress, Taina Itkonen followed.
Imatra beach swimming schools will run in Liette and Lempukka this week and next week.
Even though it rains sometimes and then shines again, young swimmers are not bad at all, Taina Itkonen, the swim school leader, says.
In this week's swimming schools, a total of 13 children will increase their swimming skills, around a dozen next week.
The number of children in the coming week was affected by the fact that the school and the professor will begin then, Itkonen estimates.
The beach swimming school of Imatra is organised jointly by the "Sleep together" project and the city of Imatra.
On Thursday, Liete beach had a nice atmosphere.
The sun was shining and young swimmers were training to stay on the surface with the swimming tables, someone without them.
The smaller siblings also enjoyed the water.
Iines from Kaikko, 5, first suspected going deeper into the water.
However, Taina Itkonen encouraged him to hit the beach.
You're doing great!
Iines Kaikkonen said she had been swimming a lot this summer.
She thinks the beach is a good one.
Like Iines Kaikkonen, swimming with the swimming tables village was persistently practiced by Vili Huhtanen, 5.
You, too, will be pleased with today's achievements, the swim teacher praised.
Jami Kallio, 4, once in a while wanted to go to the water war.
Ilona Villberg, who followed her daughter Anna Villberg, 6 from the beach, sees the beach swimming school as a good start for swimming.
No matter what the weather may have been, Anna has liked to go here every day.
Sometimes you had to warm up.
The swim school students packed up on the pier.
The boys were busy with a frog found on the beach.
Milja Lukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels on the pier, snacking fruit and frying the day.
The education already continued in the water, but there was no hurry at the pier.
That's what happens when you don't belong in the summer.
An unknown soldier sells toilet brushes - "Here's a story that connects."
You can see all kinds of things.
Sinituote, a cleaning product manufacturer, launched a series of Unknown Soldier products a couple of days ago.
I mean, dish brushes and laundry racks and a "wc brush on the edge of the brush."
In these autumn, an unknown soldier refers to the premiere of the film and the marketing of the film.
Yet there is something special about the combination, and the products have been insulted on social media: When will the Unknown health ties come?
I have to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does Aino Määttä, vice president of Sinituote, say?
We're the film's partner.
We are supporting this film, like many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and a cult film, Määttä says.
According to him, there will be special performances for the products, which will give the film visibility.
Isn't there something a bit funny about this - often when you think that the products and the stories connected to them have something in common?
Yes, there is a story that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products, Määttä says.
According to him, the company supports the same basic Finnish values that are supported by those who have seen the old Unknown Soldier.
And cleaning is not foreign to military culture either, Määttä points out.
Other business partners in the Unknown Soldier film include, for example, Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
So far, for example, Hartwall's vichys have been launched, which are called Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unknown products were already made by Kalle Kinnunen, blogger of Suomen Kuvalehti
Coffee and clocks are already available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the premiere of the film, so there is still a way forward.
For example, Valio, the Refiner, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl have not revealed their war products yet.
The new results of the Swedish asylum seekers' age tests were announced
The latest results of the Swedish asylum seekers' medical age tests have been released, and the results of the new evaluation method reveal that over 80 per cent of those tested were found to be over 18 years old, but not everyone thinks the tests are reliable.
The Swedish National Bureau of Legal Medicine began testing earlier this year.
The tests can be used to assess the asylum seeker's age more closely, and a new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was criticised for failing to identify the actual age of applicants claiming to be minors.
The Finnish Immigration Service has carried out 6,880 tests so far, and the forensics office has now released the results of 2,481 tests, which were carried out between mid-March and the end of July 2017.
Eighty per cent of those tested, i.e. in 2002, the asylum seeker was determined to be over 18 years old, and in 25 cases, the Department of Law Medicine determined that the test was "possibly 18 years old or older."
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker is "possibly under 18 years old".
The tests were carried out only in cases where there was reason to doubt the age indicated by the applicant.
Johan Göransson from the Department of Law Medicine says that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The numbers are quite uniform, and there are no significant differences in the statistics of the previous months," he told The Local.
While most of the applicants were determined to be over 18, that does not necessarily mean that the applicants lied about their age.
In May, the agency released the results of the 581 tests and reported that 442 cases had "refers to the fact that the study is 18 years old or older."
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it turned out that in 243 cases the applicant had openly told that he was turning 18 this year.
The medical age assessment method used in the tests takes X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRIs of knee joints, then the images are analysed by dentists and radiologists, and the method has also been criticised.
One of the sceptics is Karolininen Institute's endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing people's biological maturity, which can be used to determine whether a person has entered puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I think the method used is not the right one.
The definition of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't determine the age for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can," he said to Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson, a forensics agency, defended the accuracy of the tests: "It is common to say that the risk of determining a child as an adult is small.
The risk is the greatest in a situation where the test is about to turn 18, and the risk is about 10 per cent."
Ilonen collapsed 30 places in Scotland
Five over par results in the third round spent 30 points of Mikko Ilona on a score strip downwards in the European golf tour competition in Scotland.
Ilonen left in 11th place on Saturday, but was found at the end of the tour to split 41.
In the difficult weather, Iloinen was joined by three bogs with one double bog.
The others were having trouble, too.
Ian Poulter, an Englishman, rose to share one of the top positions in the under-par round, even though he said there was enough work to hold the umbrella.
Keli was brutal, but I hung along and eventually it was a good day, Poulter thought.
He shares the lead with his countryman Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
West Virginia Governor Changes Party
Democratic governor Jim Justice of West Virginia announced on Thursday night at Trump's campaign event that he would change parties.
"Democrats simply abandoned me," Justice said.
"Today I can tell you after many prayers and thorough reflections... "Today I tell the West Virginians that I can no longer help you as the Democratic governor."
The crowd burst into loud applause.
"Tomorrow as a member of a registered Republican Party," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time for a new game."
Trump promised earlier that a significant announcement would be made at the campaign event in West Virginia.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia because Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016, and Forbes said he is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited a mining company from his father and owns coal mines in five states.
His fortune is worth about $1.59 billion.
The National Committee of Republicans (RNC) published a statement on Thursday evening that "the change of governor Justice is yet another blow to a democratic party that prefers to build obstacles rather than better America."
"Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before, and in this situation Justice's announcement is the latest setback for a party that has no leadership whatsoever and is unable to find a positive message that unites people," Ronna McDaniel, a representative of the RNC, said in a statement to CBS news.
Lightnings sow damage - Thursday will even be the most thunderstorming day of the summer
At the end of the week, there will also be more thunderstorms in Southern Finland.
During the past week, thunder has thundered especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Southwest Finland.
On the night between Wednesday and Thursday, lightning struck several fires.
According to a meteorologist, Thursday may be the most thunderstorm day of the summer to date.
The thunderstorms have finally found Finland, too.
During the past week, lightning has been especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Southwest Finland.
On the pud, lightning hit the power centre of the terraced house, causing a small fire.
The rescue department was notified of the fire about 15 minutes until midnight on Wednesday.
The electricity centre was located at the end of the terraced house in the sauna room.
The rescue department dismantled the roof and wall to find the fires and quickly extinguished the fire.
Eleven homes were left without electricity, but personal damage was avoided.
In Loimaa, lightning set fire to the outside building on Harjulantie before midnight.
When the rescue department arrived, the building was already at full fire, and the rescue department could only stop the fire from spreading.
An outdoor building, about 50 square metres in size, burned to the ground.
In the direction of Kuopio, in Rääkkylä, lightning struck a detached house.
The residents of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flashing lightning strike.
The rescue department was there to check on the incident, but this time lightning did not cause a fire - just a few fuses burned.
In traffic, thunder caused problems on the train track between Seinäjoki and Vaasa when the lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
The information about the fault was received between 8 and 9 a.m. on Thursday morning, after which trains were replaced by buses during that period.
The problem was only fixed shortly before five in the afternoon.
Since then, train traffic has also been able to continue normally in the thunderstormed section of the track.
The lightnings have sowed destruction in different parts of Finland.
However, the lightning has been relatively low this summer.
This summer's thunderstorms have been a disaster! estimates meteorologist Jari Tuovinen, who is on call at the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
The thunderstorms on Wednesday and Thursday have been mainly moderate in intensity, but thanks to the low lightning balance during the summer it also feels strong for many.
This might feel really thunderstormy, but that's what it's been like compared to the thunderstorms this summer, says Tuovinen.
On Wednesday, there were 1,700 skimmers, and Thursday has had potential even for the worst thunderstorm day of the summer: by about 4:00 pm, there were 1,790 salamas on the floor.
If the lightning continues to the beginning of the evening, more than 2,000 lightnings can be reached, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record-weak thunderstorm year was experienced in 2015, when the number of lightnings in the year was about 30,000.
By Wednesday, this year's lightning rate had risen to 18,386 salamas.
So there is still something to catch, so that this year does not break the record of two years ago.
However, you can expect the thunderskir to continue.
According to Tuovinen, air mass over Finland will also remain warm and wet in the end of the week, which is an acceptable source environment for thunderstorms.
The main focus of thunderstorms is expected to move south from the northern parts of the country to Saturday, where about 2,000 days of lightning can be obtained both on Saturday and Sunday.
A more united rain front is expected for the centre of the country.
According to Tuovinen, there are few thunderstorms in such places.
Coe praises Russia's "open-minded" apology for the doping scandal
World athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised the apology he described as open-minded, which Russia made on Thursday because of the doping scandal, but Mr Coe added that it was not yet time to put an end to Russia's ban on participation.
Russia's athletics director Dmitri Shlyahtin said at the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships on Thursday that the Russian ban is correct and that he is determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry "for all the athletes who were robbed of a gold or silver medal in the competitions."
Despite his comment, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of continuing the ban, and Russia was excluded from athletics in November 2015 after evidence of state-supported doping in Russia had been presented in the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA report.
"I think his answer today was very direct, and it was a very open-minded presentation," IAAF president Coe told the reporters.
"The whole council and Congress were pleased that the Russian athletics federation admitted that the country had gone through difficult times and said it would do everything in its power to reorganize its operations."
Mr Coe also said he was "satisfied" with Russia's acceptance of the conditions for ending the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the group's recommendation that this is not the time to end the Russian ban," Coe said.
"In the coming months, we will have to do everything we can to normalise the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from a corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes compete with neutral athlete status in the World Championships in London on Friday, which have met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF task force, said on Monday that Russia still has to meet a number of requirements before its status can be restored.
"The testing is still inadequate, and the coaches who were banned still operate freely," he told the reporters on Friday after a presentation to the IAAF Council in London.
Production company disappointed with the poor success of Tom of Finland
Tom of Finland didn't turn out to be the success the authors wanted, says Yle.
To be honest, I'm disappointed, confessing that the film was produced by Helsinki Film's CEO Annika Sucksdorff in an interview with Yle.
I feared that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film was premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached over 100,000 viewers, which is less than the film budget, about five million euros.
This didn't win the lottery, but it's important now that investors get theirs back.
If the film had been more successful in their home country, they would have had their money already.
Now we have to wait for small brooks of foreign distributions, Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoski.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's transfer to Paris
The regulations restricting the use of money by European football clubs do not prevent Neymar's transfer from Barcelona in Spain to Paris Saint-Germain in France, the most expensive player transfer ever made in football.
Its possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by UEFA, which regulates European football, which can prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
UEFA introduced fair-play economic rules in 2011, according to which PSG must be able to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer has been financed without major losses.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million to close the Brazilian contract, and Neymar's annual salary in the new club is in tens of millions of dollars.
There are many economic aspects to Neymar's transfer to France.
PSG has no difficulty in paying Neymar's transfer money and linking him to its starguard, as the company finances a dynasty rich in Qatar's oil.
Clubs are allowed to spend large sums of money on acquiring players, but they need to be balanced with real income, so that the football-related business is not loss-making.
The economic rules of fair play were drawn up on the initiative of French Michel Platin, who was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini felt that the pursuit of success by indebtedness was cheating and led to serious problems if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the focus of fair play financial rules shifted from clubs' debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that Roman Abramovich's first business model in Chelsea in 2003 became significantly more difficult to implement, with Abramovich buying a promising team, spending huge sums on player acquisitions and creating a global brand.
The current three-year review period of fair play economic rules will last until 2018, during which clubs will be allowed to make a maximum loss of EUR 30 million.
Even though Platini had to leave UEFA president in a scandalous way in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, also wants to curb the reckless spending of the clubs.
"The rules of fair play are still in place, and we will also apply them in the future," Andrea Traverso, who was responsible for fair play financial rules in UEFA, told the Associated Press last week.
Even though PSG paid Neymar out of its contract with a lump sum, it can hold the amount in the accounts for the whole duration of his new contract.
Neymar has made a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be recorded as a €44.4 million per year for the next five years.
Based on the economic rules of fair play, the first sanctions were distributed in 2014. The biggest sanctions were passed on to PSG and Manchester City, funded by Abu Dhabi.
PSG received a €60 million fine, later reduced to €20 million, and the club was ordered to limit its Champions League team to 21 players for the 2014-2015 season instead of the normal 25 players.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their income through companies that join the club's owners.
For example, if a Qatari company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be above the normal market level, UEFA will not count the aid as the actual result.
This happened when UEFA decided in 2014 that Qatar's support for PSG was oversized.
It has also come to light that some of Neymar's earnings in PSG could be financed by the fees paid by Qatar from the 2022 World Championship Organization Commission.
However, PSG and the Organizations Committee have denied that Neymar would be made ambassador to the World Championships, and it would be very easy for UEFA to reveal such an arrangement.
Because of PSG's previous sanctions, UEFA will follow even more closely the attempts to circumvent the rules.
On Thursday, the available sources said that UEFA has not negotiated with PSG about the transfer of Neymar.
The sources gave an interview to the Associated Press news agency on the condition that their identity is not revealed because they are not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG's net sales for the period 2015-2016 were 542.4 million euros and operating profit was over 10 million euros.
Last season's financial statements have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to attract new sponsors and increase sales of club products and jerseys.
The club estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30 per cent with Neymar's contract.
The Spanish League, which was clearly irritated by the departure of one of the best players in the world, tried to make the transfer of Neymar more difficult, allegedly breaking the financial rules of fair play.
"This is a clear economic doping case for both the club and the state," Javier Tebas, president of the Spanish League, said to the Spanish AS newspaper, referring to the quataric ownership of PSG.
Arsenal's manager, Arsene Wenger, also has reservations about the state's funding of the football club, which is owned by an American sports tycoon.
"The incident is the result of ownership that has completely changed the football environment in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Everything is possible after the state owns the football team.
It will be very difficult to follow the financial rules of fair play, and there are so many interests involved in the fact that the famous player represents the state."
We are now in a hurry: Finnish World Championship athletes coach stuck in Helsinki
Long jumper Arttu Pajulahti and three-steper Kristiina Mäkelä's coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, even though he should be coaching at the athletics World Championships in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
Pajulahti will compete in the long jump qualifier tomorrow, and Mäkelä will compete in the triple leap qualifier on Saturday.
However, the double coach, Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa for the UK.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with the matter in a British broadcast without success.
The coach has the invitation of the World Championship organisers as a documentary, but also has not been enough to get a visa.
I wonder if this is one of Brexit's first symptoms, or what, coach manager Jorma Kemppainen said.
He has always handled visa matters successfully before, but now there are some problems.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for SUL for years.
It doesn't matter that much.
As long as someone in the stadium looks at the stepmarks, Arttu Pajulahti said his coach could be left behind.
The World Championship Medal for Finland from London calls for a miracle
Athletics World Championships will begin in London today on Friday and will last a good week, ending on Sunday, August 13.
Athletics, cross-country skiing and hockey are the kind of sport that Finnish bench athletes can be passionate about year after year, whether they are successful or not.
In the hearts of bench athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course there are other indicators.
Less attention will be paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one prize to another, in which the experience will mature the athlete's performance to the level that the adult World Championship is genuinely possible.
Now there are no such young athletes in Finland's small World Championship team, but there are no conscripts either.
The World Championship medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the attraction and surprise of sport is that miracles can happen.
It draws the bench athletes to the television screen and glues them to watch the games, even though the London medals are not settled until late in the evening because of the time difference.
From the previous World Championships in athletics 2015 Finland received one bronze medal.
It was brought by spear thrower Tero Pitkämäki.
The darers expect a medal from Pitkämäki even now, even though the results of recent events by him and the other shooters and the fact that Pitkämäki was left in the qualifiers last summer.
Whatever happened to these games, Pitkämäki will be a great Finnish sports hero in history.
For other Finnish athletes in the competition, getting to the finals or making their own record is a good enough performance.
Hope and faith in the realistic medal hunt for Finland's athletics in the coming years will be a great success in the youth's international championships also this summer.
Processing the talents of young people and supporting their work financially is more important than maintaining a small elite group of professional athletes.
Success does not come in an instant but requires years of sweat from athletes and patience from both coaching and bench athletes.
Finns are also able to appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
Hopefully the London Games will remain in the history of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not because of, for example, terrorist intimidation or cowardly attacks.
Enni Rukajärvi, second in Copper's big air - "But yes, I'm sorry"
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi is second in the big air race in Colorado, USA.
Copper Mountain's second place is Rukajärvi's best big air in the world cup.
The women's race was won by American Jamie Anderson.
Rukajärvi collected 147 points in the competition.
With his last jump, he tried the caballerial 1080 for the first time in the games, and that was very close to succeeding.
Feeling good and feeling good now, but I'm sorry the last jump didn't go quite well.
From now on, I'm going to try it again in the games, Rukajärvi thought.
In the big air of snowboarding, the competitor jumps from a jump made for the sport.
Viking Line's new express ship froze to port in Helsinki
The shipping company Viking's new fast ship FSTR is very late on schedule.
The express ship was supposed to leave Helsinki for Tallinn at 6 pm.
The ship was loaded around eight o'clock.
The ship arrived already late in Helsinki.
At least an hour and a half I've been waiting to get on board.
Now the car queue is moving a bit, Johannes Rebane, an Estonian waiting to board in Helsinki harbour, said at 7.30 pm.
Rebane thought there had been a technical fault with the new ship.
Rebane said that the shipping company had brought water bottles to those waiting in their cars.
Viking Communications Manager Christa Grönlund says to IS that there was a technical fault on the side.
It was repaired in Helsinki harbour.
The ship leaves Helsinki a couple of hours late.
Grönlund says the ship will also be late for Tallinn's return trip for a couple of hours.
The ship was to leave Tallinn to return to Helsinki at 8:15 p.m.
A 42-metre special transport disrupts traffic on Six Street on Thursday night
A 42-metre-long special transport will move from Muuko to Mustola harbour during Thursday evening.
The transport leaving at nine o'clock should be there by 11 p.m.
Police are directing traffic on Six Street, and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
At the point of Mälkä, the transport progresses along route 13 to the port of Mustola.
Small circle nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
At the same time, the story is yearning for both the '80s glory days and the '90s grunge (about that time, David Wain and Michael Showalter did a great series of The State sketches for MTV) and their own time - 2001 before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars in the series moved on to bigger stories.
As a cultural product, it is both parody and a description of the constant recollection that we are stuck in during the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it seems to have lived for a while.
The First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humour (for example, the background story of H. Jon Benjamin speaking in a can of vegetables).
The point of the joke is that middle-aged actors act as horny teenagers who approach maturity, and highlighting it makes the impossible of reaching the past part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults act as adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: for example, it parodiates stalker movies from the '90s, such as the horror movie Hand rocking the cradle.
One of the characters digs up Apple Powerbook, inline roller skates and "other stuff from 1991."
Many of the stories are the same as before.
Good-hearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And one crazy plot involves Ronald Reagan (so-called Michael Showalter) as his accomplice, George H.W. Bush (who is aptly played by Michael Ian Black).
As always in such series, the best are side paths.
It's especially funny to see a young man named Paul Rudd, who has a beard bump under his lower lip, or Matt Dillon's "soul patch" from Singles.
The moments of random madness may take this series to flight as a sort of recursive Seven Up! series until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. In its final scene, a group of friends will go to the premiere of Wet Hot American Summer.
Amazon's Comrade Detective series appeals to another kind of nostalgia: The Americans' Cold War spirit, Atomic Blonde film, and even the GLOW series wrestling catalog, where the East meets the West.
The comedy series has been created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, directed by Rhys Thomas, a Romanian police drama in the 1980s, where a police couple from Bucharest fight for truth, atheism and Marxism-Leninism.
In the lead, the tough Gregor and idealistic Iosef are Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici, whose lines have been dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
But it's not much else.
There are some good visual jokes in the show (police spend time watching chess on TV the same way the Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous sound actors involved, including Jenny Slate, Nick Oferman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny, and their bong is a fun game.
However, the Comrade Detective gets too caught up in the imitation of clumsy socialist drama - for example, there is a killer hiding behind a Reagan mask, which is why the show often begins to feel like clumsy propaganda.
Six long episodes are too long, and the humor of the series is neither fast enough nor rich enough.
In a nutshell, the series could work better as agitprop satir, for example, when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy and there are always two fat men in the lobby eating burgers.
A message to an imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can turn everything into consumer goods and fast food.
The fictional Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: we were numbing our recent history and their history.
Kouvola-based Toni Tauru rises to the ring in Macao on Saturday - against a former UFC fighter
Toni Tauru wants to keep the fight going.
Toni Tauru has a hard bone against him in Macau, because Leandro Issa, a Brazilian, was still fighting in the UFC organisation last year.
The Brazilian also has the black belt of jujutsu and the world championship of the sport.
For once, I'm fighting myself against a parent.
It's funny, says 32-year-old Tauru.
Kouvolalainen was supposed to rise to the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three battles were made on a quick schedule to China's autonomous area of Macao.
The Tauru has never faced such a thing before.
This was the first time my fight was cancelled.
It was annoying, because preparation and training took a lot of time.
The fighter is pleased, however, that a new date was reached for the struggle.
A week's waiting doesn't really affect the preparation.
The transfer will not affect the condition, as it will not improve in a week.
The condition can get worse if you practice too much now.
In the last few battles, Tauru has faced opponents whose strengths are in fighting.
This time the situation is different.
Issaa Kouvolalainen describes as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
I bet he comes hard in the first round and tries to take it to the carpet.
He has won the Jujutsu World Championship, so he can wrestle.
Kouvolalainen's last match did not go according to plan.
Kevin Belingon, a Filipino, hit Tauru badly in the corner of the eye, and the victory was left in the Philippines.
I've never fought so well, especially standing: he didn't get any hits.
When I went down, he hit my eyebrow.
It was a real pain in the ass for a long time.
New motivation
Some of the free fighters fight once a year, some rise more frequently in the ring.
For example, the future opponent Issa fought last time in September.
Tauru, on the other hand, had three matches last year.
Now the second battle of this year is ahead.
Sometimes the pace has become heavy.
In recent years, I have been training and in good condition the whole time.
But the only reason I've been fighting is because of the fight.
When the 32-year-old heard about the coming encounter, he decided to change the landscape for a while.
I was training in Espoo and got the joy of doing it back.
We got really good training when there was a guy from Sweden with us.
The training was a great help, since on Saturday a Kouvolan will have to prepare for a physical struggle.
I have been allowed to train against opponents of the same size and to practice a vertical match.
Fighting upright is the main tactic of a 32-year-old.
You have to strike rationally.
If there's an opportunity, I'll take myself to the property.
You can't give down for free, because they consume the most.
Macau attracts Tauru, who had fought in China before.
They say it's China's Las Vegas.
I think there's a big, great evening in front of you.
The Bank of England keeps interest at 0.25 per cent
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates unchanged after the economic growth has been impotent and inflation has stopped speculation about interest rates.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be slow, and the Bank has moved interest rates because of the increasing pressure on families' income levels.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank's Monetary Policy Commission decided by 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25 per cent, which received less support this month because economic growth has been impotent.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank dropped its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and its forecast for 2018 to 1.6%, and warned that households' income levels would be under even more pressure as inflation is expected to continue to accelerate close to three per cent in the autumn.
However, according to the bank, interest rates will be needed in the next few years to curb the inflation rate driven by Brexit, and the bank also announced that loan costs could have to be increased more than expected in the financial markets.
In addition, the members of the committee decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package that began a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will close the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, even though it is now expected to provide £15 million more to the banks, a total of £115 million, to provide affordable funding through the programme.
The Bank's interest rate decision protocol states: "There is a forecast from the Commission for Monetary Policy that the slow development of GDP will continue in the coming years as households' real income declines in consumption."
With regard to interest rates, the bank reiterated the need for "a degree of tightening of monetary policy" to curb inflation, and the expectations of the market "a bit wider."
The market currently predicts the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any increases would be "gradual" and "limited".
In May, the bank predicted an increase of 1.9 per cent for this year and 1.7 per cent for next year.
Now it kept its growth forecast for 2018 at 1.8 per cent.
The pound weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the pound decreased by 0.5 per cent and was $1.31, which decreased by 0.4 per cent compared to the euro and was €1.11.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was taken after the lower growth rates than expected dampened the increased expectations of interest rate hikes, with GDP rising by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter and by 0.2 per cent in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter but to pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation review gave little hope to households suffering from rising inflation and low wage increases, and the bank said the situation will get worse before it gets better.
The Bank added that monetary policy "can't stop" the fall in income in the next few years, but expects wage developments to recover "significantly" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by the strong growth in demand for British products as a result of a weak pound, which will offset some of the impact of the fall in private consumption.
The decision was made a year after interest rates were lowered to 0.25 per cent after the shock of the EU's referendum, which pushed the pound down.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision will probably be reflected in prices and the economy after four years.
Before the Fed's latest decision, the demand for interest rates had become increasingly loud, as inflation tightened the pressure on households, while three decision-makers demanded a 0.5 per cent increase in July.
Inflation slowed down to 2.6 per cent last month from 2.9 per cent in June, but according to the bank, it was expected and inflation will pick up again in the coming months.
According to the bank, its two per cent target level was exceeded due to a "total" weak pound.
"In view of the recent drop in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market seems to be becoming even more intense as lenders are frantically seeking customers and are keen to close the year," said Andrew Montlake, head of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"The market looks particularly good for those whose current loan contract is closing, with more popular re-contracts, low interest rates, and untapped options."
NHS prescribes controversial HIV drugs to 10,000
As of September, patients can be prescribed a "reversive" anti-HIV drug, and the Supreme Court closed a dispute over the funding of the drug in the UK's public health system (NHS).
NHS reported that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is prescribed to about 10,000 people during the first three-year experiment, and a drug taken before sexual intercourse has been found to reduce the risk of infection by about 86 percent in high-risk individuals.
NHS agreed to fund the experiment after the Court of Appeal upheld last year's Supreme Court ruling that NHS is able to pay for the drug PrEP, even though it is claimed to be funded by local authorities.
England's NHS leader Simon Stevens called the decision announced on Thursday a "significant new intervention", and the National AIDS Association described it as a "opening moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to start signing up for an experiment that will expand to other clinics in October, reaching its full range in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) should be taken before sexual intercourse to reduce the risk of infection.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infections in high-risk groups.
A drug taken before sexual intercourse means that there are enough drugs in the body to prevent HIV infection during sexual intercourse.
The medicine can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The treatment target group includes gay men, bisexual men and transgenders, as well as people with HIV-positive partners who do not receive effective treatment.
The clinics choose eligible candidates for the experiment from men, women and transgenders, as well as those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral treatment for their disease.
People living in England and registered for general medical care can also apply for a trial at their local sexual health clinic.
The programme costs £10 million, and England's NHS signed a contract for medicines this week after an international tender.
The purpose of the experiment is to assess the potential of PrEP by gathering extensive clinical evidence about its targeting, taking and treatment implementation.
"This significant new intervention should complement and intensify the already existing diverse and increasingly effective ways of preventing HIV," Stevens said.
"It is yet another significant achievement in the struggle of more than 30 years to solve one of humanity's biggest health challenges."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," said Deborah Gold, director of the national AIDS organisation.
"If PrEP is properly targeted at those in need and at risk, it can have a revolutionary effect on the HIV epidemic in England.
From September onwards, those at risk will receive a drug that they can decide independently to use through an NHS-funded experiment without the need to negotiate with a partner, which will have a empowering effect that will improve the lives of very many people.
This was welcome news."
"The most important thing now is to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly across the country and that no one at risk is excluded from it," said Ian Green, director of Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The PrEP drug used in the experiment has been acquired, and we will soon be able to protect 10,000 people at risk from HIV infection."
"The start of the PrEP trial is a welcome event that lasted for several months because of the government's slow-down," says Sharon Hodgson, shadow government health minister.
"We have evidence that the drug can have a revolutionary effect on our work to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment will help us to better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the experiment is launched as soon as possible across the country, so that we can protect those exposed to HIV and get another step closer to the situation where the spread of HIV in society has been halted."
Quality of living: the middle floor and smart interior solutions have made the small Earl's Court apartment a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who was excited about the renovation, moved from Knightsbridge's residential area to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of Queen Anna's era-style house, and the success of the renovation is explained by the fact that Joanne has not yet packed up and moved.
"Before this, my ex and I lived in a much bigger apartment in Knightsbridge," Joanne says.
"I'm looking for something similar in my price range.
I went to the house display and found that the rooms were as high as the one I had at the time.
I fell in love immediately and made an offer the same day."
Since then, an apartment of about 90 square metres has undergone a complete transformation.
It was a two-room room where only the kitchen could enter the bedroom. Joanne wanted more storage space and a middle floor to make use of the room height.
"I wanted space, big windows and lots of light.
They were my demands," he said.
He hired Erfan Azad from a Duck & Shed design agency in Notting Hill, where Erfan was assigned to take advantage of the space of rooms nearly four metres high and to create an apartment that would be not just a renovation and sales destination but a home.
The room height wasn't quite enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build a middle floor where you could stand.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfan.
"The steel structures are quite complicated.
The spaces had to be arranged on top of each other so that you don't have to crouch in them.
The structures had to be modified so that the height is just right on top and below them."
Erfan was able to place two full-high rooms on top of each other with fascinating details.
The copper-crossed window of Retrouvius opens in the middle floor to an elegant lounge.
Mirror gold furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille's vintage luminaires create a characteristic style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricalism, a feeling of space and light.
The mirrors at both ends of the short corridor make the corridor look longer than the real one.
The mirror in the middle of the kitchen is like a window with a view to another room.
The mirrored furniture at the entrance has storage space for Joanne's meals and glassware.
To add to the style is to hide the kitchen when it is not used.
The kitchens with the folding door are not a new solution,
But the unique thing about Joanne's kitchen is that the door is raised in the same way as the garage door.
"It took a bit of planning," Erfan says about the steel-steel MDF door.
"It's balanced, meaning it slides very easily when it is lifted into place."
With the rational use of space and the design of the storage space, Joanne got 16 extra square metres, a second bedroom and a better layout.
"When selling a property, the area is the key – or the value of the property," Erfan says.
"In the basic case, the real estate agent walks in to the apartment and calculates the price based on the area."
In Joanne's apartment, the floor area was increased by using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
"The home is in contact with the home's materials, and the emotional connection to the home is partly based on them," Erfan said.
"No one gets attached to electrical wires running through the walls.
They are also important, but not the same."
Joanne's apartment is an example that good design and extra squares can make the basic apartment exceptional.
Then it can also happen that you don't want to move out of the apartment anymore.
Pregnant Princess Sofia beamed in her summer look
Princess Sofia's choice of outfit hit the spot.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden in Båstad for the last time before her birth.
For dinner at A Sustainable Tomorrow, the princess had chosen a light blue dress.
Sofia was smiling on the occasion.
Princess Sofia of Sweden has visited Båstad of Sweden this week.
On Wednesday afternoon, Sofia was represented at the A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a stunning blue body-like outfit, which was a great dress for the last pregnant princess.
Sofia came to the event in a dark blue outfit.
This is the last event Sofia will represent before her birth.
His calculated time is in September.
Sofia had chosen to wear a beautiful pastel blue dress for the event's dinner, which landed fantastically.
The style was crowned with large earrings and a stylish little bag.
The pastel blue dressed the princess well.
Sofia has been to Båstad, Sweden this week, on a representative trip.
Sofia completed her outfit with a small bag.
Sofia was actually beaming in her fresh summer look.
Sofia even got excited about talking to photographers at the event.
Now I'm just holding my stomach, Sofia said laughing and referred to her late pregnancy.
He's raising us with sweet chili
In the summer of 1996, a stall appeared in Lahti market, where Thai food was sold.
The villagers were afraid to taste, but they walked by.
In the booth, Panya Suamsri-Pentila sold food, among the familiars Panja.
He didn't know much about Finnish, and the Finns didn't know Thai at the time.
Since the people were afraid to go to dinner, Panja offered free tastings.
This is how he taught the Gulfs to eat Thai food, one spring roll at a time.
Try some, he said.
I got hooked.
I went more and more, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened her Thai canteen in Lahti's shopping hall.
There were two small tables, I think there were less than 20 customer seats.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to a stranger.
When you're hungry and seats are limited, you can't leave an empty chair between yourself and a stranger.
Little by little, we got to know each other better and became friends.
Finally I sat at the plate with the dictionary learning Thai.
Two years went by the market hall, but then the restaurant had to move, because they said the self-made pastes smelled too much in the hall.
A new place was opened at the end of the hall.
There's room.
Now we jibbers get to sit on our own tables again, only in the most crowded times will we shyly ask strangers if there is room next to them.
Panja knows her customers.
He will be told how things have been going and who has been seen.
He knows what food each eats.
He has seen how the customer's life stages vary and the food club changes.
She remembers the name of the man I went to eat my first spring roll with.
She remembers me thin and fat, and she remembers what I was like when I was young.
It's nice to have lunch a little later than everyone else, sit in my seat next to the kitchen door and catch up with Panja, who leans on the counter.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationalism with sweet chili sauce.
In addition to our sense of taste, he has opened our thoughts and hearts.
Many people now speak Thai to him - thanks to the growing popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though she has had a hard time, she is always friendly.
He's a hard worker.
On top of the restaurant work, he goes to mushrooms and blueberry.
Last week, the restaurant quietly celebrated its two decades of fulfillment.
We customers got strawberry cake for dessert.
Without noise or attention, this remarkable day went by, at work.
The discovery of an underground base revealed 173 Isis terrorists who were ready to strike in Europe
Early in the year, the security authorities received a list that was important for counter-terrorism work.
The list contains information from more than 170 Isis fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are a total of 173 people and the document includes not only their personal data but also photos of everyone.
More than 130 of the people mentioned in the list are Iraqis, but there are also six Europeans.
They come from Belgium, Holland, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhikistan and Saudi Arabia.
Ilta-Sanomat told me about the list and a couple of weeks ago.
Now the location of the list and the information contained in it have become more accurate.
According to the newspaper, Iraqi military special forces found a list of terrorists' personal data and photos while investigating the underground base of the terrorist organisation in Mosul.
The U.S. intelligence authorities assessed the authenticity of the papers and forwarded them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
The background was a fear that something big and serious would be planned in the West by terrorists after Isis fell in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and pictures of all people, but also their date of birth, invented aliases and information about the person's homeland.
The list also specifies the areas of special interest of terrorists.
For example, the German 27-year-old Sami J. on the list reads Abu Assid al-Almani, a German name.
He reportedly left Germany in 2012, traveling first to Egypt, then Libya, and later through Turkey to join ISIS.
A suicide bomber has been written next to his photo.
There is no more accurate information about the man's fate.
About 6,000 fighters, whose fate is uncertain, have left Europe to join ISIS.
The man sank below the surface in Tokoinranta, Helsinki
Based on the interviews with the rescue department, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
Even a bucket can save a drowning life.
On Thursday in Tokoinranta, Helsinki, a person under water was rescued.
According to Ville Estlander, fire master on call at the Helsinki Rescue Department, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found under water about 15 minutes after the announcement.
The rescue department diver found him under the surface, Estlander says.
The rescue department received a notification after 4:30 in the afternoon.
The person was delivered to emergency care.
Estlander says it was a man about 50 years old.
Based on the interviews, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is already over.
Estlander thanks the authorities for their cooperation with the Border Guard and the police.
It was a task led by the Border Guard.
The divers also received excellent guidance from those present.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the Border Guard and the police.
Two cars hit nine people in Eura cars, three were seriously injured
There were a total of nine people in the cars, the rest of whom were less injured, says the on-call firemaster.
Both men and women are among the injured.
The accident took place at the intersection of three roads around four o'clock in the day.
The crash happened when the other car turned from behind the warning triangle in front of the other car, says the fire master on-call.
According to the rescue department, there is a speed limit of 80 kilometres per hour in the intersection area.
Brothers fight over $500 million in real estate
Two brothers are arguing about Victoria's largest real estate empire worth over $500 million, which is linked to a family business founded 40 years ago by their Italian family.
Former Carlton football club president and real estate developer Colin De Lutis lives in the Tooraki value zone just three houses away from his younger brother Paul, who has taken the dispute over the division of real estate and business property between the brothers to the Supreme Court.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business already since 2014, but there is a bitter dispute over the divorce.
The brothers and their mother Anna together own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, and the family began to accumulate assets when they bought a shop on Collingwood Smith Street in 1973.
The family established a Westco Jeans store there, which expanded into a chain of 160 stores.
The store chain was sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was spent on real estate, and the family now owns offices, property development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping centres.
According to an agreement with the late father of the family, Colin owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul owns about a third of the company's assets. Paul describes his father as "the carrying force and the central character of the family."
According to court records, the property-sharing ratio means Colin owns real estate worth about $316 million and Paul worth about $176 million.
Paul is not satisfied with the distribution of real estate and money.
"I think Colin left the best real estate to himself in his proposal," Paul wrote in his first sworn testimony to the court in 2015.
Last Friday, the case was dealt with for the first time in the Supreme Court after several mediation attempts.
The brothers are now also arguing over who controls the existing business, and Paul claims Colin has ruled him out.
According to Colin, the claim is not true, and he blames Paul for the poor treatment of some properties.
Colin writes in one of his first affidavits that he would like to find a solution.
"In line with our Italian traditions, the family is the most important thing for me," Colin said in his statement.
There are hundreds of pages of depositions, emails and reports about the case, and there are consultants such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as some of the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who set up dairy bars and delicacy shops in the late 1950s, buying a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They were used as collateral when the family bought a real estate in Collingwood, where Colin founded the family's first jeans shop.
Colin said he had set up a store "in the last years of high school, when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer the real estate to their sons in a friendly way.
"Luigi often said he doesn't want the brothers to end up in court," Anna writes in her statement.
The other two sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis group's business, and Colin said that Mark received $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are "bitter about the financial conditions of their departure."
Colin has kept a low profile, even though he is a former board member of the Australian Football League Society and television star Eddie McGuire's best friend, according to this biography that appeared in 2015.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied, and in his text message he said he couldn't really comment on the matter because it's being handled in court.
"It's very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag our family's name into a legal battle," he wrote.
In mid-2016 Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father didn't want us to fight like this," Colin continued, saying he still hopes that a solution will be found.
On Friday, the hope seemed to have passed out.
"Our case will be settled in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media use.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally make it.
First.
According to Poltico, the White House's new chief of staff plans to restrict President Trump's media use and news monitoring so that the boss doesn't get in so many trouble.
Journalist Josh Dawsey reported:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with the executive staff on his first working day, he raised a key issue he intends to solve: he plans to limit President Donald Trump's access to information.
Kelly told the White House employees that all information, whether printed or heard at press conferences, must pass through her because the president makes better decisions when he gets good information."
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's media use and failed.
President Trump has decades of television relations - and as president he still watches a lot of television.
"If presidential candidate Trump got upset about unfair news coverage, it was worth showing him that the sympathetic media dealt more fairly," Sam Nunberg, who worked as an advisor in Trump's campaign, told Politico in February.
Politico's journalist Tara Palmeri then wrote that "six former campaign workers said that it is essential to control Trump's use of Twitter that his personal media flow includes a steady stream of praises."
Okay.
But it's ridiculous to say Trump's Twitter use was ever under control.
Maybe these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don't know - maybe Trump's tweets would've been even wilder without their efforts.
We will probably never know what kind of messages Trump missed.
If his staff has even a few times been able to prevent him from causing problems, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from causing the fuss.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are rival groups in the White House who are trying to pursue their cause by providing Trump with information that supports their vision, and that information can be reliable - or not.
In May Politico wrote that the advisors deliberately provide the president with questionable information.
Shane Goldmacher, a reporter, said about an incident:
"Trump's current and ex-workers say he can be furious about newspaper clippings that criticise him - especially if they tell him about harmful leaks of information - and then he has to know exactly where the information comes from.
That's what happened at the end of February, when someone mischievously gave the president a copy of the news on the GotNews.com website, established by Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of several White House leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter because of harassment, and he had previously spread false accusations and withdrew them later, and he did not provide any concrete evidence.
However, Trump had begun to ask the staff about Walsh after reading the story."
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus, and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "had tried to introduce a document management system for Trump."
And what was the result?
Kelly's going to try the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants are still pursuing their own business.
These unchangeable facts make Kelly's task very difficult.
Neymar signed a five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, reports AFP news agency.
Earlier on Thursday evening, Neymar's representatives had paid FC Barcelona, who played football in the Spanish league, a €222 million buyout price.
Neymar's contract with Barcelona was therefore dissolved and was free to move to PSG in Paris.
The dizzy sum of EUR 222 million is the biggest in football history.
Previously, Manchester United had a record that cost 105 million euros last summer for French Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a state-owned company based in Qatar.
The club is chaired by former tennis pro Nasser al-Khelaifi from Qatar.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
Success writer Raija Oranen beat alcoholism and fear of flying with hypnosis: "I'm fine in my life"
From the TV series, Rose's time and Clean White Sheets, Raija Oranen, a famous success writer, just celebrated her 69th birthday.
Hypnosis helped Raija Oras.
Five grandkids hold her so in their grip, along with writing, that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola's apartment after 18 winter.
At first they sold their house, but now in the spring there was also a rental home.
In the light and in the sun, away from the old circles, Raija was once driven by depression and alcoholism that she has survived.
The external appearance is also 20 kilos lighter.
The weight went down when the serotonin drugs were stopped, they were mood drugs.
Alcoholism once helped me with hypnosis, which also worked in fear of flying, I won it.
I've been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes a person, a radiant writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have travelled together for over 45 years.
I'm better than ever.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who also worked in the tourism industry, have been going together for over 40 years.
I proposed, and it was getting married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
That's the kind of drama queen she's always been, ending her life like that, Jyrki laughs at his wife.
Oranen, who made a huge career as a writer, only remembers a 44-part clean white sheets TV series that touched and moved Finland during the recession.
I finally decided to work in the clothing industry of the Fresh Family company when I read Liisa Seppälä's 50-year interview on the plane.
I was the daughter of a sewing machine, my mother also had a clothing store, and sometimes I was a mannequin, Oranen recalls.
He thought the plot and story of the series changed the Finns' attitude towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen's research and dissertation revealed it, says Oranen.
Raija Oranen lives as a writer for active time, she has many scripts to work on - hundreds of ideas.
The roundabouts returned across the ditch to the "millionaires' alley"
One of the wealthiest house owners in West Midlands is once again on the hairlines with the persistent drifters, who managed to cross the ditch the municipality needed and return to the field next to the houses.
The roundabouts parked some 20 caravans near a street called a millionaire alley in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the moat they needed as a barrier, bringing with them children, horses and an army of vans.
The roundabouts managed to cross the obstacle at a point that had been left unprotected because of the path.
Enraged residents have accused the municipality of Solihull of "complete inability to solve the problem."
An anonymous resident reports that the Travellers came from Bentley Heath on Monday evening, where they had thrown rocks at passers-by.
"The municipality needs to be tough on action because it seems completely incapable of solving the problem.
The Tourers were here in May, then they left but returned again.
There were more of them in the evening and probably even more today."
The resident said the municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by denying access to parks.
"I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay municipal tax when the municipality can't do anything about it."
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the Travellers returned so soon after they were driven away.
"There are more of them than before, and they have even put a horse in a grazing park."
According to a spokesman for Solihull County, the municipality is aware of the illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. "We are about to take the necessary legal action with Solihull Police to evict the campers as soon as possible.
From the point of view of gathering evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report disturbing or criminal activities to the police.
It helps to create an overall picture of the situation for the trial."
Enraged people surrounded Portugal's crash machine
In Portugal, men who have made an emergency landing on a beach full of people have been questioned in court today.
Two people died yesterday as a result of the crash.
Two men who have flown the plane can be charged with involuntary death.
The longest it can be, it can be 16 years in prison in Portugal.
A man-flyed small plane had to make an emergency landing on Sao Joao da Caparica beach near Lisbon yesterday because of a technical fault.
There were hundreds of people on the beach at the time of the event, some of whom ran to the water to escape the plane.
The plane hit a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died immediately.
The plane first hit the man who was on the back of the plane.
Immediately after the plane went up and when it landed again, it hit the child's head, told Filipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias, who was on the beach.
The little girl who was killed was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents were not hurt.
Those on the beach surrounded the small plane immediately after the crash, angry.
The girl's father and other people went to the plane and began beating its tail, reported Celia Rocha in Correio da Manha, who witnessed the incident.
The man called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It's a miracle no more people died.
The two men on the plane were not injured in the crash landing.
The Finnish star who tragically lost his foot won the World Cup again: "Without an accident, I wouldn't be the world champion"
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated Finland's time early Wednesday morning in a competition at the banked lalom in Big White, Canada.
Suur-Hamari also won the World Championship gold earlier in the games.
A total of three World Championship titles have already been gathered.
It's a pretty amazing World Championship!
The gold was taken care of twice, the time with a good heart rate was pulled, the phone-reached Suur-Hamari rejoiced.
A 30-year-old calculator praised his coach and the very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Suur-Hamar, the number of challengers in the sport is growing.
The whole para snowboarding has grown and developed very much lately.
The differences are getting smaller and there are a lot of new calculators involved.
You always wonder if there's a black horse coming from behind.
Every race seems to have a different winner.
Suur-Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
She had been enthusiastically counting since she was young with her friends, and the accident didn't take her desire to get to the slope.
After all, it reminds me from time to time, what my life would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that there is no point in ifsing.
The cards are played, which have been shared, says Suur-Hamari.
It would be cruel to call a serious accident and the loss of a limb a lucky kick, and the Great Hamari will not do that.
But he turned the terrible difficulty to his advantage.
Yes, I would say that the situation has turned into a victory.
I wouldn't be a triple world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the 23-year-old Suur-Hamar's greatest passion for boarding was already waning.
It wasn't until after the accident that I started working towards the top.
I trained with my friends when I was young, and we were always excited about X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that dimmed somewhat over time.
After the accident, I somehow found myself there in the X-Games startup.
I couldn't have imagined it in advance.
I was 23 years old and I thought this would be a really long life if I stayed here to be bitter and sad.
I decided to pull my overalls on and get to work.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
The calculator was very pleased with the choice of wheelchair roller Leo-Pekka Star as an athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympic winner won his prize at the sports gala in January.
According to Suur-Hamar, the Star's victory is an important signal for parasports people.
It was a really big deal, and the victory was definitely earned.
This certainly also opens eyes to the parasport world.
When is it time to launch the sportsman of the Year campaign of the double world champion Matti Suur-Hamar?
We'll see about that in due course.
I try to do my best to succeed.
As yet, the Grand Hamari has not conquered all the peaks he wants.
Next year there will be a big goal.
In a year's time, Paralympic Games will take place in South Korea.
They're going to get a medal!
The majority of Syrian young refugees do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently unless the war ends and Isis leaves the country
The A Voice for Young Syria's Refugees study examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees baking bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of young Syrians do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently.
According to them, the end of the war in Syria and Isis leaving the country are the most important things that should happen to allow them to return to their homeland.
The Trump administration is not seen to bring about a change in the Syrian conflict.
The communications office chain Burson-Marsteller studied the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
For nine years, Burson-Marsteller has studied the opinions and attitudes of Arab youth.
This year, the A Voice for Young Syria's Refugees study examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 young Syrians aged 18-24 responded to the study, half of whom are women and half men.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not think they will return to their homeland permanently in the future.
Forty-two per cent of respondents can think of returning to their home country and four per cent could not say.
According to the study, the young people's decision to return home is most influenced by the war in Syria and by the presence of Isis in the country.
Nearly half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most important factor for a permanent return, while a quarter feel that leaving the country would be the most important.
Less than one-tenth of the most important factors affecting the decision are the improvement in the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military action alone will not solve the conflict
Syrian youth were asked which factor is the most important to end the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of the war is more essential than the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad.
A good quarter sees al-Assad's presidency as an obstacle to the peace agreement.
Nearly half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to end the current Syrian conflict.
You don't believe more than a quarter in solving the conflict with mere military action.
The majority of Syrian young refugees see the power of ISIS weakened in the last year, while the fifth feels its power strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important thing in the fight against ISIS and terrorism in general is that the media would pass on information to people that ISIS had nothing to do with Islam.
Nearly as many made military measures and education reform a priority.
In the view of a fair tenth, the most important thing would be to create better-paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the effects of Trump's regime on the Syrian conflict, 66 per cent of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during Trump's regime.
Nearly one in four believes the Syrian conflict will worsen during Trump's period.
Opinions are divided as to whether Russia's and Iran's involvement has improved or worsened the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half his time coding to keep the Internet in order - the database he developed uses for example Wikipedia and Google
The Espoo-based company MariaDB is developing an open source database "the fastest growing in the world."
The main product of the encoder entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius founded MariaDB does not cost users anything, and it can be developed online by any skilled programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they are not necessarily paying customers.
With the help of databases, huge mass of information remains in order and quickly available.
If you use, for example, Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, they will use MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that is not in the image format comes from the database, and the photos are also linked," Widenius explains.
Widenius, who is MariaDB's technology leader, spends about half his time coding.
A man working remotely from Kauniainen will help to ensure that the internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database, MySQL, together with Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun bought MySQL for $1 billion, and a year later the software giant Oracle devoured Sun with $7.4 billion.
When the Oracle deal happened, a large number of MySQL developers said they were leaving.
"They didn't want to work for Oracle, who didn't make a sure promise about MySQL's future," Widenius recalls.
Already at this stage he had set up a company that began to develop MariaDB.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired some of Sun's top 20 developers to ensure that the continuity of the code is secured with the same friends who created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
The name just had to be changed.
A foundation was set up to monitor the freedom of development of MariaDB's code.
"There were no such confirmations during MySQL," Widenius laments.
Although many have heard about Widenius and MySQL's billion-dollar deal, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
"In recent years, our growth rate has been about 50 per cent per year," said Kenneth Paqvalén, MariaDB's CFO.
MariaDB, which is focused on growth, does not make a profit yet, and Paqvalén is narrowly worded about the company's key figures.
To that extent, she reveals that in the current financial year, MariaDB estimates to receive orders worth 20 million euros.
Since the database is free, the company has developed services around it that corporate customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps to exchange databases, which can be over a year's work if the customer has used a closed database.
The switch from MySQL to MariaDB will be possible in no time, because they are versions of each other.
Among other things, the Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank in Southeast Asia DBS are paying customers of MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alibaban Cloud, offer MariaDB to their customers.
At the same time, MariaDB spreads automatically to new users in Linux operating system distribution packages, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we're a small company, we have connections to the biggest players.
"Our customers include the world's largest telecommunications operators, gaming companies, banks and even a few central banks," Paqvalé lists.
The database market is still dominated by giants like Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with their closed databases.
For Oracle, too, MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company's traditional closed database.
While research company Gartner said the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, in terms of turnover, players like MariaDB are still insignificant, albeit fast growing seals.
In a database market of about $50 billion, open source databases do not even reach $1 billion.
However, the weight of the open source code cannot be measured only in money, because most users don't pay anything for these software.
Research company Gartner predicts that in 2018, companies will already develop more than 70 per cent of their internal applications over open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would then have been exchanged for open databases, or the transition would at least have started.
Large companies do not get new customers, because most of them will choose an open source code next.
This has led to licence fees for commercial databases jumping into the clouds.
Companies want to make as much money as they did earlier with a smaller number of customers," Widenius says.
Since it is difficult to change a closed database, most customer companies have swallowed price increases obediently.
"There are a lot of customers for whom the transition is really difficult, because their old applications and others are closed in a closed database," Widenius said.
He still believes that the customer's size is about to be filled.
When licence fees go up every year, the customer will sooner or later move to an open source database.
The price is 10-20 per cent of the previous, and the service is better, because the customer can easily switch to another database if he wants.
Besides, many companies are already facing major system changes as they transfer their operations to cloud services.
At the same time, many change database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received a loan of 25 million euros from the EIB.
It was the largest growth funding ever granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide and is now planning to hire more.
One of the reasons for EIB's funding was MariaDB's impact on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector customers, for example in Britain and Germany.
The public sector in Europe costs billions of euros a year from databases.
"Many countries want to move on to open source solutions and thus spend tax money more efficiently," Paqvalén says.
Widenius is upset about spending money on closed healthcare systems in Finland, for example, when open systems are cheaper, and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say open source is ideology, but I think it's a better way to make code.
The community helps and does things that it cannot or cannot do.
In addition to another Finnish developer of Linux, Linus Torvalds, 55-year-old Widenius is one of the most well-known open source promoters.
Widenius helps other companies to develop functional business models over open source.
I still give 4-5 speeches on this topic every year around the world.
Italy is stepping up its attitude towards NGOs rescue ships
Italy has warned non-governmental organisations that rescue refugees on their ships in the Mediterranean, that they cannot continue to operate unless they commit to complying with the new rules governing their operations.
"If non-governmental organisations are not committed to the new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to operate," Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti said in an interview with La Stampa newspaper in Turin.
Minnit's warning came the day after the Italian authorities seized a German ship from the Jugend Rettet, a crew suspected of cooperating with human smugglers to promote illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which served only a year, refused to comment on prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio's detailed charges.
"For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing, and we are very sorry that we are not currently able to operate in the search and rescue area," the organisation announced in a statement published in social media.
"We can only judge the accusations after we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the Iuventa platform of Jugend Rettet since October.
The crew is suspected to have taken on board boatloads of refugees directly from human smugglers who got the boats to re-use.
One such incident is claimed to have taken place just a couple of kilometres off the coast of Libya, as evidenced by a prosecutor's document published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected to have defied the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area, and is seen as a motive for enthusiasm for help.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa should be accompanied by an Italian police officer who oversees the operations.
Only three of the nine non-governmental organisations involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to follow the code of conduct: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
which announced on Thursday that it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable because they do not cause "significant changes or obstacles" to the organisation's rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to follow the code of conduct is Nobel Prize-winning Doctors Without Frontiers.
Minniti, on the other hand, said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy with rescue measures has fallen sharply in recent weeks, as he sees it as evidence that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors are beginning to produce results.
"In the last few days, light has begun to appear at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed that there are plans to continue discussions this month with Libyan mayors on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving for Europe.
The seasonal worker is suspected to have killed his common-law spouse in Enontekiö, the suspect was found in the terrain - a case for the prosecutor
The suspected crime was committed in Kuttanen, Enontekiö, last December.
According to police, a 36-year-old Czech man is suspected to have killed his 26-year-old Scottish cohabiting partner.
Previously it has been said that both were seasonal workers.
The police have also said that the suspect, after what he did, would have fled with two dogs to the terrain.
The man was found cold in the terrain and did not resist the capture.
The charge in the case must be filed in less than a week.
The case may still be dealt with in the District Court of Lapland in August.
Robert Hardy, famous for Harry Potter and All Hairy Friends series, has died
British girl Robert Hardy has died at the age of 91.
The actor's death was announced by his family on Thursday.
Hardy, who was born in 1925, started his acting career at the theatre at the age of 24.
During his long career, he also played in films and television.
Hardy is especially remembered for the role of magic minister Cornelius Toffee in Harry Potter films and for his role as a vet in a television series All Hairy Friends based on James Herriot's book.
The BBC's popular show was filmed for seven seasons in all.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to prison for text messages inciting suicide
The Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years in jail for text messages and phone calls that she was considered to have incited her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, is serving 15 months of her sentence in prison and five years on probation.
Carter was convicted of killing in June, and his boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said during Thursday's session.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter applied for an appeal to the sentence and was allowed to wait for the application to be examined in freedom.
He was threatened with a 20-year sentence, but his lawyers said both Carter and Roy were suffering from mental health problems.
Carter, wearing red pants and a creamy blouse, listened to his sentence with his hands crossed with a crying look on the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court.
"He ended Conrad's life to improve his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the act," the prosecutor continued.
"He hasn't shown any remorse."
Carter's lawyer said the incident was caused by "the shocking circumstances that Carter deeply regrets."
Judge Lawrence Moniz felt, however, that Carter's "age or maturity level and even mental health problems had no significant effect on his actions."
The prosecutor read a statement from Conrad's mother, Lynn Roy, in which she said: "Not a day goes by that I won't mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I can cope with all of this, and I will do my best to comfort his sisters in the pain that we will always bear."
Conrad's sister, Camdy Roy, told the court that he is "stalking" about the idea that he will never see his brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"It's painful to lose someone who's been in my life every day since I was born, and that pain will never stop," Camdy said.
The case seems to set a precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that inciting suicide is a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a car for carbon monoxide poisoning in 2014.
The incident attracted national attention when it turned out Carter had incited his boyfriend to commit suicide in his text messages.
"Shut yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself. I don't know, there are many ways," Carter wrote in many of the messages he had sent to Roy during the two weeks before his death. Roy was on vacation with his family at the time.
Just before Roy killed himself, Carter wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention with Roy's death, and the judge ordered Carter not to benefit from the incident by giving interviews.
The case has divided experts' opinions.
Few have defended Carter, one of whom is Amanda Knox, 30 who was convicted of the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007.
The Los Angeles Times published Knox's opinion paper, saying: "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison."
NATO Secretary-General: The worst in Russia since the Cold War
The relationship between NATO and Russia has deteriorated clearly, commented NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its position in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think it can be said that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War," Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability caused by Russia in eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
But, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to working in such a way that tensions don't get strained.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid the escalation of the situation and the new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump found that the relationship between the USA and Russia has even fallen to a dangerously bad level.
Trump said to thank the Congress for the bad relations between the countries, which approved new sanctions against Russia last week.
Audi is making changes to 850 000 diesel engines due to the setback experienced by car manufacturers
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW offered to update over 350,000 car software.
BMW's manager said the company believed that "there are more sensible options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including BMW's hometown of Munich, which are considering restricting or banning diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced changes to engines of over 3 million Mercedes to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies spoke of a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly marketed diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to meet their CO2 emissions targets.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The cost of installing equipment that neutralizes emissions will rise, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are being closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of supporting large car companies and ignoring problems.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes, and Volkswagen installed cheat devices in cars that reduced emissions to the level of the regulations in the tests, and in normal driving the emissions were higher.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been charged in the United States, but their actions are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former thermodynamics director of Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be extradited to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was dragged into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen, and authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in his cars to circumvent Europe's emissions requirements, based on a similar investigation in the United States.
Audi's investigation can significantly weaken Volkswagen's position: the manufacturer of luxury cars has a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
The Venezuelan vote opened a fraud investigation, big demonstrations are coming
According to the company, the number of voters reported by Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of real voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion of a firm that has no role in the election result, Tibisay Lucena, chairman of the National Election Board, told journalists.
Maduro assures that the crisis will end
On Sunday, in a controversial vote, a representative body was elected in Venezuela to change the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised protests against it.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed their own demonstrations so that they would be underway at the time of appointment.
According to El Pais, the country's national security forces began to take over the country's parliament building on Wednesday evening.
The troops are meant to ensure the security of the appointments.
Climate change threatens Provence lavender
Lavender has become a symbol of the Provence region of southern France, but now it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender had been reduced due to drought and disease-bearing insects, and researchers and farmers are frantically trying to find a solution to the problem.
"The lavender is downright threatened in Provence's area because it has suffered the effects of climate change in recent years, which has led to a marked reduction in the rainfall in spring, especially in autumn," says Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Agricultural Research Institute in Provence.
"This shortens the lavender's life span.
In addition, drought has brought a lot of small cicadas to the area that spread micro-bacterials."
The stakes are high.
Lavender oil attracts tourists and is also a highly desired ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
"Instead of long ears and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed, weakened or missing altogether," Chaisse says.
"In other words, there are fewer parts of essential oil."
The solution is sought by stepping up irrigation, slowing the evaporation of soil moisture and spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water, and by developing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The murder of a journalist is a growing threat in Mexico
A weekly newspaper, Riodoce, usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss how the paper deals with the latest cases of organised crime, corrupt authorities and the endless drug war in the state of Sinaloa.
But today we are discussing security because of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been advised to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists discuss which is safer: to leave the children home or to take them to a delivery that was hit with a grenade in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the blackboard in the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask journalists to name names for each group, there is no need for evidence, there are enough observations and feelings.
They write the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected to be on government or drug cartel payroll, criminals who make Mexico's chaos a threat to the news.
According to the Journalists Protection Committee, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012, with 589 journalists attacked and threatened under federal protection, and at least seven journalists in seven states have been murdered in the past year.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder of Riodoce, journalist and source of inspiration.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
The front of the Riodoce building is covered with a huge picture of Valdez showing a middle finger, which says, "Judge." The 30-year-old reporters Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are wearing T-shirts that are decorated with Valdez's smiling face. Valdez has spectacles and a panama hat that has become a trademark.
The meeting will take place less than two months after Valdez's death, and reporters will discuss their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia fears.
A federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists' cases in particular, but to date, according to the Journalists Protection Committee, only two charges have been filed.
Journalists' murderers rarely go to court, as well as thousands of murders involving drug trafficking and organised crime a year, but few end up in court.
Riodoce's reporters are going to continue writing about the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are devastated and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security meeting is of little use because the killers are not known and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is frankly a waste of time," he said.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know why."
Valdez had left Riodoce's delivery in the capital of the state, Culiacan, in the morning of 15 May 2017.
He had driven only a couple of blocks in his red Toyota when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and fired twelve shots, presumably related to the name of the magazine: Riodoce means the 12th river.
The shooter drove off in Valdez's car and crashed it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
The wife and two adult children were left to mourn him.
Rumors move fast and squirm freely in Culiac.
However, the death of Valdez is still silent.
Sinaloa has been one of Mexico's bloodiest battlefields since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January, and rival factions want to fill the void.
Someone or several people are shot to death every day on the streets of Sinaloa, and there are two-storey, two-storey funeral homes of drug lords in the cemetery that are bigger than many homes.
The state on the coast is "peaceful" when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, a 60-year-old founder and director of Riodoce, feels guilty that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to the murder of Valdez.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez, leading a rival group that is waging a war against Guzman's sons.
The Guzman boys may have been angry with the story: customers suspected of being members of the gang bought every issue of the magazine as soon as the paper came to the sales points.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper that published the same story was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career in Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to set up Riodoce with five colleagues and sold the magazine shares for $50.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem," Bojorquez says.
Over time, the magazine became known for its bold and honest stories, and its sales and advertising revenue grew.
Journalists appreciated the possibility of publishing hard-core investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by stories in the newspaper that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after it was founded, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for news coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez received the International Press Freedom Prize of the Journalist Protection Committee for his courage to follow Mexico's story of drug trafficking without letup.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to move on with my life," he said when he received the journalist protection committee award.
Drug trafficking is a "lifestyle" in Sinaloa, Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"The supplier must accept the task that falls on him - or act stupid.
I don't want anyone to have to ask me where I was when death was sown here - why didn't I tell me what was going on?"
Riodoce's staff misses Valdez - a joker who cursed like a port worker - a friend who always gave them a hug and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He always wore a panama hat.
He went to an El Guayabo bar across from the delivery and was always sitting at the same table.
Now they ask whether the routines killed him.
The death of a colleague has also caused them to wonder how they can best do their work and stay alive.
"The criminals don't like it if we deal in our cases with their women and children and their clean businesses, their secret drug trade runways.
They were left out of the story," Bojorquez says.
Even at best, it meant strong self-censorship and self-preservation,
Trusting your own instincts.
If you feel that things are not right, you have to stay away.
The problem, according to Riodoce's journalist Andres Villarreal, is that "the impression can be deceiving, and it happened in Javier's case."
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to be brought into the room where Riodoce's security training was held, and a few days earlier it had become apparent that only spyware sold to governments had been used to track activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had sought shelter in the shade of a tree from a 40-degree heat.
The state government had ordered them to guard Riodoce's premises, located in a four-story building in the middle class area of Culiac.
Some of the reporters were half-played about whether these two police officers were among the 50 percent that the governor of the state did not consider trustworthy.
It had been months since reporters had visited a mountainous countryside dominated by drug gangs.
For this week's issue, Riodoce's delivery planned three main cases.
The boxing greatness Julio Cesar Chavez's brother had been killed in Sinaloa.
The newspaper also intended to reveal that the government's spending was concentrated in the governor's hometown.
In addition, a group of people had been kidnapped in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, just a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official information about who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to proceed cautiously: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug dealers and officials.
The reporter found out from public documents that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician from the Powerful Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), who has dominated Mexican politics at all levels for nearly a century.
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in cases that have received much publicity.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in the same place, one of which "El Chapo" Guzman's son managed to escape and avoid military raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that Valdez's column would provide reliable information about the kidnapping.
"In the past, we would have known what had happened," says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has been nicknamed "El Flaco", Owukainen because of his slender physique.
"Now all communications to our information sources are down."
Valdez's office has been turned into a warehouse with signs and stickers against the persecution of journalists, a new, unexpected task for newspaper employees: they have become activists for press freedom.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took along a few signs the following morning to a demonstration outside the local prosecutor's office, which was caused by another journalist's murder.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoaca three days after the murder of Valdez.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found, which, based on the DNA tests carried out by the authorities, is Adame.
Journalists have started to protest more loudly throughout the country, and protests about the sidewalks and buildings are showing "SOS Press."
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is seeking international support for the Valdez case investigation.
The day after Valdez was murdered, Ramirez met the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying on and killing journalists for telling the truth.
He has since asked to be removed from government cases because he is concerned that he cannot be objective in his anger.
Valdez had repeatedly said that in Mexico journalists were surrounded by organised crime, crime-permissive authorities and indifferent society.
In his last book Narcojournalism Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed, under the orders of politicians and security forces, in agreement with organised crime.
According to Articulo 19, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were caused by police and authorities.
"In Mexico, people are silenced by killing," Ramirez says.
The murders have a crippling effect.
Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the border state of Tamaulipas in the north six years ago.
There was a note signed by the Zetas cartel at his body: "I'm here for my writing."
Next to his cut-off head was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some of the newspapers have decided to close, such as the El Norte newspaper in the border state of Chihuahua in the north after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Some continue to operate, like Nuevo Laredon El Manana, even though its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez posted a note to drug cartels on his front page: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their states or the whole country.
It's a difficult decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and you have to be on guard all the time.
Sometimes criminals were looking for a journalist, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he escaped from Veracruz.
For those who continue to work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra, who was once supposed to be a poet, admits that writing about the drug trade scares me.
"I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell," he said.
Some time ago, Riodoce's reporters sat in front of the delivery on the sidewalk at midnight on Friday when the latest issue of the magazine had been completed, and suddenly their phones began to vibrate as a sign of a message.
In a shooting between rival gangs and security forces, 19 people had died at Mazatlan beach resort.
The war accelerated, as promised in the cartel messages found in the area.
The reporters posted the news on Riodoce's website from the sidewalk with their smartphones.
The front page had to be rewritten the next day.
Sirens howled nearby - another shooting.
Bojorquez glanced at the officers guarding the delivery:
if they were afraid, they covered it very well.
Riodoce's delivery continued the tradition of the murdered founder of the magazine under this massive portrait, where the man gives a finger to the whole Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says he can't even think about stopping the operation. "How could I stop the paper when our intern asked to go on the street and do a story the same day Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project began with a huge setback - "A tough place"
Hannu Manninen, who was 39 years old in April, left the party short, as the professional pilot began preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the training period began catastrophically when Manninen got the flu.
That was the beginning of a long period of illness that lasted almost five weeks.
May went practically completely when I was sick.
First there was the flu, and finally there was a child's disease like an ear infection that I had to take an antibiotic treatment for.
I was able to make only 10 percent of the planned exercises.
I can't remember the last time I've been sick that long.
It was hard when I couldn't make use of my training enthusiasm, Manninen tells Ilta-Sanomis.
Test result collapsed
The 2007 world champion did not receive a training permit until the second week of June, as was shown in the competition and top sports research centre KIHU's roller mat test of June 12.
In the test, the athlete skis with roller skis on a carpet, the speed of which is increased every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the rug stops for about 10 seconds, and the tester uses a needle to sample lactic acid from the tip of the athlete's finger.
Last autumn I was on the carpet for 32 minutes, but now I only stayed 28 minutes.
There was a wall, Manninen said.
For the better
After the undergrads, Manninen says he has remained healthy.
I've done a variety of peaceful aerobic exercises to normalize the body's metabolism.
Now there's a really good five-week episode back there.
Midsummer also had a week and a half away from flying.
I also had time to visit the cottage with my family.
Last season, Manninen entered only four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Championships.
The best result was immediately seen in the opening competition, when Manninen rose to 18th on top skiing.
Guidelines drawn
Manninen and Petter Kukkonen, head coach of the national team, have made a training and competition plan until next February.
We are now looking for different rhythms compared to the last season.
After the first snow games, Ruka would have a weekend of three World Cup Games.
In December, the plan would be to be part of at least one of the World Cup weekends, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January, the plans would still be in Seefeld.
Hopefully after that, the name will be on the Olympic team list, says Manninen.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would be Manninen's sixth winter Olympics already.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, the Nummelian who celebrated gold in the team competition in Salt Lake City in 2002.
Dinosaur protected himself from his enemies by masking
At first it looks like a scary statue.
Now researchers have revealed the first findings of a creature the size of a rhino found by a Canadian miner who was so well preserved that experts call it the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.
It had been preserved so well that researchers were even able to determine that its scaly skin was red-brown and had "a problematic past."
According to Current Biology, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur of all time and one of the best representatives of its sport in the world.
The recently discovered fossil is a nodosaurus, which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous era 110-112 million years ago.
Researchers view this amazingly well-preserved fossil as a truly significant discovery.
According to National Geographic, an armored vegetarian is the best preserved fossil of all time.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, and found by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that didn't seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock and decided to study his findings more closely.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to Tyrrell's Royal Paleontological Museum.
For six years, the beast was excavated from a 300-pound block.
The results of hard work are now visible.
"If you squint your eyes, you can almost believe it was sleeping," says science writer Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum.
"It remains in the history of science as Mona Lisa of dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
The leather studies found that meat-eating dinosaurs were likely a significant threat to this vegetarian, even though it had armor and resembled a walking tank.
Its red and white armor masked it from predators, and it was also protected by darker and lighter coloring from the top, which still exists in many animals.
Experts said it could thus better mix with its environment and avoid its enemies, larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old nodosaurus came to the headlines in May and is now on display in Tyrrell's Royal Paleontological Museum.
Researchers have named it Borealope after markmitchelli museum technician Mark Mitchell, who was part of a team that took over 7,000 hours to dig up a dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has survived so amazingly well that Mitchell and an international team of researchers have been able to determine the pattern and shape of its body scales and armor.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by the general coloring, where the body is darker on top and lighter under.
The observation was still a surprise, since Borealope is considerably larger than the animals that are present with the same coloring.
It suggests that meat-eating dinosaurs caught it to such an extent that evolution favored hiding instead of fighting as a means of survival.
For example, deer, zebras and armadillos have the same coloring about the current animals, which are considerably smaller and therefore easier to catch, suggesting that the nodosaurus was seriously threatened.
"The hunting of a large, heavily armored dinosaur tells how dangerous the dinosaurs of the Cretaceous season were," Brown says.
A chemical analysis of the organic compounds of the scales of the Nodosaurus reveals that its skin was red brown.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaurus in order to draw conclusions about its life, including the contents of its gut to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Researchers believe that when it died it fell into a river and drifted to the sea, where it sank to its back in the seabed.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in Florida, and rivers and seas are likely to go much further than they do today.
"This nodosaurus is really significant because its scaly skin is preserved and it has also been preserved three-dimensionally in its original form," Brown said.
"That's why it looks almost the same as in the early Cretaceous Age
It doesn't take much imagination to perceive it: if you squint a little, you can almost believe it was sleeping."
The Cretaceous Age was an era of thethropods, huge bipeds, meat-eating dinosaurs.
Though their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years before Borealopeta, its mighty predecessors may have hunted this armored dinosaur.
The predecessors of Tyrannosaurus rex included, for example, the Acrocanthosaur, a six-ton monster about 11.5 metres long.
The latest findings of Nodosaurus researchers have been published in Current Biology, who believe Borealope washed into the sea after his death and mummified in mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, and found by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur with skin and armor from snout to hip.
The nodosaurus averaged five metres long and weighed up to 1,300 kilos.
Two half-metres of spikes rose from their pallets.
Researchers believe that this armored vegetarian passed through the current West Canada until a flooded river carried it to the open sea.
Its armor has been preserved in small details in an undersea grave.
Its fossilized remains have been preserved so well that its skin remains in the tank's bumpy plates along its skull.
In fact, Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic that such preservation is "as rare as winning the lottery.
The closer you look at it, the more amazing it seems.
There is still fossilised leather in the bumpy plates of that skull armor.
Its right forefoot is on its side, five toes up.
I can also count the scales on its sole."
How did one activist learn to answer the question: Who do the streets belong to?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on 9 August.
A day earlier he had come to New York from his home in St. Louis and sat on his airbnb apartment's bed browsing Facebook on his phone.
That's when he noticed a message from a high school friend:
"The police just killed an 18-year-old kid, and his body is still on the street."
Confused, he noticed that no one else had posted the same information to his feed, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had numerous retweets from @TheePharoah.
The username belongs to a rapper living in St. Louis, who tweeted in real time about Michael Brown's death, and the white police had shot an unarmed 18-year-old black Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
The user had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street, where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put his phone away, and when he returned to Twitter later that night, people were told that people were gathering on Canfield Drive.
The users posted pictures of police tape and screaming people, as well as a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who carried a sign saying: "Ferguson Police just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell followed a real-time video of police standing in front of protesters with a barking dog.
He also said he saw a video of another cop arming his rifle and shouting, "I'm going to kill all of you... animals."
"This isn't normal," Ferrell remembers saying.
"It wasn't the kind of murder we've already gotten used to and could be called typical.
That's when I felt the chills.
I was angry and I cried.
He booked a return flight home for the next day.
The plane landed at 11 o'clock in the evening and Ferrell picked up his six-year-old daughter from his father's house and decided they would leave for Ferguson the next morning.
About what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years, a documentary entitled "Whose Streets?" was made, premiered in cinemas on August 11, 2017.
The film is a story of survival and demonstration, love and loss, as well as strength and perseverance from the point of view of the local people who went to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove towards Ferguson with their daughter in a flower dress and a crown matching it, they had another conversation about "what it's like to live black and under what conditions," and they had talked about it countless times before that morning.
"Do you remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers saying to his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't stop taking my daughter with me," Ferrell said later.
"Today's events are... the culmination of events in the past.
My daughter has a right to know that and to grow into it.
He needs to be able to act and organize, but he also needs to know the different layers and conditions of the black experience, and he needs to know what we have to do to be freed, to free ourselves.
Fortunately, though I have been able to protect him from blatant racism, he is still like all the other black girls.
I feel like I would hurt him if I protected him from reality."
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, opposite the police station, which became a campground for activists, waiting for information about the case and finally finding out there would be no charge against the police.
From there, Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to view activism in a new way.
"My activism changed completely after 9 August," he said. While studying at Missouri University in St. Louis, Ferrell was the chairman of the Association of Minority Nurse Students, at which time he focused on food law and health differences in black communities.
"I had no experience of organizing.
Somehow it just happened."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, an assistant director of the documentary, in an evening demonstration.
Folayan said he and photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "just wanted to tell," what was happening.
Ferrelli's mind was squirming with doubt, and he asked: "Do you really want to tell me what is going on, or do you want a story that you can take advantage of?"
The suspicion was based on the countless times that people, usually white people, had appeared in the local community to benefit from its difficulties and perseverance.
"We had heard that those born and raised in Ferguson did not have a common voice," Folayan recently said in an interview. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted Assistant Director Damon Davis, who is known for his activism among sentenced prisoners.
Davis' involvement led Ferrell to join the project together with six other locals, and the film group followed the events during the years that followed Brown's shooting.
"This is not a documentary where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we do," Davis says.
"The most important thing for me was how local people are presented in the film, because I'm shown the same way."
According to Folayan, the intention was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, because it was wanted to show that the popular movement "is not about charismatic leadership, it is about the community", but Ferrell proved to be the most open one to describe.
That's why the documentary shows surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and getting married.
"I felt pretty naked," Ferrell laughs when he tells how it felt to see the film for the first time.
"But I understood that this work and the human imagery of black people require a certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's story goes on to re-focus the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born in the social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the police had shot the black teenage boy Trayvon Martin in 2012, two of the three founders of the movement identify with the Queer identity.
"The leadership of black queer women has kept the whole movement going," Ferrell said. "It's because we have to fight on many fronts all the time.
Black queer women have had to deal with everything."
Folayan agrees: "The movement is indeed maintained by black women, including many queer women."
However, he emphasises that Ferrell was not "self-sustained" because of his queer identity.
"He got the energy moving," Folayan said.
"It's no coincidence, though, that she was on the front line, that black queer women live at the intersection of many things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is transmitted from the screen."
The news crews have long since left Ferguson, but the community and the police are still tense.
Ferrell still has two-and-a-half years of probation left, sentenced for blocking the motorway in a demonstration.
His description of the social political climate in his home parts is brief and succinct: "A mess."
Yet he still trusts the slogan he memorized on Ferguson's streets three years ago:
"Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
All we can lose is our chains."
Suitable resemblance: the artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman gallery in New York has been hung in the middle of the showroom face - white, black and brown faces, between which you can see the resemblance more closely.
These 30 works are portraits made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth prison, where he served his 35-year sentence for leaking classified diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
Dewey-Hagborg's A Becoming Resemblance exhibition was opened on 2.8.2017.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in its work. Manning is a trans-woman and pioneering dissident whose prison sentence Barack Obama eased on the third day of his term of office.
Dewey-Hagborg analyses Manning's DNA algorithmically and, based on his genetic data, created 30 portraits, which are a sharp, albeit a bit theoretical, statement on the customization of DNA data, ambiguities and the underlying cause-effects and identity.
Chelsea Manning, born Bradley Edward, has openly said that she has identified herself with women since puberty and was found guilty in 2013 of 20 crimes, including a violation of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning who was sentenced to prison: a granular, black-and-white selfie, in which an uncomfortable-looking Manning sits in a car in the driver's seat, wearing a platinum-lighted wig that became his signature.
Dewey-Hagborg had a hugely popular Stranger Visions project that he carried out in 2012.
In it he created portraits based on forensic data, which gave him DNA information about, for example, cigarette butts and chewing gums, and created images of what the people involved might have looked like.
Then the artist got an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their story," Dewey-Hagborg said at a new exhibition's press conference.
There was no access to Manning's house and he couldn't be photographed in prison, so the paper contacted Chelsea and asked if she would be interested in making a DNA portrait of Manning.
The artist and his imprisoned muse suddenly became correspondence friends, writing to each other for a couple of years.
They even wrote together a Suppressed Images comic book, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, describing a future in which the president would have eased Chelsea's sentence and had access to the exhibition.
In reality, Obama shortened Manning's sentence just a few days after the comic book was released, a lucky coincidence after seven hard years in a Kansas military prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition will be opened right now, as Donald Trump is waging his own war against information leaks and transgender soldiers, and is finding new ways on Twitter to strengthen the powerful divisions he was actually supposed to ease.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "all things have a purpose."
There is an artist's statement on the gallery wall, and underneath it is Manning's great autograph, with the last name's i point being the heart. In his statement, the artist calls for an end to the "automatic division on which gender, race, sexuality and culture are based."
On the opposite wall there is Manning's DNA sequence: a long line of C, G and A letters written with a pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters - or nucleotide, as the artist's scientific definition is, Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we all are, at least from our biology.
"I hope my exhibition will help people understand that we are equal in genetic heritage and that genetic information is very personal and open to interpretation," Dewey-Hagborg said. His Spurious Memories video work from 2007.
"DNA tells countless stories, 30 of them are on display here."
The final work of the exhibition is in its own room: a page from Manning and Dewey-Hagborg comic book.
In it, Manning's character rises from prison like King Kong, holding a megaphone.
"If they can shut you up, they've won," the picture says.
"Never shut up."
"The text is from a letter I received from Manning," an artist from Philadelphia says.
"It's so impressive that I still get chills."
Unlike the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition, and when Manning shows up, he will be greeted with a face based on his own genetic information, like a bunch of protesters in the middle of the exhibition space.
It's intentional, like everything else in this exhibition: for example, Manning's DNA sequence is written with a pencil at a height similar to his height (157.5 cm).
"The faces were once on the wall, but I wanted to make a crowd feel like them," Dewey-Hagborg says.
"I wanted to film the mass movement that Chelsea created, which was also behind her release."
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted for murder
Police say they have launched a national search to find a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee suspected of stabbing a man to death in a luxury residence in Chicago.
Cook County court records show that on Monday arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56 suspected of being involved in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, who have been issued for first-degree murder without the possibility of bail.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to a local report published by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 27 July 2017.
Police officers alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with multiple cuts in his body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene of the incident and the stabbing is being investigated as a murder, and police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Nortwestern University since 2007.
In a statement e-mailed by Alan K. Cubbage, the vice principal in charge of the university's social relations, Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been denied access to Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal matter that authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University is helping with the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
A statement sent by the university and Somerville College's spokesman via e-mail states that "we have contacted the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigating authorities in every possible way."
The statement also said that Warren's colleagues are shocked and hope that he will surrender.
Anthony Guglielmi, Chief of Information at the Chicago Police Department, said he strongly urges suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"Police have an idea of where they are, and we are constantly improving our search," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities help in the search for suspects.
He said the police received a call from a Grand Plaza superintendent who had received a vague hint that something had happened in 1008.
The police described the vision at the scene as terrible.
According to Guglielm, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered on the same day or earlier.
He said security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," Guglielmi says.
The Grand Plaza board published the following statement to the residents: "Police are currently investigating the course of events and the victim's background, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
He threatened to blow up an Islamic bookstore and "kill Muslims" in London
"I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic," the sentenced man said to the police.
Moffatt must perform 100 hours of unpaid community service.
A 39-year-old man was sentenced for threatening to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and "kill all Muslims."
According to Independent, David Moffatt was sentenced for example for gross harassment.
According to police, the bookstore staff called them on May 23.
According to the staff, the man had "thought to blow up the bookstore and kill the Muslims."
The suspect left the store after the threats.
Moffatt was caught calling the police about threatening him.
The threat had nothing to do with what happened at the bookstore.
Authorities noticed that Moffatt was wearing the same outfit as the suspect in the events at the bookstore, the police spokesman said.
I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic, Moffatt said to the police during interrogation.
As a penalty, a man must perform a hundred hours of unpaid community service and pay £620, or about £690 in legal costs, and £85, or £95 in compensation to victims.
According to Scotland Yard's spokesman, several hate crimes are not reported.
"We will complete the WADA road map in the near future" – Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the activities of the World Anti-Doping Agency's WADA road map to restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission (RUSADA).
"Some of the road map measures have already been taken, and RUSADA was given the right to design and test in cooperation with UKAD, the British Anti-Doping Commission.
The WADA road map has been updated in this respect," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map, which sets out the conditions for re-establishing RUSADA's powers, and the second part of the road map was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that concerns Russia.
"It's all been announced, and it's all going to happen.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future," Mutko added.
One of the points on the road map, however, requires Russian anti-doping officials to publicly accept the results of a study by a Canadian lawyer named WADA, Richard McLaren, who is investigating the state's alleged role in Russian sports doping.
To that, Mutko said: "The investigation is ongoing because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All the measures have been taken.
There were no state programmes, and we cannot admit something that did not exist."
Mutko's words echoed the statement of Vitaly Smirnov, president of the independent Russian public anti-doping committee.
Smirnov, who spoke to the Russian RSport sports media earlier that day, admitted that there have been problems with Russian anti-doping bodies. "We have said several times that the report contains controversial statements and regulations.
We are not going to accept the report unconditionally," he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to stop doping surveillance in Russia in November 2015, after the extent of the doping scandal was revealed.
However, last June it was authorised to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA Director Olivier Niggli visited the RUSADA headquarters in Moscow in July, and after the visit he said the organisation was "on the right track" towards restoring powers.
British organisation skeptical of the innovation that is dear to Finns: "There is no evidence of the health benefits of maternity packs"
The British organisation questions the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packages.
The BBC and the Guardian, for example, say that Lullaby Trust, the organisation that fights SIDS, bans the use of its own brochures in maternity packages distributed in Britain.
The distribution of maternity packages to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, too, packaging is distributed in some areas.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternity package reduces the risk of SIDS.
SIDS means an unexplained sudden death of a baby.
Lullaby Trust is an expert in British health authorities in the safe sleep of a child.
We will no longer allow our official brochures to be packed in them, because it would suggest that we recommend this product, the organization announced.
Finland has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world, just two deaths per 1,000 births.
According to Lullaby Trust, Finland's good reading is the result of a number of different reasons, such as the low number of teenage pregnancies.
Giving each family a box there may be one factor.
But it cannot be said for sure, said Francine Bates, the CEO of the Lullaby Trust.
We are concerned that maternity packages are marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and SIDS.
The maternity package is a Finnish invention, and it has been given to all mothers in Finland free of charge for 80 years.
The package contains various items, such as children's clothes.
This year there are 53 products in the package.
The package itself is a cardboard box where the child can be put to bed.
According to the Scottish government, the boxes it distributes meet all security standards.
Lullaby Trust, on the other hand, says that there is no safety standard as a place to sleep in cardboard boxes.
According to the Lullaby Trust, packaging can be the best option for a place to sleep if there is no crib or cot available.
The organisation recommends using the package only for naps and stopping it when the child is able to turn.
The organisation also recommends keeping pets out of the package and making sure it doesn't get wet or dirty.
The quick villain ran away from the Japanese zoo for the second time
The staff at the Japanese zoo are looking for an escaped tortoise.
The giant tortoise has surprised the staff with its speed and has run away for the second time in two weeks.
The tortoise escaped from Shibukawa zoo in Okayama, western Japan, on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the villain left the zoo via the main entrance.
It won't die immediately because it eats grass around the zoo, but we are very concerned, Yoshimi Yamane, who works at the zoo, said.
The escaped 35-year-old villain is female, 55-pound and about three feet long.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During the opening hours, the villain is allowed to travel freely in the farm area.
The zoo hasn't received any witnesses from a tortoise.
The last escape of the villain took place the other week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking along the road 150 metres from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane said.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups will help your company to avoid Uber's mistakes
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction in her online store start-up company, but the inquiries didn't work.
The answers were often vague, useless or even misleading.
Even though he said the polls were anonymous, some of the employees were suspicious of them.
"The questions were simply not consistent or objective," Errett said. As her haircare company Madison Reed focuses on an online store with 75 employees.
Errett decided to resort to outside help.
More and more new kinds of HR start-ups have come to the market, helping other companies to find out how their employees are doing.
They develop and license software that can measure employee engagement, and companies can make inquiries and target certain teams and groups, provide anonymous notification services to their employees and, in some cases, direct contact with the top management.
"Your health can be monitored with apps like Strava and Fitbit, but where is the company's Fitbit?" asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of the Glint star in Redwood City. Glint offers companies analytics software to measure employee engagement.
Errett has been using Glint's software for three years, and he says he has gained a deeper insight into the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
The programme can be used to make quick inquiries and votes for certain teams, and it can be used to create a map that shows at a glance which departments have the most disgruntled employees and which executives have received the weakest assessments, which has allowed Errett to drill to the core of the problems.
Companies have understood that they have to follow the workplace culture so they don't become the next Uber, and the transport company has been in turmoil since a former employee wrote about a culture of harassment and punishment for those talking about problems on his blog.
For startups like Glint, such neglect is an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance are a global industry, the value of which, according to Let's Talk Payments, can rise to over $118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent, in Denver, Colorado, is a start-up that helps companies detect and prevent inappropriate behaviour, and the interest in the company grew earlier this year when Uber's reputation was hit.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently made a deal with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to make tailor-made inquiries, to collect answers confidentially in real time, and to map problem areas.
In addition, employees can report inappropriate behaviour anonymously via SMS.
And if there is reason to doubt the manager about the indiscretions, the complaints go directly to the company's board.
"General opinion has replaced authorities," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
He points out that if a company treats its employees badly or acts unethically, the consequences can be costly even if the authorities do not intervene; consumers can start boycotting the company, and it can also lose employees and be sued.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has over 25,000 employees at 500 locations, and the company has been using Convercent for over a year because it wants to ensure that the employees are aware of the policies and procedures and can easily contact the headquarters.
In the past, if the employee wanted to report the problem, he had to first find a phone number or email address that could make the notification to the head office, then make an official complaint and hope it will be taken seriously.
"It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience," said James Vitrano, chief of law at Ruby Tuesday, who said it was difficult to follow the complaints made by employees.
In the past, the problems were hidden from leaders working in another city or state, and now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and dealt with more quickly.
"I get a more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the employee's reality," said Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
At the same time, we protect our shareholders from employment-related litigation.
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously after audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of unethical action in the Enron scandal.
Only with social media did the companies realise that they could no longer stop public settlement of their dirty laundry.
"The hope was used as a strategy before technology came under ethical control," Quinlan said.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service that is regularly charged for its use.
It is a business model and an opportunity approved by venture capital investors, and both Glint and Converter have venture capital investors to support them.
Convercent raised $10 million in funding from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital in February, raising $47 million in capital.
Glint received €10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and has raised a total of $60 million in funding.
Investments are not surprising given the links between companies, business culture and venture capital.
According to several studies, employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In a competitive market such as Silicon Valley, good wages, and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they give their time to a genuinely useful company.
"The employees are more committed to the company's success if they like the company and feel that they are being listened to and that their work is rewarding," says Nina McQueen, director of employee reward and well-being, LinkedIn.
Investors get profits when companies succeed, companies succeed when employees commit.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it's no wonder they interest investors.
According to experts in workplace culture, information about employee engagement is important,
But it will be useless if it does not lead to action.
If a company requests feedback from its employees, it can be seen as a sign of change.
And if the change doesn't come fast enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce the employee's commitment.
"If you ask for 4,000 proposals, you have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, CEO of the management consulting company Kotter International, who has seen companies rely too much on just collecting information.
"If the company does not take action, the employees begin to wonder whether they were heard
and whether their opinions matter at all.
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company?"
Errett said Madison Reed is currently conducting monthly employee surveys and is able to tackle the problem on the same day as it is announced in Glint.
When Errett had gathered feedback on the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communication from frustrated employees, he was able to change teams and organise communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday has a better understanding of its employees and hopes that a deeper understanding will help them to improve the long-term sustainability of their employees in a sector known for their high turnover.
"If a company does not commit to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose its employees," Vitrano says.
"If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers there are no companies."
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of secretly filming his naked female neighbour, reports the news agency TT.
A woman living in Gothenburg had come out of the shower at home when she noticed a cell phone hanging from a rope outside her window.
The woman said the cell phone's camera was shooting in the apartment.
The woman who was frightened of the incident had run into another room to dress up.
After the woman had arrived to check the situation, the cell phone was first pulled up, but soon after that was recalculated to the window.
A 20-year-old man suspected of having been filming a woman has admitted to having filmed her.
But he said he only photographed her face.
The video on the cell phone had been deleted and the police had failed to recover it as evidence.
In interrogations, the man admitted the act, but denied he had committed the crime.
The man had justified his description by saying he loved his neighbor as "unfortunately crazy."
According to the news agency, the man is charged with the case.
Teachers demand more money in autumn negotiations
The wage development cannot be lower than in the export industry, for example, but the difference should be narrowed, said OAJ President Olli Luukkainen on Thursday.
A temporary cut of public sector holiday money highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to conclude agreements in which the examination would not involve any holiday money cuts in any way.
In the municipal sector, contracts are expected only after private sector papers have been signed and the percentage increases are clear.
Luukkainen predicts that, for example, OAJ's working conditions have been agreed in January.
Luukkainen did not reveal the percentage targets yet.
Luukkainen is also the chairman of Juko, a public-educated negotiation organisation.
Luukkainen: Holiday money cutting increases earnings development differences
According to OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of employees in the public sector is declining, while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to Luukkainen, fixed-term holiday money cuts further exacerbate the differences in earnings development.
In Finland, it is necessary to define how many students per teacher can be
OAJ also points out that the equality of basic education must be ensured, as the differences between the best and the weak are growing.
According to the organisation, learning outcomes are deteriorating, and differences between both pupils and regions are constantly increasing.
The Bruins player's day was longer as the NBA reduced daily training from two to one
It's almost 11 o'clock in the evening, and a group of UCLA football players have stayed to talk to the other side of the campus's new training fields.
Some have taken off their jerseys, and their backs shine from sweat after the first day of the training camp.
For quite a few of them, this few minutes of chat is a midday break.
After three hours of training, the university's summer-schoolers return to the dormitory for finals, and the next morning they meet at 5:30 at the Wasserman Football Center.
"The next three days will be tough for these guys," Bruins coach Jim Mora says shortly before Monday turns to Tuesday.
The university sports umbrella organisation reduced the number of daily training sessions from two to one, the purpose of the change was to lighten the number of players, but it has extended their days - at least until Friday, when the final exams will be held.
That's why UCLA's first three rehearsals began 15 minutes past seven in the evening, and it was hard to find space from the players' already full schedule.
Limiting training sessions to one a day means that there are more training days than before. The camp started almost a week earlier this year than last year, and this is the first time in the Westwood coach season that has continued through Mora six, when the training is being conducted at the same time as summer courses.
The rehearsals are scheduled to take place 18 times before August 20, when the actual preparations for the season's opening match will begin: UCLA will meet Texas A&M in September.
Mora says she supported the NBA's rule change, even though it made the players' schedules even tighter.
"We load them a lot for three or four days, and that's very challenging," Mora says.
"But the players are ready to work, they're great friends.
I think the situation will get easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA shuts off rehearsals from outside after the camp, which is not easy given the direct view from the training fields to the adjacent parking lot and Luskin Center, a high-quality hotel that has already been bombed with footballs flying over the net behind the goalpost.
The Bruins players are supposed to move to the hotel this coming weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the season when the rooms are available to outsiders.
"We have security," Mora says.
"The worry is that people can book a room and shoot rehearsals on video from there, which is not an exaggerated concern.
The video of the exercises is paid quite a lot.
But we have guards there and in the parking lot.
We're doing the best we can.
I'm not going to overwhelm my head about it.
We have a plan."
Freedom to Rwanda
A presidential election will be held in Central African Rwanda on Friday, the winner of which will be considered clear.
Paul Kagame officially aims for his third term, but in practice he has had an effect on the country's leadership since 1994.
That's when the rebel group RPF ended the genocide organised by extremists.
Kagame was the RPF commander.
Kagame has been criticised for, among other things, crushing the opposition and limiting the freedom of the word.
He has also been accused, for example, of distorting poverty statistics.
For the third term, Kagame will be able to try because the constitution that limited the presidency to two seasons was changed.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a truly considered leader.
During his time, there have been social reforms in Rwanda and international investments have flowed to the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in uniting the country divided by the genocide.
Rwanda's success has led many Africans to ask whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
But Kagame has also promised his people more freedom after the country has been raised to its feet.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook fights fake news by stepping up the fact-checking
Facebook intends to send potential fake news to independent fact-checkers more and more often, and present the results below the original article, announced by the world's largest social network on Thursday.
The company published a statement on its website that it will start using up-to-date machine learning to identify fake news, and possible fake news will be sent to fact-checkers and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticised for being one of the biggest distributors of fake news, and many feel that fake news influenced the result of the US presidential election in 2016.
The topic has risen to political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombed with fake news before the presidential election in May and Germany, which is preparing for the September elections, will support the plan to fine social media networks if they do not quickly remove hostile content.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement published in Germany that fact checks will be tested in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"People want to see which stories do not pass through the screening of independent inspectors, and they want more background information so they can decide more informedly what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager of Facebook news feed in the company's blog.
He added that Facebook will continue testing related articles and will also make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
Origin of a comic book: The Story of a Castle
The small Scottish castle in Kent County is now known as Squeeze's music video and Margaret Thatcher's hideout from the 1970s and 1980s.
But it has 700 years of tumultuous history behind it, and now this castle, located in a charming location in the Bewli Valley, is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired writer who likes old documents.
"I think it's great to be able to study the text written by someone who died over 300 years ago," Rhodes said with a longing.
"I feel a personal connection as I hold the letter in my hand."
The book of Rhodes, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotland from the Middle Ages to the Edvardian era, each illustrated by a different artist, a promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book based on archives, and in 2014 he appeared to be Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, inspired by documents from the British National Library, and the project was emotional.
"I was moved to tears when I noticed a thumbprint in the letter, written by a double agent who worked for the Jacobites in the 18th century," Rhodes says.
"It was his fingerprints!
And the letters smell like smoke, because fire was then used as lighting.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel that he is on the spot.
I love archives!"
An old-timer attracted to documents was allowed to live in the castle for nearly four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the British National Arts Council, which felt too good to be true, admitting that he couldn't stay in the castle without delay a bit longer than would have been hoped.
He spent days studying Victorian "new" castle, archives, treasures and raritys, such as hyena heads hung on walls and bottles in moats for centuries.
He went around the ruins and estates of the old castle and talked with rangers, gardeners and sometimes also the artists who pictured the book.
In the evenings he "took whiskey and started writing."
Scotland's closer history is quite unknown, since the castle was completely transferred to the National Trust only after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived about ten years later, the Foundation's staff were just about to start going through the archive, and Rhodes describes that the archives had been kept for hundreds of years using the same method: taking all the extra stuff to the attic.
There were journals, letters from the times of the British Empire and maps of who owned what. "You could imagine that land disputes are boring," Rhodes said. "But here, families fought about even one birch.
It occurred to me that I think we should let it go already."
Some of the stories in the book go from the castle to the history of England, such as The Labourer, about a man who soon joins England's peasant fiend in 1381.
"Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex says there was a riot in the castle in 1380," Rhodes says.
"The English peasant monkey started in the same area, and it occurred to me that the rebellion could start in a riot.
Maybe these events are connected?"
The rest of the book's stories are closely related to the history of the castle - like The Priest, the story of a priest that Darrell's family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smuggler, on the other hand, tells the story of smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century, who is said to have staged his own funeral by filling the coffin with rocks (it was discovered years later when his grave was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family in Scotney. "The family's men seem to be quite a rascal, constantly getting into debt and buying things they couldn't afford.
The men of the Darrell family solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women, and I see them as handsome guys who could court the heiress."
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about Elämänmäki, a sanatorium in the beginning of the 20th century, where only a eutrophicated plot is left.
Scotland Castle has a special place in his heart.
"It was sad to leave," he said.
"I didn't want to go back to this damn day."
Relations with Russia worst since the Cold War
The relationship between NATO and Russia has deteriorated clearly, commented NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its position in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think it can be said that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War," Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability caused by Russia in eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
But, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to working in such a way that tensions don't get strained.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid the escalation of the situation and the new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump found that the relationship between the USA and Russia has even fallen to a dangerously bad level.
Trump said to thank the Congress for the bad relations between the countries, which approved new sanctions against Russia last week.
Vladimir Klitshko stops - the rematch against Anthony Joshua will not happen
Professional boxing longtime heavyweight champion Vladimir Klitshko ends his career.
Ukrainian Klitshko, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Klitshko, who hit gold, fought 69 times as a professional, winning 64 of the matches.
He held various World Championship titles in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost the last two matches of his career.
Tyson Fury beat him in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitshko met Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost in the 11th round after a wild fight.
Joshua and Klitshko were expected to meet in a rematch in November in Las Vegas.
However, Klitshko did not find motivation for the match.
I purposely spent a few weeks making a decision to get enough distance from the Wembley match, Klitchko said in his statement.
As an amateur and professional boxer, I achieved everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I could never have imagined that I would have such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
See Klitchko's reasons for deciding on the video.
Bernd Bönte, the manager of Klitshko, said in a statement that the decision to quit was difficult for Klitshko.
But he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he doesn't have enough motivation.
That is why this is definitely the right decision, Mr Bönte said.
Klitshko has been dating American actor Hayden Panettiere since 2009.
The couple has one child, Kaya, a daughter born in 2014.
Klitshko's older brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight champion of the world.
In 2008-12, the brothers dominated the World Championship titles of different unions at the same time.
The weatherbreaker in Finland is enchanting the conditions: "Exploring the feeling"
The pole jumper Minna Nikkanen has suffered from the conditions during the summer's iron season.
Minna Nikkanen has had problems with the circumstances.
The wind and the cold have taken the woman from the mood.
Even London World Championships have unstable conditions.
Minna Nikkanen talks about the weather.
The conditions have been in this summer against the pole jumper Minna Nikasta.
I don't want to blame the track, but it was incomprehensible that I couldn't even get the little poles to move properly," Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I've competed and trained here for God knows how many times, and I've never experienced such a fluctuating wind in this place, Nikkanen said at Paavo Nurmi Games.
It has been very difficult to standardise the jump this season, as there have been such unstable winds in the rehearsals, Nikkanen said at the Kaleva Games.
The weather also spoke in London on Thursday.
It has been quite challenging to get the technology together - is it cold jam or what?
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken my breath away.
There is no point in consuming energy under bad conditions.
He got to the World Championships thanks to his hangar jump of 455.
There's been 445 outside.
The situation in London is not the same for everyone.
You have to be patient and wait for better winds.
The goal is to cross on Friday's qualifier 460.
Why don't you move to work abroad?
That won't be necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany from the early season.
I managed to get the jump together and standardize the technology.
I probably should have done the same thing now.
Normally you have been able to train in the hall, now the hall has been closed.
What would be ideal for a race?
It's 25 degrees.
A little wind will do just as long as it's constant.
An experienced ex-officer blunted politicians in Yle: "We have no room for division now and for many years"
Despite the positive economic climate, Juha Sipilä's government must keep ice in its hat and beware of increasing the state budget with debt money, warns Erkki Virtanen, who prepared budgets in the Ministry of Finance for decades.
According to him, there is no room for division.
Yle interviewed a retired Virta in 2015 in Wednesday's First Morning.
The construction of the state budget for next year is just beginning.
Recently, politicians' suggestions about raising the guarantee pension, lowering the car tax and supporting electric bikes, for example, appear to Virtanen as election speeches.
They mainly show that the elections are getting close, because when ten per cent of the state budget is financed with additional debt, we have no room for division now or for many years.
I even think it's a betrayal to talk about the divider when the debt is taken, Virtanen said to Yle.
Virtanen stressed that all debt owed to children.
Virtanen has long experience in preparing state budgets: he started in 1978 at the Ministry of Finance as a budget secretary and then worked as a deputy head of the budget department and a budget manager.
The last time he retired, he served as the Chief of Staff at the Ministry of Employment and the Economy.
In an interview with Yle, Virtanen pointed out that the three per cent growth forecast is likely to be temporary.
All the fortune-tellers estimate that this is a spike from which we will start going down in the next year, and Finland is facing a 1% increase for decades.
Washington amends the rules on permanent residence permit
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that the rules of the permanent residence permit, Green Card, will be changed by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and limit family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans, and the president supports them.
The draft law is to be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars taxpayers' money by changing the way permanent residence permits are issued to citizens from other countries.
It also reduces chain immigration and replaces the current programme.
Applicants who know English and who are able to support themselves and who have skills that benefit our economy will benefit from the new application process," Trump said.
The Danish Queen's spouse does not want to be buried in the same place as the Queen
Prince Henrik doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margareta.
In the picture, Prince Henrik and Queen Margareta were photographed in April.
Queen Margareta of Denmark, 77, and her spouse Prince Henrik, 83, will not be buried next to each other, says the court of Denmark.
Traditionally, the ruling couples in Denmark are buried in the same place.
The Royal House has announced today that Prince Henrik does not want to be buried in Roskilde Cathedral, the Court states in a statement on Thursday.
According to BT magazine, the reason for this is the prince's discontent with his role in the royal family.
It is no secret that the prince has been displeased with his role and title in the Danish monarchy, the court's head of communication, Lene Belleby, commented in the newspaper.
For the prince, the decision not to be buried alongside the Queen is a natural consequence of not being treated as equal with his spouse.
According to the Court, the Queen has long been aware of her spouse's wish for a burial place and understands the decision.
Tragedy on the road: The car almost hit the highway
Tompa had a common-law partner and two small children on board.
They didn't get hurt in the accident, but they won't get the money from the insurance if the other party isn't reached.
The accident happened at Keimolanportti in Vantaa.
Archive photo from Ring III construction site.
Tommi from Vantaa said his family had miraculously survived a car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, her common-law spouse Riina and two small children of the couple drove on the motorway at Keimolanportti in Vantaa towards Hämeenlinna.
A white car that almost drove to the side of the family car drove down the acceleration lane from Ring III to the Hämeenlinna route, Tommi says.
If it hadn't been for evasive action, Tommi would have taken the car with him.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it got out of hand, Tommi says.
The family car hit the railing at a high speed.
The parents and the two small children in the backseat were not injured.
One of the children is just under three years old, the other is under one year old.
Apparently it was pretty lucky that nothing happened to us.
No one who drove by even drove towards us, even though the place was busy with traffic.
The accident occurred about 5:20 p.m.
According to Tommi, no one stopped at them, and the family called 911.
They got out of the car on their own.
The ambulance and rescue department staff showed up, and the family was checked.
The car was ready for redemption.
Tommi says he and the common-law spouse have a low income, and they received family allowance to buy a car a couple of years ago.
Without the information from the other car, the family, according to Tommi, will not get the money from the insurance.
That's why the family wants eyewitness sightings of the car, which is why the family drove into the railing.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take children to kindergarten and work without it, Tommi says.
Tom saw the car was a white, older car.
It was probably from the late 1990s or early 2000s.
He said the car's registration number was started by SIG.
If the culprit is not caught, I don't know how we're doing financially, we're going to have to count every cent today.
Tom hopes that anyone who has seen what has happened or knows something about it will contact the police.
East Uusimaa Police Department and Central Uusimaa Rescue Department confirm that they have had a mission on Tuesday evening at the scene of the accident.
Header and case repaired at 9:15 pm: Contrary to what was originally reported, Tommi said the other car didn't come in the lane of those coming in, but almost drove from the acceleration lane to the side of the family car.
The performance directed by Lotta Jäppinen deals with human relations through humor - The self-expression is seen in the What? theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen, who comes from Kouvola, brings her first-born guidance to the theatre "The One?"
The self-expressor is a musical theatre performance about past relationships and inadequacies.
According to director Lotta Jäppinen, it still makes you feel good.
The subject is handled by means of humor.
There will be no flabby feelings, he says.
According to Jäppinen, the travelling summer theatre performance has been carried out with a tiny budget and a big, young heart.
The title of the performance challenges you to consider what a person reveals about himself as they get to know a new person.
Is he playing a role, or is he approaching the other jacket open?
A plotless act confuses fact and fiction
Jäppinen has both directed and dramatized the performance.
He is also responsible for the lights.
The proposal consists of the working group's texts and has no plot.
The director believes that even though the performance draws young people's thoughts, it speaks to people of all ages.
Jäppinen emphasises that the self-expressor does not directly tell about his own or the working group's relationships.
Fact and fiction are mixed.
I'm sure my own world of values will care about the show.
I don't think that relationships are bad, but I don't think that relationships, especially relationships, are a condition for happiness.
Many learn from divorced parents
Jäppinen believes that the self-detector draws a current picture of young adults living in 100-year-old Finland.
According to him, many have learned a lot about relationships with their parents, many of whom have divorced.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
The performance is played by Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes dresser Ella Snellman.
The fitting of the music is Jäppinen and Roka.
The love of the theatre sparked in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26 from Kouvola, is studying as a theatre expression director at Turku University of Applied Sciences Academy of Arts.
There's two years behind, and there's another thing ahead.
Jäppinen's enthusiasm for the theatre has begun during the years of Kouvola.
The music classes have been raised as an assistant at Kouvola Theatre and played in, for example, the Student Theatre in Helsinki and, most recently, the Linna Theatre in Turku.
The direction has become more and more interesting.
The self-expressor got his premiere last week in Helsinki on Narr's stage.
A 45-minute performance should also be seen in the future, at least in Jäppinen's study town in Turku.
Self-expressionist Kouvola's Who? theatre on August 4, 7 pm and August 5th, 2 pm and 7 pm.
The Finnish Olympic champion recovered from a terrible motocross accident for a year - broken neck
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable force of nature as Janne Lahtela.
The Ace of Kumparela travelled the world for hundreds of days a year for twenty years, chasing his dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but Lahtela's movement continued.
He was not only a tireless intern, but also an experimenter of new species.
There are probably not many forms of exercise on earth that a Kemijärviman would not have tried at least once.
It's inspired me to practice.
There is always something new, says Lahtela.
Finally, one hobby was to stop Lahtela altogether.
In 2014, Lahtela was in a motocross accident.
As a result, his neck and both hands were broken.
I didn't work anywhere.
I licked wounds in my home for a year, says Lahtela.
Lahtela had bad luck.
He also admits that age could have played a part in the accident.
Driving a bike can sound wild.
But I didn't go for boundaries with it.
It's just so tough as a sport that a 40-year-old like this shouldn't get too involved!
After the accident, Lahtela faced a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
Behind was a long start as the head coach of the Japanese freestyle team.
Lahtela started working immediately after her career ended in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be there.
I didn't really do much, says Lahtela.
Even during his training, Lahtela often challenged her protégé in slopes and physics tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was so tired physically and mentally that my own thoughts didn't make sense either.
Not even with the sport.
It was good to be in place.
I actually enjoyed it because for once in real, I just got to be.
A mandatory break inspired Lahtela to become Finland's main coach.
Without stopping, he's afraid he'll burn out.
It is easier to find places in the body that have been broken than intact!
If it hadn't been for the accident, I wouldn't have realized I needed so much rest.
Lahtela started coaching the Finnish freestyle team about a year ago.
About the same time, he found a safer hobby to replace the speed sports.
I switched motocrosses to Frisbeegolf!
It just got out of hand right away.
At worst, I was throwing seven hours a day.
Although Lahtela has always been a super-enthusiastic trainer herself, she does not insist that her coaches be like her.
I'm not forcing everyone into the same mold.
In our sport culture there is room to be different and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and mentality has always been that way, says Lahtela.
Sex robots are coming and we should be worried
It is here: a report on the development of technology in the sex robot industry - just as it had begun to feel that 2017 could not get any weirder.
Yes, it is.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
"We need to start taking the generalisation of sex robots seriously," said the Foundation's founding member and emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence from Noel Sharkey Sheffield University.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingernails.
"Sex robots are squirming, but they're already selling quite a lot, and we're going to see more of them," Sharkey said at the release of the report.
Sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots with the seemingly warm silicone skin and features created with artificial intelligence that resemble human behaviour.
The user can also adapt the robot's own preferences from eye color to nipple shape and fingernail type and color.
Even more worrying is the fact that robots have a "personality" that makes Stepford women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user's preferences, for example to be shy.
True Companion Roxxy Gold robots have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous, and so on.
"Roxxy Gold's personality adapts as fully as possible to the user's personality," the company's website advertises.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
It can be tired, talky or "in the mood."
There are many worrying features of sex robots becoming more common, replacing genuine relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and direct rape fantasies as the user approaches a robot, for example, designed to be shy and resist.
True Companion compares the Roxxy robot to a vibrator on its website:
"Women have a vibrator, why shouldn't men have sex robots?"
But sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their generalisation and development reflects something darker and deeper in our culture: a recession in gender equality towards sexual intercourse, where subjugation is one option among others.
Of course, most men do not acquire sex robots, and their popularity is still marginal, even though the FRR report reported their growing popularity.
However, marginal phenomena tell a lot about the spirit of time.
And a lot of people don't start acting weird or offensive until the market says so.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have started to become more common at a time when women's rights are under threat around the world, and there is a president sitting in the White House who has boasted that he has harassed women.
The Handmaid's Tale is not the most worrying thing about its powerful imagery, such as pictures of hung bodies and excavated eyes, the most disturbing being how realistic the world of the show feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems surprisingly short.
They try to make sex robots as much like real women (with porn stars) as technically possible.
Robot developers want their skin to feel real and their movements to imitate human movements as well as possible.
But their "personalities" are far from reality.
The robot cannot leave the relationship or the situation.
They don't have their own will or history - nothing that points to independence or breaks the fantasy of total submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Slaves.
Police suspect: two terrorist acts were planned in Australia, led by the head of the ISIS
The head of the extremist organisation Isis led an Australian men's group suspected of planning to take the bomb to an Etihad Airways aircraft.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, one of the leading figures in ISIS had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
According to suspicions, the bomb was to be taken to the plane on July 15, but the company was interrupted before the security check.
Police are not going to give any details as to why the company was interrupted.
Another of the suspected terrorists' plans was to build a device to secrete toxic colourless gas and take it to a crowded public place, such as a public transport.
Deputy Australian Federal Commissioner Michael Phelan said that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Based on suspected terrorist plans, four men were apprehended during police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations will also continue.
Trump's perks?
Makes Mitt Romney look like a picture of common sense
In Trump's season, it has already been repeated to the point of getting tired of the fact that the strong division of voters has also broken families up on an everyday level.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, American newspaper advice columns taught how to deal with the relatives who voted for Trump.
We all want to burst our information bubble.
Trump's ability to unite families has been overlooked.
I'm telling you this because my cousin was visiting me in New York this week, a left-wing poet living in Chicago who has long been a button against the Republicans in our family.
He reminded us that a common enemy can have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, my cousins all know, including a Republican-supporting sibling he's been arguing about politics with for decades, are suddenly and suddenly on the same side.
At the dinner table, it is a good thing, but there are significant risks when you think about it more widely.
Trump has given the left-wing power, but the distorting effect of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalisation", we talk about the frightening possibility that one day we won't be able to horrify his tricks.
In the long run, there is an even worse chance that Trump will normalize the Republicans on the right extreme, who, compared to Trump, suddenly seem to be quite reasonable.
Looking back on Mitt Romney's subdued version of madness: dog on car roof, 14 percent income tax (and at least we've seen his tax returns), they look like very minor violations compared to Trump.
When Trump's season is over, the next Republican presidential candidate only needs to be clear-headed, and that immediately feels like a significant improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our children to the Carousel of Central Park, the biggest carousel in the New York Parks Department, and the best you can get in New York for $3 without caffeine.
Karuselli's horses are huge, the characters in the middle - grotesque clowns and the animals in terror looking back - are ominous, and the music behind the background is strangely fascinating.
Many of New York's characteristics will become disillusioned over time: the prospects of high buildings are getting boring, the city silhouette becomes too familiar and the reality of the city is not equal to dreams.
And yet, after 35 years, I haven't been completely over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage but a big roundabout in Northern London, although Ye Old Swiss Cottage is a Swiss-style pub, but it doesn't count.
Central Park's carousel, on the other hand, is still a strangely magical experience, even to the extent that two two two-year-olds, one eleven-year-olds and two women in their 40s enjoy it enormously.
I would have given the carousel a perfect score if someone had asked for my evaluation, but fortunately no one came to ask.
Instead, this week at the department store I was asked to estimate my "payment experience" on a scale from one to five stars before putting my credit card on a reader.
It's the same thing in a cafe in my neighborhood, but there I'm also given the opportunity to combine 15 per cent service money with the estimate, when I go to the counter and pick up the coffee myself.
This slows down everyday interaction and pressures the customer service provider to put their personality in the game in a situation where it is not needed.
The clerk at the department store smiled with regret, as I tiredly gave my credit card experience five stars.
Shefki Kuqi was fired from Inter - "There was no management trust"
FC Inter has today relieved Shefki Kuqi of the team's coaching duties.
Fabrizio Piccaree, who used to be an assistant coach, assumes the coaching responsibility.
The rest of the coaching team will continue in their current positions.
Piccareta, an Italian, has previously served as an assistant coach in Sunderland, for example.
In January, Piccareta, 51-year-old who joined Inter's coaching team, has completed the UEFA Pro licence last year.
Stefan Håkans, Chairman of FC Inter's Board of Directors, regrets what happened.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the trust of the club's management, so there was no other option now, Håkans commented in the club's statement.
Piccareta's contract is valid until the end of the season.
Together with the rest of the coaching team, he is already responsible for the home match against HIFFK tomorrow.
According to information from Ilta-Sano, the team has been in turmoil all over Thursday.
On Thursday morning, Kuqi told the players that the club's assistant coaches Piccaree and John Allen have been moved aside.
Kuqi and Piccareta fought against PS Kem last Saturday in the Inter match.
Linda Lampenius published a youth image from the '80s - would you recognize a serious violin student?
The violin artist Linda Lampenius published a youth picture on Instagram.
Several consternations have been added to the picture, which suggests that the musician is a 16-year-old Sibelius Academy student.
Lampenius himself marvels at the young woman looking seriously at the camera.
A long time ago, serious, he's texting.
If you don't see the picture, you can see it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and also talked about painful topics.
About a year ago, he published a pair of pictures of himself on Instagram.
In one picture he is seen 20 years ago, in the other he is posing now, as the mother of two children.
In his caption, Lampenius ponders his own growth as a person, referring to eating disorders that he suffered from when he was younger.
20 years ago exactly, and today...
I still look much like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I've learned to like myself and how I look, Lampenius wrote.
After the text he had added hashtags to English life, eating disorder, insecure, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating problems in previous years.
She was already 14 years old in the hospital because of anorexia and orthorexia.
A little later, he also became ill with bulimia, which eventually was revealed only in 2006.
The healing began gradually.
In addition to therapy and peering, Lampenius was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was sent from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius has been taken from prison to hospital.
Last year he received hospital care for cuts on his wrists, according to prison officials, after falling in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors complained of the original killing sentence.
He killed Steenkamp during the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting multiple shots through the toilet door in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he thought his girlfriend was a night intruder hiding in the toilet.
The prosecutors have said they are going to complain again because they think Pistorius' six-year sentence is too mild.
The state prosecutor plans to appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court, and the appeal will possibly be dealt with already this year.
If the appeal is accepted, Pistorius' sentence could be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in use in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians illegally camped were arrested in Greece, reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs according to BTV channel.
The police arrested a group of unlicensed campers in Sithonia on the morning of August 1, among the campers were two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
According to TV channel bTV, the State Department later announced that it had released Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened up the rules on free campsites and are already imposing substantial fines on all those who camp outside the designated areas.
The inspections will continue until the end of the season.
The Ministry announced that the court may impose a fine.
Liquid stock sinks - already sunk -7.7%
The oil processor Neste's share has sunk by 7.7 per cent at about 11 a.m.
Its profit before taxes decreased, but exceeded the forecast compiled by Inquiry Financial.
The stock market has started to start slightly on the cold side, both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
Shortly after the stock exchanges opened, the extensive European Stoxx 600 index had dropped by 0.2 per cent.
After about half an hour of trading, the Helsinki stock exchange general index OMXH had fallen by 0.3 per cent to 9509.48 points and the most traded companies OMXH25 had dropped by 0.3 per cent.
The total exchange exchange was 41 million euros, of which nine million were the morning's result publisher Neste.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare in the digestive system.
However, a recent study claims the opposite: a diet rich in meat protein and dairy products may help to relieve irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritated bowel syndrome is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the UK, causing stomach cramps, swelling, repeated or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
People with IRR are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but Washington University researchers found that the essential amino acid tryptophan in the protein helps the body to develop immune cells that strengthen intestinal tolerance.
According to the research director Marco Colonna, immune cells guard from the swamp and ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not enter the body.
Cells that cause inflammation are balanced by cells that strengthen tolerance, protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to the inflammation, the result may be irritable bowel syndrome.
The tests found that the immune cells that strengthen tolerance are found in mice that have a specific bacteria in their intestines.
The bacteria in question need tryptophan to make immune cells appear, and tryptophan is one of the ingredients of proteins.
"We found a connection between the development of the bacterium Lactobacillus reuteri and the development of cells that promote tolerance.
"The more tryptophan there was in mice' diet, the more such immune cells they had."
If the same works in humans, a combination of Lactobacillus reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan can strengthen intestinal tolerance and reduce susceptibility to inflammation.
While studying immune cells that strengthen tolerance, researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one group of mice had such cells, they were not found in mice of the same mouse species that were kept separate from the other group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the microbes in the intestines of mice, the normal gastrointestinal community of bacteria, mushrooms and viruses.
When the DNA of the intestines of mice was examined, six bacterial species were found in mice with immune cells but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri was given to mice that grew up in a sterile environment without intestinal microbes and did not develop immune cells, immune cells began to appear.
The researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system, which raised the bacteria called Lactobacillus reuteri in liquid and transferred small amounts of fluid - without bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells developed into cells that strengthen tolerance.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indoli-3 lactic acid.
When researchers doubled tryptophan levels in mice' diet, the number of cells that strengthen tolerance increased by about 50 percent, and when tryptophan levels were halved, the number dropped to half the previous.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, a person has the same tolerance-enhanced cells as a mouse, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not yet known whether the by-products of tryptophan from Lactobacillus reuteri are causing the cells to develop in humans in the same way as mice, but genetic defects associated with tryptophan have been observed in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
"We probably want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation inside the intestines," Cervantes-Barragan said.
"High tryptophan levels, combined with the reutery of Lactobacillus, may contribute to their spread."
Jose Mournho said Manchester United got a "nero" after signing a contract with Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United got a "nero" after making a deal with Nemanja Matic, a midfielder debuting in Manchester United in a match against Sampdor on Wednesday night.
Matic, who moved from Chelsea with £40 million, began with a 2-1 win in Dublin, the last season of the United before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and he impressed as a defensive midfielder against stars like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic wasn't in the best shape yet, because he wasn't on the Asian tour of blue shirts before the season began, and he did just 45 minutes in the field - according to Mourinho, it has to change before the season begins.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence and thinking make him a genius - he has the natural thinking ability of football," Mourinho says.
"We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later."
In addition to Matic, new arrivals Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were starting the game at Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho began to venerate its starting line-up for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, even though the club has already done a "great job" by acquiring three of his four top players.
"Three out of four - we have to thank the club for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."
Volleyball women teased Germany for two rounds
The Finnish women's volleyball national team lost their fourth match in the World Championship to Germany straight 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
Germany's routine level in gaming is high.
Their game was steady in every sector, according to Finland's chief coach Tapio Kangasniemi in a press release.
In the first two rounds, Finland kept its opponent in a tight position, but in the third round, Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany is leading the block.
When we played patiently and in certain places aggressively enough, we were able to swing along," Kangasniemi said.
The most effective in Finland was Piia Korhonen, who collected 14 points.
Three matches out of four lost Finland will still meet Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: The grand jury has already sent challenges regarding Trump Jr.'s meeting with Russia
In the United States, a grand jury has sent challenges in connection with Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The grand jury convened by special prosecutor Robert Mueller has already sent challenges in connection with the meeting between Donald Trump Jr and the Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya, known for the Kremlin connections.
Reuters, a news agency, confirms the information the Wall Street Journal revealed earlier Thursday about the summoning of a grand jury.
According to Reuters, the grand jury has sent challenges regarding the meeting between Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya, known for Kremlin connections, which was held in the middle of the US presidential election in June 2016.
Also present were Donald Trump Sr's then campaign manager Paul Manafort and his son-in-law, current White House adviser Jared Kushner.
According to Reuters sources, the fact that special prosecutor Robert Mueller has called a grand jury in Washington means a tightening of the pace of the Russian investigation.
Sources add that Mueller wanted a grand jury to assist in an investigation to investigate Russia's involvement in the U.S. presidential election and whether Trump's campaign or his associates cooperated with Russia.
The grand jury extends Mueller's rights to gather evidence, to send challenges and to force people to testify under oath.
A large jury is a group of ordinary citizens working behind closed doors.
The grand jury will weigh the evidence the prosecutor has discovered in the investigation and decide whether the case should be prosecuted.
British inventor microchipd himself to get into his home and car with a wave of his hand
The British inventor has been the first in the whole country to microchip himself so he can open the front door of his home, get into his office, and start his car with a wave of his hand.
The microchip is between the thumb and index finger of 33-year-old Steven Northam, now offering a service to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with the technology of Northam's BioTeq company.
Northam cooperates with Geoff Watson, a medical anesthetist consulting hospital at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, in order to meet the medical requirements of the microchip installation.
The microchip uses a technique similar to that of cats and dogs, and its installation takes only 30 seconds.
Northam's company also turns the locks on houses and cars into compatible with the microchip, and it costs £300 to handle one lock.
Northam is married and has one child, and he has installed microchip technology both in his home and in BMW Z4, which starts when he puts his hand on the steering wheel.
The White House exhibit cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The White House's decision last month to fly a naval helicopter to the White House's southern lawn for an American production show came to cost taxpayers $24,000, as evidenced by military documents received by TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is called Marine One, when the president is on board, as a attraction to an event at the White House on 17 July 2017 where American construction programs were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials visited the products from all 50 states.
In addition to a helicopter built in Connecticut, the display included a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House military agency had requested the helicopter to be present only about 36 hours before it landed on the southern lawn for an "exceptional" event, as shown in the naval HMX-1 helicopter fleet documents.
"I just wanted to make sure you were aware of this because it is an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility," the HMX-1 unit commander wrote in an e-mail the day before the event to his supervisor, who is an assistant commander for the naval flight.
The message said the helicopter would arrive on the southern lawn around 17 July at 7 a.m. and the event would begin at 3 p.m. and the helicopter would not leave until after the grass field was cleared in the evening between 6 and 9 p.m.
In addition, the message said that if the helicopter was delayed leaving the White House, another crew would be needed because of restrictions on service hours.
The original crew was in the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security personnel were at the helicopter when it was on the ground.
It is not clear from the documents received by TIME whether another crew was eventually needed.
The U.S. Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 inquired whether the event was breaking the law.
"One of our questions was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act, and we were told there was no violation," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you can take part," the deputy commander replied.
Made in America was the official event of the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political tone.
At the event, the president spoke out in favour of the health reform that was being discussed in the Senate at the time, as well as in favour of looser state regulation.
The use of Marine One helicopter and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The presidents must use them on their journeys,
but using them only for photos is unusual.
Trump's actions attracted attention in February when Air Force One rolled the presidential campaign event back in Melbourne, Florida, and Trump has strongly criticised the use of his predecessor's presidential plane on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, where American workers presented products made from American materials from all 50 states," said White House press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and train on the southern grass field to bring the president to the White House with a centimetre accuracy.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 training landings for the White House.
According to one official, flights to Made in America were part of the crew's monthly training quota.
The unit's helicopters also flew 11 hours that day in "non-presidential support missions".
According to the White House, the event did not cost taxpayers any other expenses.
Sikorsky's spokesman said the company was not involved in organising a helicopter demonstration on the southern grass court of the White House.
HMX-1 has no records of flights related to the president's duties, and it is difficult to accurately estimate the costs of the event.
According to the Ministry of Defence's 2017 hourly compensations, the VH-3D helicopter's compensation level is $24 380 per flight hour.
According to the documents from HMX-1, flights from Quantico base in Virginia to the White House and back took a total of an hour.
According to the White House, the helicopter's operating costs are clearly lower.
"It is misleading to calculate the cost to taxpayers according to the level of compensation," Walters said.
"The estimated level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called sunk costs that will be taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 study carried out by RAND research company, compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter in the event.
"The idea is to show American production," Spicer said.
"I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they are involved in ensuring national security and that they employ probably hundreds or thousands of people through it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that many Americans have worked hard on.
It is perfectly appropriate to point that out."
It is not certain whether Trump visited the helicopter during the event, but at least he sat down with the fire truck driver.
In the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of them."
Lightning hit Vaasa track - trains have to be replaced by buses
The passenger train traffic between Seinäjoki and Vaasa has been broken due to a technical fault, says Railway Traffic Centre.
Trains will be replaced by buses for the time being.
The failure of the traffic control system was caused by thunderstorms.
The railway traffic centre did not yet have an estimate of the duration of the repair in the morning.
Venezuelan state prosecutor demands the right to block the appointment of a new country's representative body
The Venezuelan state prosecutor has applied for a court ruling that would prevent the appointment of a new representative body in the country.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced that the elected representative body will be appointed on Friday.
In the controversial vote, a representative body was elected to the country, which can, among other things, change the country's constitution.
According to Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega, the decision to block the election has been requested because of suspicions of election fraud.
Ortega has also started an election fraud investigation by voting.
He appointed two judges after the British company that organised the election said the results have been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by Venezuelan authorities was about a million higher than the number of real voters.
Maduro's allies were the only candidates for the congress, and the elected 545 members include Maduro's son and wife.
In addition to changing the constitution, the representatives can break up the opposition-led Congress and change the laws.
Maduro described as a dictator
Maduro's actions are widely condemned.
The opposition sees the reshaping of the constitution as Maduro's way of strengthening its position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called him a dictator.
The European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have announced that they will not recognise the new representation.
Maduro claims that the new delegation is the solution to the country's political and economic crisis.
In Venezuela, the unrest has been going on for months.
Several people have been wounded and over a hundred have died.
Venezuela sank into an economic crisis after the price of oil dropped.
Now many people cannot afford food or drugs.
The opposition is also expected to protest on Friday, when the new representative body is expected to begin.
A Russian man handed over by Finland was sentenced to four years in prison in the United States
The Minneapolis court in the United States sentenced 41-year-old Maksim Senah to nearly four years in jail for involvement in a global computer scam.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of a US demand.
According to Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on holiday in Finland.
He was arrested by the Finnish border authorities when he was returning home.
Finland handed Senah over to U.S. judicial authorities in February 2016, despite Russian protests, reports AFP news agency.
In March of this year he was found guilty of computer fraud that had benefited millions of dollars.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah will be deported after the prison sentence has been served.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs harshly criticised Finland after the arrest and said that the man should not be released to the United States.
In the statement, Finland and the United States were criticised for making the arrest in Finland without Russia knowing beforehand.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury, which infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to fish for usernames and passwords.
The cheaters then used the information by continuing to direct internet traffic, which was used to make click scams and spread spam.
According to Kenneth Blanco, acting director of the Justice Department's criminal department, the case shows that the United States is also able to hunt down other cyber criminals.
We have the ability and the desire to identify, find and bring them to justice, Blanco said in a statement.
Modified at 8:58 a.m.: Corrected for flattening the name of the sentenced person.
Narcos' third-season trailer: Pablo Escobar is out of the picture, so the Cali cartel will take up the lead in Netflix's hit series
Although Pablo Escobar's killer was discovered during Narcos' second season, the Netflix series is definitely not over.
The streaming service has already confirmed that the third and fourth season of the series will be seen. The third season trailer has been announced and will present the new villains in the series.
During the third production season, the DEA has turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the richest drug trafficking organisation in the world.
The organisation run by four godfathers is "like Fortune 500", except that there is a little more corruption and violence among the authorities.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) runs the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brains, with Pacho Herrera (Albero Ammann) connecting with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operating in New York.
In a recently released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peñana, who recruits U.S. and Colombian police to fight drugs.
New faces include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
Narcos' third production season begins on 1 September.
Kari Kola will perform an exceptional work of light art in Paris
Joensuun light artist Kari Kola (in Kuavssa) will perform an exceptional work of light art in honour of the UN's first Light Day in Paris next May.
Kola is doing a work of light art in Paris called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The UNESCO headquarters Fontenoy building and the Globe monument in front of it are illustrated in the work.
I want to highlight not only the light but also the darkness with my work.
Today, light pollution from millions of cities is a major problem that affects the well-being of all of us.
With the help of my art, I can make the things I feel important concretely visible, says light artist Kari Kola from his work.
I'm very impressed with the invitation to be part of the first international Light Day and to bring light art into the theme day, Kola continues.
Kari Kola attended the opening of the Year of Light in 2015, when he lighted UNESCO's headquarters to celebrate the holiday.
I feel very privileged to re-enact my art at UNESCO headquarters, Kari Kola says.
The work may still expand significantly.
This will be announced later in the coming autumn, Kola will continue.
The goal of International Light Day is to highlight the importance of light for mankind and to raise people's awareness of fields of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first Light Day will be celebrated at UNESCO headquarters in central Paris on May 16.
Two men fought in a shopping centre parking garage in Espoo
Two men got into a fight in Espoo in a shopping centre in the Big Apple parking garage on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute began when the other party accidentally drove in a forbidden direction.
There was a verbal argument between the drivers.
The driver, who drove in a forbidden direction, swung at the driver of the other car, as a result of which his car started to move, hitting the hitter's car.
After that, he hit the hood of the car that still crashed.
In a preliminary interview, the man has admitted that he has caused the damage and has done wrong.
An article titled from Timo Soin with a question mark: "After that there was a flood"
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (U.S.) published a blog post on Thursday, titled by a question mark.
The article is short, only two sentences long.
During my time, the party grew from zero to a government party of thirty-seven MPs.
After that there was a flood, now everything floats, Soini writes.
Soin's text contains references to 18th-century France.
King Louis XV or his mistress, Madame de Pompadour, is known to have used the flood metaphor.
Depending on the interpretation, the words "after us" or "after me" have been left in the history books.
According to the UN, Afghanistan's democracy depends on women's political role
The elections will only be representative if all members of society, including women, can vote in them, said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
The interim director of the UN relief mission, Nicholas Haysom, said there were hundreds of women in the elections to the provincial councils, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"You can't overemphasize the role of women," Haysom said in a statement on Wednesday.
The elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan provincial council and presidential election will take place on 5.4.2017.
Taliban has made threats about the elections at the same time as international troops are moving into an advisory role.
This year's elections will be the first time that power is transferred peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said women's contributions will strengthen democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Election Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

A flood of certain types of tourists threatens the region's culture
Authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
Local rage is especially directed at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it "eat and flee" tourism: the destination is only a few hours away and the big crowds rush through the sights.
Venice is smothering the tourists making quick day trips to the city.
It is difficult to move on narrow streets, and the fine squares are so full of visitors that the residents of Venice can no longer fit in.
They have been forced to move further away from the historical centre, while hotels have replaced their homes.
The New York Times and The Guardian write about the problems of tourism in Venice.
Authorities are considering restrictions on the number of tourists.
They call the current phenomenon low-quality tourism - low-quality tourism.
When you arrive on a large cruise ship, you give two or three hours.
You follow the flag guide from Piazzale Roma to Rialto Bridge and St Mark's Square, and you turn back, describes Italian Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini's current and problematic tourism.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operations of the place, shops and workshops.
We must keep this part of the identity of the cities.
St. Mark's market is also one of the most popular places to visit in Venice's historic centre.
On the edge of the market is St. Mark's church.
Local anger is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
Only 50,000 locals live in the historic centre of Venice.
In 1951 there were about 175 000 residents.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians protested against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroys the environment and drives the residents away.
About 2,000 people leave every year.
If this continues, in a few years there will be no more than tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says Carlo Belframe, who organised the demonstration.
The equation is difficult, since the ships bring to Venice the income it desperately needs and create a need for a number of different jobs in different sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, it has been planned that cruisers would move further away from the historic centre.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, thinks the situation would certainly change if Veneto's administrative district, where Venice is also located, had more power to decide its own business - if not full autonomy.
Every year, about 20-30 million tourists visit Venice.
Are you driving in Kuopio?
Traffic jams over miles along the motorway
On the motorway between Kuopio and Siilinjärvi, there has been traffic congestion on the north lane during the return traffic during Thursday afternoon's work.
There is motorway paving work in the area, which slows down traffic, says Savon Sanomat.
There is a speed limit of 50 kilometres per hour for road work, instead of the normal speed of 120 kilometres per hour.
Even in a restricted area of 50 kilometres, traffic had, in practice, progressed in some places during Thursday afternoon.
On Thursday afternoon, road work progressed on the Siilinjärvi side of the statue of Apparition, the golden goat.
I get along well without that kind of attention
A 23-year-old runner has had to notice the curses of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has published amazing pictures of herself in the Grand Canyon landscape, for example.
The Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has become a popular athlete in Norway in her current home country, not least because she broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in a 400-metre race by going around the track round on 51.81.
A month later, he improved the 400 metres fence race during Norway's record 55.38.
Iuel, who is hard-working in social media, soon after his record, found that fame and publicity have their downsides.
The men around the world began sending pictures of their genitals to Iuel, apparently in the hope that the young runnerswoman would be interested in them.
Iuel had to close his Snapchat account to outsiders.
I got a lot of "stupid pictures" from people I didn't know, so I had to turn my account into a private one, Iuel told VG.
In an interview with VG, Iuel did not want to identify exactly what kind of photos he got.
You can guess, Iuel laughed.
It's nice to get feedback after the run, but I'm fine without that kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, his father is Danish-Norwegian.
Iuel's family moved to Norway when Amalie was 2 years old.
When Amalie was 12 years old, the family moved to Namibia first because of his father's work, then Pakistan.
It was followed by Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, from which he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains under the guidance of three coaches, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to discussion than the United States.
In the United States, coaches don't ask questions but only give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to deal with the athlete personally," Iuel said to VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norwegian records for 400 metres and 400 metres in a fence run.
The foot injury put the snowboarder Janne Korve at risk - now involved in the World Championship: "It's nice when it doesn't hurt anything"
Now it has been nice to count when nothing has happened!
Janne Korpi, 31, one of Finland's most successful snowboarders, has really enjoyed his beloved sport again this season.
Last summer, the career extension was still at stake.
The stress injury on the foot had forced Korve to the operating table in January, and there was no way the leg would get better.
The hand had also hit the race slope.
During the summer, I had no idea what I was doing, whether or not the boarding will continue.
The sponsor deals were off and a lot of things were open, Korpi says.
But that's what they say, things tend to work out.
The leg improved, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood began to draw back to the slope.
After that, it was an easy decision to make.
I knew that at the latest when I first went to the snow.
I was like, hell, this is so much fun, let's just do it a couple more times.
Raven didn't get to count properly until September-October, but after a long bill break, just working out as painless has been a big deal.
Kisoja Korpi has only passed a few.
It doesn't matter.
The competitions have never been the most important aspect of the ferrying for Korve.
I've never counted for one race.
I think it's frustrating to aim four years at one competition, and then you're going to be feverish for that week.
I'm tired of thinking like that, Korpi says.
Today, Korpi is racing in the halfpipe of the World Championships in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Even though the individual races don't hold him on board, he always lights up when he's in tough company.
According to Korve, the international ski federation has grown in value over recent years, even though some of the boarders chose the Norwegian X-Games to be held at the same time.
Yes, this is an important competition, the visibility is big.
But I always think appreciation depends on the circumstances and the level of the games.
In Sierra Nevada, Korpi is the oldest athlete in Finland's 12-person team.
The team's coops, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger than Korpea.
It's nice to watch the younger guys go.
I remember when I was at the point where everything was new and was so sickly excited about everything.
It will give you new power, Korpi thinks.
There's still some way I can keep up on the slope, but otherwise I don't, that's the amount of power in my friends!
Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career in the background of the boarding career.
The coach legend Pekka Korve's son is addicted to race sports: the boarder has his own racehorses for whom he makes training programs.
When I'm on the road all the time, there's no time to be in the mess.
But every day I look at at least the nutrition results and usually some departures, Korpi says.
According to Korva, ravishing and nutrition coaching are a potential career plan when the boarding career comes to an end.
I don't want to plan that far, but at least it's a likely option.
I feel like I'm studying it here along with snowboarding.
I try to stay on the edge of time and develop, maybe even drive some departures in the summer.
If it's my future profession, it won't be hard to start when you're already inside the sport.
The ravi stories also include the Elitloppet event organised with the host Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The two have rented a cruise ship that will head for the Elitloppet restaurant in Stockholm in late May.
Raven and Linnonmaa decided to revive the old tradition.
The cruise has gone well, and people have been excited.
We are already at the point where at least there will be no bankruptcy.
There is still a few months, let's hope we can fill the ship, Korpi says excitedly.
Attendo's nursing home project for Kitee has surprised everyone
Attendo Ester is the name of a new 41-seat care home for older people to be built for Kitee.
The building of 1 700 square metres of floor floor area is expected to be completed next summer across the health centre's neighbor's Health Road.
The general wonder about Kitä is where there are customers for the new treatment unit, because now, during the Siu wars, many private nursing homes are experiencing a shortage of customers.
Anne Flink from Attendo, regional director of nursing services, commented that in the future, Kitee will have more demand not only for options but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are options, freedom of choice works better, Flink says.
Last year Attendo bought private nursing homes in Kite, Kanervikkola and Eerikka.
The deal was about business, but there is a five-year lease on real estate reportedly.
Flink says Attendo doesn't have an acute need to move operations away from these premises.
More on the subject later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of McVitie's brand Scottish plant
The trade union seeks confirmation from the leaders of McVitie's cookie maker for a long-term commitment to production at Glasgow plant.
According to the Scottish department of the GMB, the company has not told about its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
There are over 500 employees in the Hobnobs and Rich Tea and other products factory.
Pladis, a company that owns McVitie's brand, said it invested more than £5 million in the plant in recent years.
The company added that employees and trade union representatives will "be sure to be the first to be told" if there are changes in the operations.
In a letter addressed to the factory manager, GMB urges the company to "reply concerns about the lack of funding for the modernisation of production lines."
The GMB trade union's Drew Duffy finds it extremely worrying that the plant manager does not provide clear information about Tollcross's business needs and future investment plans.
"Families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce has focused heavily on the local community and Glasgow metropolitan area, a major source of employment in the area of high unemployment and low income.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and livelihoods, and Brexit, rising cost of living and the constant reduction in production, the East Glasgow desperately needs successful McVitie's production."
According to Pladis' spokesman, the plant manager had received a union letter only the day before, and the company responds directly to the letter because it appreciates constant interaction with employees and union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, when we discussed several questions openly.
We discussed with employees, among other things, that, like other companies operating in highly competitive and uncertain markets, we constantly assess all our business operations and offices in order to maintain our competitiveness."
According to the publicist, the company has invested more than £5 million in Tollcross plant in recent years, especially in its production lines and improved operations.
"We are aware of Tollcross's long history as a plant, and we will certainly be the first to tell employees and trade union representatives if we are to make changes to the plant's operations."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's transfer three years ago?
LaLiga may regret his interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up on Neymar after paying £189 million to close the contract, but did PSG warn Barcelona of a record transfer three years ago?
The sensational move is the most talked about event of the summer, and the French League 1 football team is ready to break the world record of settlements, the previous record being less than half as low as it was when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a £89 million transfer.
After the transfer, Neymar will be the world's most expensive footballer and also the world's best-paid professional athlete, since PSG offers him over £500,000 a week after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be furious about PSG's actions and the way Neymar has forced his way out of the company. A source near Barcelona says the company has been taking very good care of Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the PSG president warn the football world about this transfer three years ago?
When Manchester City announced its interest in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned PSG's best players clubs.
"I'm not worried, because they know that if they want our players, we will be their opponent and contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they want our players, they will have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have done just that: it expressed interest in PSG's midfielder Marco Verratt earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances, and it may well be that Barcelona will lose its star player Neymar as a result.
Neste blocked the stock exchange - Stock exchange news - Ilta-Sanomat
Metsä Board, the second big result promoter of the day, fell more gently.
The extensive European general index Stoxx 600 had risen by 0.1 per cent when Helsinki closed.
The Helsinki stock exchange general index OMXH rose by 0.1 per cent to 9542.08 points.
The OMXH25 of the most traded companies progressed the same.

In the change tip, Nokia went up 0.3 per cent to EUR 5.51.
The next oil processor, Neste, packed 5.1 per cent.
The company's profit before taxes weakened, but exceeded the forecasts.

Now: Trump's phone calls were made up - White House spokesman: "I wouldn't say it was a lie"
The White House admits that two calls mentioned by US President Donald Trump never happened, reports the New York Times.
Trump's smoking calls with both the Mexican president and the head of a Boy Scout organization have proved to be made up.
White House spokesman Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that there had been no calls.
But he said Trump wasn't lying.
According to Sanders, many of the scout leaders spoke to Trump personally, and Trump, with Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto, had spoken at the G20 meeting in Hamburg.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty big accusation.
Those conversations happened, not just on the phone, but in person, Sanders explained.
A speech to Boy Scouts sparked disapproval
On Monday, Mr. Trump said the President of Mexico called him and praised Mr. Trump's success in eliminating illegal immigration.
Mr. Trump said Pena Nieto said that few will cross the southern border of Mexico any more, because they know the journey will be blocked to the US border anyway.
On Wednesday, the Mexican government published a press release saying that there was no such call.
On Tuesday, Politico published a complete version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
In it, Trump praised his speech at a large meeting of the National Scout organization in West Virginia.
I got a call from the Boy Scout leader, he said it was the greatest speech they've ever had.
They were very grateful, Trump said.
On Wednesday, the Boy Scouts' Association announced that it is not aware of a call from any of its leaders to Trump.
According to the press release, Michael Surbaugh, the director of the organization's earlier statement, in which he had apologized to the Boy Scouts for Trump's speech, speaks for himself.
Trump's speech at the Boy Scouts' Association's meeting caused a lot of confusion, as it was exceptionally political in nature.
Among other things, he praised the results of last autumn's presidential election.
