28-year-old chef found dead in a shopping mall in San Francisco
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the steps of a local shopping centre this week.
But the victim's brother says he doesn't know anyone who wanted to hurt him, saying, "It finally went well for him."
The body found at Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old Sanfranciscola Frank Galicia, said the San Francisco coroner's office.
The San Francisco Police Department said death was defined as a homicide and an investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's channel KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously served as a line chef in Boston, had had his dream job as the head of the San Francisco restaurant Sons & Daughters six months ago.
Sons & Daughters said they were "horrored and shocked" because of his death.
"We have a small team that acts like a close family and will be very missed," the spokesman said.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said Frank was staying at the hostels at the beginning, but recently "his things finally went well."
"He found an apartment and was seeing a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was benevolent and had a big heart.
His way of feeling united with the family was to cook us dinner, make dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of dispute.
He was a brother who drifted with the flow.
"In a world where so many things are wrong, he was an uncut diamond that shone brighter every day," he said.
Anyone with information is asked to call the San Francisco police hotline 415-575-4444.
Medical interns on strike: Requirements for new industrial action
Representatives of doctors' interns have asked their trade union to approve new industrial action in their dispute over the new contract.
The British Medical Association (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) calls on the Council as a whole to support new industrial action from the beginning of September.
JDC says the ministers have failed to address concerns about the deal.
In July, doctors interns and medical students voted to reject the contract that had been agreed with BMA.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of the members who voted.
On Thursday evening, in a letter published via Twitter to members, JDC chairman Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "constantly silent" about the issues that he said led to the rejection of the contract.
He said: "In this light, the JDC government has voted to completely reject the proposed new contract and to call for formal renegotiations of all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC government has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to obtain a mandate for a progressive and expanding industrial battle programme, beginning in early September.
The dispute has resulted in doctors who have participated in six strikes this year, including the first complete stoppage in the history of the NHS health system.
The director of BMA doctors' interns, Dr Johann Malawia, resigned after the vote had rejected the terms of the contract, recommended by BMA.
He had told members of BMA at meetings before the vote of 54,000 doctors interns and students that the contract was a good one and should be approved.
After the vote, health minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be imposed on doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an outside alliance?
A gesture that ended in a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare the eight-month battle of words and economic sanctions officially over.
But as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg's palace, I got the clear impression that Ankara wants more of this reconciliation.
Yes, there was a shakedown at the event.
But Putin's smile looked forced, and he didn't have much heat, even according to his own subdued standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, kept talking about his "loving friend" Putin - five times according to a report.
I lost count.
He also swore that relations with Russia would return not only to pre-crisis levels, but even better.
The next day the newspapers here described Erdogan as acting like nothing bad ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm reflected the opposite.
But the coolness from Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the reason for the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening statement: when Turkey shot down a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at that time was furious.
Putin attacked Ankara for stabbing Moscow in the back.
The insult was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media led to an amazing, thorough attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were responsible for everything.
The most serious were the high officials' accusations that Erdogan's own family has benefited from the illegal oil trade in Syrian areas controlled by Isis.
He has strongly denied this.
But the official message in St. Petersburg was that it is time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Mr Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia won some kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of agreeing a truce are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost removed from power in last month's failed coup.
The continued terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia's economic sanctions have been heavy, especially a ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has dropped by nearly 90 per cent.
With regard to Russia, local tour operators and charter airlines will certainly be relieved when the flights eventually continue.
They're hoping for a late season to rush to the Mediterranean.
And already this week, the state television has predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables after allowing agricultural imports from Turkey again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as the Vedemost newspaper report said.
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
In Ankara, people are angry at the West for what is considered a weak response to the attempted coup.
Adding a long-standing grudge about the snail's pace of EU membership negotiations, Putin, who is eager to exploit coolness and break Turkey's ties with the West, will emerge.
The Russian leader certainly got points from Ankara, where he called after the revolution attempt to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is for sure for Moscow, which has its own deep-seated fear of a change of power.
So this meeting at the Prattian Sea Palace allowed Russia and Turkey to introduce a "outside association", as one analyst described it to me: two countries that felt they were abandoned and mistreated by the West, to join forces.
However, these two have major differences despite public reconciliation.
The key issue is Syria, where Moscow has recently adapted itself to the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It may be telling that after nearly three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even discussed the matter.
The Turkish President deliberately avoided answering the question about their differences, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can look for a common basis for Syria.
After months of open hostility, and considering the possibility of a full disaster as NATO member Turkey shoots down a Russian fighter plane, it is certainly better that two leaders are even talking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear from customers outside Scotland
According to the bank's CEO, the RBS brand will be reduced to a back office role.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's international goals.
Since the bank nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved, it has abandoned these goals.
Bank strategists have used the RBS brand to protect other consumer finance brands during this time.
It was supported by millions of pounds of international sports sponsorship, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to allow more national brands to come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is in use with Scottish customers, but it will not be restarted.
In England and Wales, all RBS references, with the exception of headquarters and stock exchange listings, will be converted into NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use for customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that get more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed on a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will be our investor brand and employees' employer, because we will now become much more a brand bank."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say we no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in its own communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already said it will not continue to sponsor Six Nations, and it has raised the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to move in the direction of the brand bank, because basically (we've asked questions) it's about how we can focus on making this a better bank for customers," the CEO said.
Three years ago I would have been very cynical if we had said we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we have done focused on customers' needs, not our own, I think you will see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins in Newmarket with Predilection and wins 3,000 wins
Dettori sprays champagne after a double win with a total of 3,000 wins
Racer Frankie Dettori secured his 3000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached the milestone in his second victory of the evening on his home track, competing with John Gosden's coached Predilection.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who earlier won at Ghayyar, said: "This is special."
I'm very emotional, because my family is also here.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket, because here I started 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not Royal Ascot, it's an ordinary Friday night and 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
Dettori absorbs cheers when he brings Predilection out after victory.
Two riders have reached this milestone in the obstacle competition - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 wins in his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggot, 9-time Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best riders in the current era, and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have achieved before him.
He is stylish and strong, but his tactical wit separates him from others in the weighing room.
He is a great ambassador to the competitions, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to the sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have rode 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a jockey for weekends and big games!
Speaking seriously, Frankie has been riding winners in the UK for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He is a lively person who is a good thing for the British competition, but he is also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated a milestone with a sled landing from a saddle formed into a trademark.
From flying endings to flying landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British racing for two decades.
This has been a roller coaster.
A lot of winnings in the big games, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' win in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived the plane crash and suffered a ban on drugs.
Three years ago, he had a hard time coming back after six months of a ban, but he showed significant strength of character in challenging the sceptics and returning to his best condition.
And he may continue for a long time - Dettori has previously said he would like to continue competing until at least 50 years of age.
Russian Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov resigns
Russian President Vladimir Putin has suddenly dismissed Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed special representative for environment and transport.
The Kremlin statement said Mr Putin had "ordered Mr Ivanov to move away from the leadership of the Russian presidential administration", but he was given no reason.
Ivanov's Deputy Director since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital, Tallinn, in 2012, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later he led the president's protocol and government staff, said on the Kremlin website (Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the most important task of the administration is to support your actions as head of state as regards drafting laws and managing the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended that Vaino be replaced.
Are smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like Putin, served as a Soviet security service in the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a state television meeting with President Putin, both men claimed that the chief of staff withdrew at their own request.
But despite smiling at the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is this just some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that the man once advertised as a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy has been received with real scepticism.
In his comments to Putin quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said: "It is true that early in 2012, I asked you in the discussion to give me this very complicated, even laborious, task for four years.
Well, now I've been Chief of Staff for four years and eight months."
Ivanov approved the mission in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service of the KGB, as well as Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the FSB, which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy director.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
On one occasion, it was thought that Ivanov could become Russian President Puti after the second season, since Puti's third season would have been unconstitutional.
However, this mission went to another close ally of Putin, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before returning to office only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson was fired after hitting the producer
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute last month at a series set in Los Angeles.
The series of producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who acted as Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
There were creative differences and quarrels on the set.
I regret that it happened," he said in his statement.
According to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how Gibson's character will be removed from the series of FBI agents' team are expected later.
The 54-year-old who previously starred in Dharma & Greg's sitcom has been in the series since its first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds, and I've given it everything I have for the last 12 years," Gibson said in a statement published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that is not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our incredible team and, above all, the best fans the show can have.
The beginning of the 12th season of the series has been planned for September 28.
Mystery fish ended up in a garden in Banff
A man living in Banff has asked for help in identifying the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be windfish left behind by a whirlwind.
Bain, 500 metres from the sea, released film material from the revelation in Periscope, hoping someone could bring clarity to the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now extends to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern deck of Queensferry's overpass and the land bridge, which means that the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of the four locks between the "folders" that are now about to be completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 harus ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Finance Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry's overpass.
We are all witnessing truly impressive engineering work in this project, where over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel have been used alone to build this bridge section."
Despite the huge size and weight of the bridge, the closing of the bridge-to-bridge closure is a demanding operation, in which extreme measurements should match.
All in all, nearly 79% of the bridge deck is now in place, and the final piece of the deck will be cast in Rosyth today, which means the whole deck will be ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of Fort Crossing Bridge Constructions, said: "The first shutdown in any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this shutdown represents the top of the building technology.
After the last section of the road deck was installed and connected to the expanding northern pillar road deck, we had to close the remaining section from the north, that is to say, from the inland side.
This was done by pulling the northern fairway bridge 700 mm southwards.
This was a huge and at the same time very demanding measure.
Huge, because the land bridge is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled at an angle of inclination of about 3%.
Requisite, because the tolerances that the team worked with were tiny, just a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Salvation at Moelfre Bay: Three men are "lucky to be alive"
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after they fell from their fishing boat outside Anglesey.
The rescue boat station Moelfre RNLI alerted at 1.20 pm (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event develop in the Bay of Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety as their boat moved on by itself.
"We saw the boat moving closer to the men and imagined the worst," said Moelfre's lifeboat helmman Vince Jones.
"I'm glad the strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got moving," he added.
The local fishing boat rescued two of the men, and the third man, 60 years old, was found exhausted hanging from a buoy without life jackets.
The men were taken to a coastal rescue boat and brought back to the rescue boat station.
Jones said: "These three men in the water are lucky to be alive and completely undamaged.
The boat's engine had a kill switch on it, but it was somehow detached from the person driving the boat when the boat crashed.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectful hunt for health and happiness
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many have been worried that teenagers and children are no longer going out to play, but that they prefer to spend their free time watching screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get off the couch and take part in some activity.
The screen time was originally limited to television, then video games, and now, recently, smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activity are not mutually exclusive.
I am referring, of course, to a fad called Pokémon Go, an app based on characters originally developed in the 1990s for video games (later they created a cartoon series, cards and other sequels).
Like many pop-culture phenomena, its popularity was somewhat weakened before this new game was released in the United States, Australia and New Zealand early in July.
After that, the release of the game in other countries was delayed, as huge popularity overloaded the servers.
Only in days Pokémon Gola had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
When explained in a nutshell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémons that are tracked using GPS and that can be "photographed" (via phone screenshot) or "caught" after discovery.
The generation that played the game when they were younger has joined the fad and jumped from the couch to join the search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the daily steps of the "average person."
Apple Watch app Cardiogram, which follows 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of the game release, the number of people moving 30 minutes a day jumped from 45 to 53 per cent in users followed by Cardiogram.
The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Gota, it only sees the training level information.
The calls from many public health campaigns to "find 30", "get off the couch" and "be active every day" have not produced any results because most public health warnings are boring and cared for by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
Regularly moving people have a lower risk of developing cancer or depression.
Activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure and diabetes, and its benefits are too diverse to be listed here.
The beauty of Pokémon Go is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even make new friends as they hunt.
As usual, disgruntled pranksters are looking for things to complain about.
Yes, someone can walk to the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Even though there used to be apps like Fitbit that could monitor activity, they didn't give reason to move the way this game did.
The novelty will disappear, and the use will eventually subside.
However, because of Pokémon's success, there will be other games that combine applications and virtual reality with real world activity, helping many hunting people to be more active, better condition and healthier.

Simone Biles grabbed gold in a women's gymnastics multi-match
Forget the pressure.
Forget the publicity noise.
Simone Biles is immune to it all.
Energic on jumps.
Smooth on the beam.
I can't believe it on the floor.
Brilliant everywhere.
And now, in the end, the Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old American gymnast won a multi-match championship on Thursday, leaving the gap between himself and the rest of the world to the Olympic spotlight.
His total score, 62.198, was clearly better than the silver medalist and the "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Alya Mustafina.
At the U.S. Simone Biles balance bar, women's gymnasium in the multi-match finals of individuals in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American woman who has successively won the multi-match championship and, overall, the fifth American champion, and at the same time strengthened her reputation as the best of her generation, and perhaps the best of all time.
She burst into tears when her final score was announced, and her long journey toward this moment ended.
This achievement brings him to the same level as other best athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their sport to a new level:
Biles has dominated his sport for the last three years, winning 15 World Championship medals, including 10 gold, with programmes that have been so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
The final test was in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and other competitors as between him and the burden of oversized expectations.
Returning to the family home in Spring, Texas, without a handful of gold medals would have been disappointing.
US Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hug after winning the gold and silver medal (in this order) for women's gymnasium in the multimatch of individuals' finals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday, Aug.
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday as he culminated in the departure party of Martha Karolyi, the national team's retired coordinator.
Even though Biles claimed that he has never thought about the future as he goes his long way to the top, it is not entirely truthful.
Some of his permanto - the one with his trademark volthohitus - has been adapted to Latin American music, which would be perfect for the street next to the Rio Olympic arena.
This is not a coincidence.
This girl, who was adopted as a toddler by her grandparents, and found by coach Aimee Boorman's mother when she was on a field trip to the gym where Boorman trained, has become a powermaker.
He hasn't lost in a multi-match since summer 2013, and this winning streak should last as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafina was in a small lead after two laps, it was just an illusion.
The balance boom and the permanto, where Biles is the reigning world champion, waited.
He took the lead at beam points 15.433 and crossed them with 15.933 permanto.
Raisman hugged him benevolently as they waited for the final points - just a formality - and tears rose to Biles' glitter-red, white and blue limited eyes, when the dream he once wrote about in his scrapbook became a reality.
Raisman's performance was some kind of rematch from four years ago, when he was in divided third place, but lost the bronze to Mustafina in the renewal.
This time the 22-year-old team leader, whom the Americans call "grandmother", was clearly in charge.
He sent kisses to the audience after his perm performance in an emotional rush for a return that at times seemed questionable.
As far as Biles is concerned, this 19-year-old's widespread tweeting earlier this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in a serial murder were shot while listening to music in the car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the most deadly attack in Phoenix's first serial killer case in the last decade were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, as reported in a police release published on Thursday.
Authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked in the driveway on June 12.
The report says that the shooter standing on the passenger side of the car fired a handgun up to eight times and then escaped with another vehicle.
Police say the triple homicide does not appear to have been the result of the robbery, since the attacker did not take purses or $2,900 from another adult victim.
A Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said the shooting caused the investigators to examine whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
Seven people have died and two have been wounded in the nine attacks that took place in four months, mainly in Latin American districts.
"These are happening in the residential area in front of the home," Howard said earlier this month to CBS subsidiary KPHO.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, such as the late 1990s brown Nissan, the late 1990s black BMW, and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The researchers have refused to reveal evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks are related and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.
An eyewitness told the police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police announcement about the shooting that took place only half an hour before the triple homicide, targeting an empty pickup truck, which is also believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Researchers found bullet casings, bullet in the seat and bullet fragments in the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It gets easier"
Edmund Picciuto, like most of the other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But, unlike most of his peers, Edmund is small-headed, a result of a genetic disorder his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know about when she was pregnant.
"When he first came home, my first idea was that I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for this.
Which is not at all true - of course I promised," he said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never learn to recognize them, and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was 'I didn't know people were still doing it'," Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with a walker.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
But he slowly reaches some milestones.
He walks assisted and rides a bicycle.
In addition, she loves to play with her two brothers and to sing.
Elizabeth will show you how to sign "sing to me" with the signs Edmund invented.
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not an ordinary sign language - he says Edmund has invented some of his own.
Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of reasons: genetic, such as Edmund's, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zika virus.
Symptoms and predictions can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it affects the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional load caused by the uncertain future.
I was just asking what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
And he still doesn't really know.
In fact, I haven't asked for a prognosis in a long time, because I don't expect anyone to be able to actually give me one.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defect caused by Zika.
It's getting easier.
You can believe it's going to get easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Heavy rain and flooding caused rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi
The heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana caused the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, and more rain was expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reported that several rivers in southeastern Louisiana and the southern Mississippi flooded their banks and posed a large flood threat due to extremely heavy rains.
Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities, and help is already coming to the needy counties.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor's security and emergency preparedness office, said they were getting requests from high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that Tangipahoa County alone asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood watch is valid until Saturday in a large part of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that another three to five centimetres of rain is expected in the area.
In southern Alabama, the flood watch was in effect on Friday, as the rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs are both located in Louisiana and were predicted to set a flood record during the weekend.
Weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood several houses in suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the threat is the flooding of Ascension County, down the river, as the flooding rivers slowly descend into Lake Maurepas.
To the south of the state border of Mississippi, the Tickfaw River in Liverpool, Louisiana, was at the highest level ever on Friday morning at 9 a.m.
The rescuers are still picking people out of flood water in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and stepson were close to Glolor on Friday among the rescued.
Sixty-two-year-old Hansford says the water from Beaver Creek, normally more than 400 feet from his house, rose quickly during the night.
He says he was warned by another stepson who lives nearby.
"We woke up, and the water kept rising," Hansford said.
It reached to my waist.
Hansford's wife told her husband that she has not seen the water in the stream so high in the 48 years she has lived there.
Hansford said that he and his family all have injuries, and that he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said the rescue workers rescued the trio in a large military-style lorry and took them to Gloster's fire station, where the rescued stayed on Friday.
Krautmann says the floods "will spread quickly" as heavy rains continue, and authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says an eyewitness near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said the country was completely saturated by the heavy rain that has been going on since Wednesday.
Heavy rain and street flooding led to the rescue of Tangipahoa County residents from their homes and the cancellation of lessons in five school districts, the authorities said.
CBS's subsidiary WWL reported that a city council member in Tangipaho said 200 homes were flooded.
The residents had been evacuated to two churches, but both are now flooded.
The county president, Robby Miller, said the authorities rescued 72 people and 7 pets who had been surrounded by high tides.
shelters have been opened in the cities of Amite and Hammond for those who have been evacuated.
"They can return to their homes when the water starts to go down," he said.
In the city of Hammond in Tangipahoa County, some 20 streets were closed because of rising water, and residents were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
"The last great flood here was in March," said Lacy Landrum, the city's administrator.
This is becoming a similar case.
In Mississippi, Harrison County emergency director Rupert Lacy said that steady rain continued along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said a handful of houses were reported to have flooded on Thursday, but so far there have been no reports of flooding on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and the rain continues."
A six-year-old Mahaj Brown "full of bullets" survives the shooting in Philadelphia
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, meaning another six-year-old shot in the city this week.
The child's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name was Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds to, among others, the groin, leg, arm and stomach, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"She suffered a lot, her little body was full of bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez said to the station.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the boy's condition has been recorded as critical and has undergone several operations.
The family tells the station he is expected to recover.
The boy was starting the first grade at the local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown block.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-olds.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were stable according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car with a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reported.
Two other victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be the shooter.
Researchers tell CBS Philadelphia that it appears there was crossfire between several shooters.
The shell casings of the type of attack weapon, which come from various types of attack weapons, filled the scene.
It seems that it was definitely a constant battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
"So it looks like there were several armed fighters here and they were in active combat," Philadelphia police chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
There have been no arrests, and according to the information received, the police are investigating surveillance tapes.
Another six-year-old, a girl, was hit by a stray bullet in her hand on Tuesday while playing in front of her home in West Oak Lane's neighborhood.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's how I call this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been to every summer Olympics since 1984, and the USA has never been so dominant.
And second: This team includes three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of this team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
This team looks, finally, like America.
It has also established the presence of black and Latin American women at the top of the sport.
The most successful female gymnast in the last four years has been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were the first and second.
This is great.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised me as an Olympic winner, and America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who perform unexpected but masterful gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman who has successively won individual gold in a women's multi-match.
And teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the top of the sport, but the situation does not look like this in gymnasiums across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie were all on the same path as Aly and Madison when they reached the Olympic team.
They are "Final Five" (last five), because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karolyi's last year as coach.
The reality, however, is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts usually practice in private gymnast clubs, maintained by parents who pay for training, facilities, travels, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts and families), and the list continues.
Most of these gymnast clubs are located in prosperous suburban neighbourhoods that can support the species.
In these clubs gymnasts get all their training, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to gymnast families.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez coach, have both coached their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to bring cheaper and available gymnastics training to communities where there are numerous young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organisations, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem to more than 15,000 urban youth (mainly black and Latin) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this remarkable Olympic sport.
Gymnasts develop body strength, flexibility and coordination, as well as mental diligence, discipline and determination.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for good health, school and work success.
This team inspiration makes thousands of young girls start gymnastics, and that's great.
Participation in sport is so important, especially for girls.
We live in an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing serious "girl power" by winning Olympic team gold, and for motivate so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road to healthy, strong and successful young femaleness.
Medical interns organizing new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute about the changes by agreeing to an improved contract with British Medical Association staff, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the contract, saying NHS was on "unknown ground", and even the small extra delays are damaging staff and patients.
The first doctors interns will be transferred to a new contract that includes changes in nighttime and weekend working methods to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Medical Trainee Committee, said in a statement last night: "Doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially that it accelerates the existing labour crisis, and that it does not treat all doctors equally."
When the first group of doctors is transferred to the new contract for only eight weeks, progress must be made and time is running out.
BMA's attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have met with the government side's unwillingness to participate and sometimes deep silence.
Despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt should act now, remove the sanctions and take into account the concerns of doctors' interns.
If he does not, the doctors' interns are ready to continue the industrial action.
The latest strike at the end of April meant a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine surgery and 100,000 appointments, when nurses and consultants were recruited to replace doctors on strike watch.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over changes by agreeing to an improved contract with British Medical Association staff.
BMA wants better weekend pay for those under contract with 54,000 doctors.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, appealed to doctors' interns not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: "In industrial battles, very little or nothing is achieved, but they put pressure on teams and services already in a demanding situation, and cause worry, anxiety and disturbance to patients, carers and their families."
In the last two months, we have talked with Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervision (Guardian Role) and whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that the ongoing positive discussion on other important topics - such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from sabbatical leave, costs of training, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay gap in medicine - is a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health are about respecting the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
A £2 a day medicine can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from a £2 a day drug after officials recommended that it be given to people for longer.
The anti-coagulant, ticagrelor, reduces the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
The medicine is already given for 12 months after a heart attack to lower the risk of a stroke or another attack.
NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people have a heart attack every year in England, and a quarter of them have a second attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty substances in the artery wall that form a stenose.
If the stenosis ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that blocks the blood flow to the heart causing a heart attack.
If the clot is released, it can travel with the blood and break the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one attack are at an increased risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, made by the Iso-Britan company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clotting less likely.
Today's draft NICE guidance recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg twice daily with aspirin for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "Without regard to the availability of effective treatments to prevent progression, as many as a quarter of those who have had a heart attack will later have another heart attack or stroke, often with devastating consequences."
Fear of regeneration can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Evidence shows that ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
When we first recommend ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to increase the available treatment options for several thousand people who might benefit from them.
Because ticagrelor's efficacy and safety data - especially regarding the risk of bleeding - are limited over periods of more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend treatment longer than during this period.
A culture of political correctness allows electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim regions
Tower Hamlets' former mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year because of corruption, giving impetus to the government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities being ignored, is revealed today in a shocking government report.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles boasts police, electoral officers and city councils for ignoring evidence of electoral fraud because of "racial and religious hypersensitivity."
The former Community secretary, the current anti-corruption emperor, said that the intimidation of voters on religious grounds is so serious that police should be allowed to set guard chains outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He recommends voters should present identity cards when voting to prove who they are.
Today, voters only have to say their name and address.
The report even suggests that the voter's finger should be inedible ink so that no one can vote twice.
The whistleblowers should be better protected, Sir Eric says.
He calls for wider access to council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working parties.
"This would not only protect against electoral fraud, but would protect local government from a culture of corruption and economic fraud that goes hand in hand with electoral fraud," he said.
The government commissioned a report as a result of the vote scandal in Tower Hamlets, East London.
Last year, the Special Election Court decided that the current mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office as a result of numerous charges of corruption and illegal actions.
The court found Rahman "enoughly perverted" his Muslim community's religious feelings and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamic fear.
Rahman is said to have "led his election campaign on the grounds that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were dubious, or the result of a person's voting as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed his particular concern about voting for electoral fraud by post, where high-ranking members of the Muslim community were said to have pressured people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made a number of recommendations for the cleaning of the voting system, including identity proof with ID
He said in his report: "The evidence was presented that vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"There were concerns that... state institutions had ignored such behaviour because of "politically correct" racial and religious hypersensitivity."
Sir Eric presented 50 proposals to clean up the system, including a ban on political activists being allowed to deal with postal ballots in order to stop the 'voice collection'.
The report, which Theresa May is considering, also calls for more stringent checks on registrations in order to prevent the electoral register from being used for immigration and compensation fraud.
Consider options for proving voters' identity before voting.
Use incorruptible ink on a voter's finger, so no one can vote twice.
Perform systematic nationality checks to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prevent political activists from handling ready-made voices and envelopes that send them through the post office.
Let the police set up guard chains around the polling stations.
Change the law to make it easier to accuse people of intimidation on the basis of the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photography illegal at polling stations.
Require that only English is used at polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen the training to ensure that the staff adheres to the rule that voters should go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric is cutting off the Grand London police force saying it's "surprising" that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlets incident.
"The election court stayed as a result of Lutfur Rahman and his officials' numerous corruption and illegal actions," he said.
He was found guilty without doubt on the basis of a number of grounds, according to the criminal evidence threshold.
He also criticized inefficient "tick-to-screen checks" in the city council's voting registration offices.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's Tower Hamlets sentence was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a glorious legacy as a parliamentary birth, but this worrying and secretive spread of electoral fraud and the denial of the facts of certain groups threatens this good reputation."
Crazy for Kate's bicyclist twin and other celebrity photos at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans at the 2016 Rio Olympics have gone crazy from French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be the impressive doppelganger of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer, who can boast of his own famous doppelganger - at least according to social media.
So in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces currently on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes that clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and wolf: United States men's archery team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's doppelganger found on the bicycle track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin star of Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's archery team, has caused a storm on Twitter after his pictures surfaced, looking scary like The Wolf of Wall Street star.
And in fact, as he became aware of the social media passion, the archer admitted that he has heard that he has looked like Leo since he was a kid.
"I don't see much resemblance myself, except maybe with the beard," Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London from 2012 will certainly also come up this year: the startling resemblance between Britain's long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina, with her big, expressive eyes, has been said to be the double of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has for years been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison.
Bigger gear in the eye: This user thinks Nathan is the "sporty version" of the Inception actor
Another long-term comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, both of whom have similar strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more than tan skin and blonde hair than Annalynne McCord, while U.S. team Nathan Adrian, according to fans, resembles "Joseph Gordon Levitt's athletic version."
Hard women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter, right, share a similar face shape and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Presentation of the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason between two similarities
A Twitter user recently expressed his happiness on the website that "others on the Internet also think Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And the American football star and Dexter's actress do indeed have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as Gabby Douglas, the gold medal-winning gymnast, whose own, beautiful, wide smile matches the smile of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes after saying Chinese swimmer "dead like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth message from the women's 4x200 metres freestyle was infuriated by CBC's live Olympic broadcast.
The Canadian television company CBC has had to apologize after one of its commentators said during the race a 14-year-old Chinese female swimmer "lost like a bad smell" and "dead like a pig."
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was turned off when he began to share some of his own opinions in the women's 4x200 metres freestyle finals.
MacDonald, who came to CBC's reporting team to bring "color", was heard saying: "That little 14-year-old from China screwed up, baby.
Too eager, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam between 1:57.79 and 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canada to catch China.
The viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC commentator just say China's 14-year-old swimmer 'died like a pig'????
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air."
China's Ai Yanhan was described in the women's freestyle 4 x 200 metres final message: "That little 14-year-old from China screwed up, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter was heavy and fast, with many challenging him.
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how reckless Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like racist people.
Soon after that, Scott Russell, who was running CBC broadcast, apologized live for MacDonald's comment, saying: "We regret that the comment about the swim performance was on the air.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we are sorry that this happened."
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to a comment.
Reporter contacta Scott Russel had to apologize for MacDonald.
CBC then copied and attached an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments.
The TV company also quickly apologized and published a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and that they were sent live.
Last night, we quickly took action and apologized to our viewers and followers on live television on social media.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not to him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized live and tried to define his remark by saying he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's message," he said in the CBC Olympic broadcast.
"I referred to the swimmer's performance, not him as a person."
Needless to say, I didn't mean it as disrespectful, and I'm really sorry.
Primark's client outraged by a woman who brazenly tried on underwear in the middle of the shop
The customers didn't know where to look when a woman undressed in the middle of Primark's shop to try underpants.
The fact that after assessing what she looked like in her pants, the woman stripped them off and put them back on the shelf did not make things any better.
He continued to circle and finally tried on four pairs of underpants in a shop located in the shopping centre of Bouverie Place in Folkestone.
Primark's shop at Bouverie Place's shopping centre in Folkestone, where she tried on underwear and then put them back on the shelf
At the same time, Jenny Davidson, a mother of two in the store, said that after trying on underwear, the mysterious woman "redressed and walked away from the store without buying anything."
He said, "People didn't believe their eyes."
The woman stood in the middle of the store floor, took a pair of undies, took off her own tights and underwear, and put them on.
"He didn't even try to find a remote place to make amends, he just stood there shameless."
"Everybody stared, while he took off his underpants again and obviously didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf."
He did the same for three more couples before finally deciding he didn't like anything he saw, dressed again and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care who was watching - or thinking about the person who would end up buying the underwear he was trying on."
Davidson, a 33-year-old living in Kent city, said: "It's disgusting to think someone is taking home underwear someone else has tried but hasn't been cleaned."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I realised that the staff apparently tried to remove the items of clothing after the woman left, which is fine."
"It would be terrible to go home with new underpants and find that another woman has put them on and stripped them off, and they haven't been washed."
Primark's spokesman said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place at Folkestone's store on Tuesday, August 9.
All the products in question have been removed from the sale.'
This allows you to defend yourself against armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Krav Maga Federation's Grand Master Rhon Mizrach, who lives in New York, to find out how to deal with gun-wielding robbers at close range.
Whether you are approached from front or back, this video shows how you can pay the attacker in the same way.
According to Mizrachi, if you are approached from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and "reel the line of fire."
Then you grab the gun between the forearm and the shoulder before hitting the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Keep hitting the groin with the knee, and when the attacker goes from pain to pain, twist the gun from his hands, hit him at the back of the gun in the face, and stand back to keep the gun pointed at him.
If an armed person approaches from the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the gun, and turn it around so that the criminal cannot launch.
At the same time put weight on the gun and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip, back off and point a gun at him.
Does that sound difficult?
Check the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does this.
But remember, if you're not Krav Maga's grandmaster, the safest way out of a robbery situation is to give up your money.
Tourist Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe for a travel guide
The British traveler has posed a serious challenge to his immune system and vomit reflexes by licking some of Europe's dirtiest and disgusting places.
A host from Suffolk and traveler Ian Wright, 51, licked euro notes, a railing in Piccadilly Circus, a train toilet flush button, and a Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each target, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was about to get into.
However, the experiment, which was made in a film called "Inner Power" produced surprising results.
The idea of licking a train flush button used by thousands of people may seem completely repugnant, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On his way across Europe, Wright kept talking to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left him with anything else in his mouth of bad taste.
Wright became known as a tester of the durability of his gut as he traveled around the world and ate strange and wonderful things.
This mission, extending from railings from public railway stations to a toilet seat flush button, really tested his immune system.
In the film he said: "Since I was a child, I've been rather carefree about my health, and I've put all kinds of things in my mouth, starting with dirt, worms and muddy water."
He certainly confirmed his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was the filthy Russian public toilet.
His sample contained a photometer reading of over 4,000 units.
For comparison, the number of newly washed hands should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public toilet he refused to lick when the photometer showed more than 4,000 units, and the newly washed hands score less than 60.
Wright has produced a traveler's film, "Inner Power", together with a Finnish dairy, Valio, showing the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the film, the wedding said: "This is almost the worst thing I've smelled in the toilet."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting in here.
On the trail of internal strength, Finnish dairy, Valio, was produced together.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as C and D vitamins that help boost people's gut bacteria and immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, head of Valio's snacks, juice and new categories, said: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at and at the same time explain the probiotic interests.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air, and we came to the idea of 'let's call Ian'.'
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a bigger context: to tell about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and its connection to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary we can tell consumers more about it in an interesting way.
I think the documentary also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Document director Tom Hakala added: "Let's just say it like this: if Ian had licked some of the things I asked him for, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film, I would have lost my respect for him."
Understandably, some of the things licked were easier for Ian, while others were quite difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty licks saved."
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 per cent of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria specifically to the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 per cent said they at least occasionally use products to which lactic acid bacteria have been added.
A bully family destroyed a rental house in Cornwall, Saltash, before eviction
The bully family caused £50,000 damage to their rental house after they were evicted for terrorizing their neighbours.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of Cornwall's Saltash property after several complaints about them.
After they had been forcefully removed from the property, upset housing workers found the property to be in poor condition.
The walls had been filled with gaping holes, floorboards had been torn, garbage had been spread to the floor and the walls had been smudged with graffiti.
The family has now moved elsewhere and is believed to be living in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, head of Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid the property could not be repaired.
He said: "This has been a real nightmare for the residents, and I don't think people should have to live like this.
There are a lot of things to consider, because this property is likely to be known through Cornwall's less comfortable groups.
This family is notorious, and their name is notorious."
The couple had three sons who lived in the property occasionally, and police said the family's terror contained street fighting with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive shouting, fighting and swearing.
In June, 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was on the lease, was decided on antisocial behaviour.
In many of the rooms of the house under the threat of demolition, old waste was found.
The floorboards had been pulled up from a property from which drugs had previously been transmitted.
Neighbors said the family was seen fighting on the street, and the police were regularly called.
Cornwall Housing forcefully evicted a woman and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors thanked the eviction, saying that their lives had become a living hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived as their neighbors for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We've seen the police here an incredible number of times.
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet - we're not used to it!
It's wonderful, now that they're finally gone."
Adam Fitzpatrick, executive director of Cornwall Housing's neighborhood, said the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and police were often invited to the property
Garbage and old toys have been thrown down to the crazed wall of the rental house.
He added: "It's a shame the resident didn't take any responsibility for his own and his family's behaviour, because eviction is always the last procedure Cornwall Housing considered.
This was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was extreme, and their actions must have horrified the neighbours.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, Devon and Cornwall police and brave members of the community who have given us information.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to the neighbours and send a message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys all lived in the property at different times, but they were all in their 20s.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one bedroom after the eviction
The housing company's employees must now clean up the waste surfaces around the house
In 2014, the police raided the property and found over 70 g of cannabis, plus scales, supplies and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for pleading guilty to possession of a class B drug as an intention to pass it on.
He claimed the money was meant for his son Lee Skeldon's tombstone, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently Tanya and her partner live homeless now that they have been frozen in private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house's rooms had been crammed with graffiti.
Police say they try to evict residents who flout the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police said the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.
"This is a message to those who think their behaviour is without consequences, as well as to those who suffer from such behaviour," he said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behaviour, and the police will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were terrified when a military jet flew low on the beach
Sun - worshiping tourists in Aveiro, Portugal, were shocked by their lives
The Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion plane swung past really low
Air Force said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised
Right now, terrified tourists began to panic as a low-flying jet swept over a full beach.
The dramatic recording shows how a military plane came close to contact with sun worshipers on the sand strip in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers stood up as they began to understandably worry about the noise from the jet, even though they did not at first see what was coming from behind the clouds toward them.
The incident took place in Costa Nova, near Aveiro, yesterday afternoon.
One of the many holidaymakers who posted videos of a dramatic pass in social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said: "It went by twice really low, and in one place it looked like it was about to crash."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and I really felt like a plane was falling on top of me."
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared from the darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese air force said today that the P-3C Orion pilot was on a training flight to identify fishing boats near the coast, and the plane had to land so low because it was the only way to check the boats.
He said the jet had flown much lower than usual because of the poor visibility caused by the smoke from nearby fires, but the air force assured that no one was in danger.
Land fires have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal this summer, and four people have died on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low because of the conditions that affected the visibility, the smoke caused by the fires and the thick fog
The plane was on a training flight, and as part of the training, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats
Exote's first half result better than expected
South Karelia Social and Health Care District (Exote) made 3.4 million euros better than planned in January - June.
Eksote's result was 4.3 million euros in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all operations.
This year Eksote aims to shorten the queues of measures.
Exote covers a deficit previously created with a surplus.
The excess of it may be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The result for the whole year is expected to be 4.6 million euros better than planned.
Eksote's board will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special border soldiers swore a military oath in Immola
The 70 conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School swore a military oath on Friday.
The military oath ceremony of the Rangers of the Border and Coast Guard School was held in Immola on Friday.
The oath event of the 10th Special Border Jääkäri course was organised on the military field.
The military oath was taken by 70 conscripts.
Special border soldiers are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied to be a special border soldier.
250 of them were invited to the selection tests.
Special border soldiers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans from the wartime border forces attended a veteran meeting in connection with the jury.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who participated in the event were born in 1918.
A circle ahead of a bandit - criminal intelligence helps solve crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
From the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 police departments in Finland has operated a RTA unit, i.e. criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The unit's operation is invisible outwards.
In Häme Police Department, the unit consists of a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's run by a Sergeant stationed in Lahti.
Chief of Staff is Chief of Staff in Lahde.
In addition, the unit's strength includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone's working in a civilian uniform.
The unit has proved its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces different explanations for the rest of the police.
In Häme, for example, it has acquired information about asylum seekers.
Latest reform of working methods
The establishment of analysis units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The goal has been to prevent crime, that is, to keep the police from turning up more and more often when they get an alarm.
With the information collected and analysed by the unit, the daily police activity is targeted where it is most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence centre, less than three national units were established in the country, and their own criminal intelligence unit for each police department.
In Vantaa, the PTR Centre, which is operating in connection with the Central Crime Police, is the national leader.
PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and Border Guard as their name suggests.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas divided by police departments, and their task is to provide information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond your own territory
While the individual police are aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is going on throughout the police department's area.
Intelligence also extends beyond the limits of your own department, because so does crime.
Those working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the primary police.
Through registers, an alert task database and observations, the unit aims to draw police attention to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes.
This is called a series, and it is one of the most important tools in criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible in the work, whether honest or criminal.
Based on the method used, the unsub is a certain image.
The compilation can be done either on the basis of the method of making or on the basis of the person, depending on which police have more information about.
Criminals Learn From Their Mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit don't walk around the city with their collars up, but their work is not entirely public either.
There is no information about the methods used by both criminals and their own, because it could lead to professional criminals developing their operations to try and prevent police attempts to combat crime.
The police will state these methods publicly if they anticipate a threat.
For example, this case was reported in early summer, the method of marking empty apartments used in house break-ins.
In it, the people put a stick, a pin or a piece of tape on the front door of the apartment to test whether the residents were really travelling.
The pre-trial material must be made public at least for the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they make.
The cleverer order the District Court minutes, which may, for example, show that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
Next time, we're going to steal with gloves on.
The case has been interviewed by Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppänen from the Häme Police Department, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police Department, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärvi from the Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Crime Police Department.
The police collect and analyse information that is used to plan practical operations.
In the background, the reduction in labour and funding volumes.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken already 30 years ago.
The latest change was a three-stage PORA reform that ended at the end of the year 2013.
The national cooperation collects information from outside the boundaries of Finland and its own department.
A schoolgirl who joined the ISIS from London killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join Isis, has been rumored to have died in Syria.
Tasname Akunjee, a lawyer, said the girl's family heard that she died in Syria's Raqqa a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that the girl was believed to have died in a Russian air strike against Raqqa, an organization's base in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just as she was planning an escape from the war-torn country and her return to Britain.
"You can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can serve as a tombstone and a will for others, that there are real risks of going to the war zone - that it could cause people to give up making such a decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London schoolgirls flew to Turkey, from where they took a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family were told that she had married an Isis fighter in Syria and that she became a widow after just a few months.
Reid says Clinton will see Garland as a Supreme Court candidate if he is elected
Senate Democratic Director Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected president.
The Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose to replace the late Supreme Court member Antoni Scalia.
Reid said in a teleconference on Thursday that he predicts "some degree of certainty" Clinton will choose Garland.
Reid's representative later said he hadn't talked to Clinton directly about whether he would appoint Garland and that it was speculation.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't want to "draw the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeal District of Columbia.
Reid said Republicans blocking Garland's nomination were Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's "handlers" and "enablers."
He said Trump wasn't fit for office.
Treats says the nude calendar is "for women as well as for men"
Treats magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they're going to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with lots of nude photos differs from the old school Playboy because "Playboy is for men."
I do this for women.
Apparently he thinks the calendar is for them too.
"We have to start showing timeless and classic nudity where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these pictures of the naked female body," Shaw said in a press release that announced the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's beautiful art.
Models can leave images online or in personally open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl destination: who actually buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyl.
Before you rush to fill the comment section with irritated insults written by the nickname NotAll LonelyMiddleMen, you will notice that this claim is based on actual information.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed re-entry of records is not because more and more people born in this millennium are excited about the novelty of physical objects, but about the appetite of middle ages.
Apparently those who have recently purchased vinyl records are most likely to be 45-54 years old.
In fact, those of 18-24-year-olds who are less likely to buy records are.
Also, it is not just a matter of collecting enthusiasts, but of emotional significance: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings in their hearts (56% vs 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs 66%).
But is YouGov's results true?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit. I'd be signaling a lot before I stopped, making a cup out of my hands and saying something authoritative, like, "Let's take a closer look at it."
Let's take a closer look.
At a time when Soho's charm and dirt are slowly removed - hotels, chain restaurants and shops, and office supplies now fill up buildings with previously independent stores - a handful of great specialized record stores still remain.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop filming for a moment, as I stand very close to different men in some of these shops trying to judge by observing their age and emotional temperament.
Stuart, 55 from Glasgow, followed by Sister Ray (the counter: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (the counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in 20), spends his afternoon in London for a meeting, and goes around the shops to spend a few hours.
I'll see if he's a collector.
"I guess I am," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records that appear above the picture (he emailed the sample, I didn't follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for such a huge number of records and singles is partly the result of his disposable income: now he can buy records he couldn't afford when they were originally released, and he can re-buy those he sold when he was young and broke.
"A large part of the material I bought is from the late 60s and early 70s, records that were released when there were 11 or 12, records that I was probably a little too young to acquire," he said.
He agrees that record buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, adding: "I don't smoke or drink much.
This is my vice."
25-year-old Wez, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he meets fit the profile of YouGov.
But he has noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by media enthusiasm, people who have heard that the records have come back into fashion and who have come to need to buy their old records back.
Based on the discussions I've had, people have usually gotten rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their record back," he said.
This may explain the increase in the number of vinyl wake-ups of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of the records?
In a shop like Phonica it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores offer a comforting community for like-minded people.
According to Wez, some older customers have been particularly injured by the local payment system.
Some vinyl fans can be overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to rely on the permanence of familiar disk decks, objects that trigger teenage memories of happy days.
"I think that sometimes it can be about filling a gap or some kind of comfort that the possession of objects creates," Wez says.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It's an easy way to fill your mind.
"We're like their social workers!" the other employee suddenly said from the record stack.
A April poll conducted by the ICM revealed that nearly 50% of people who had bought a vinyl album last month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player they will never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyl have no record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look seriously concerned as I browsed through a stack of bona nova collections.
This "prize" aspect of the revival is something that Jonny, 42, who also works at the Sounds of the Universe (the counter: three middle-aged men).
"Someone came in a while ago and said, 'I don't have a record player, but I want to buy Radiohead's record so we can put it on the shelf," he said.
This is not a big part, but it is definitely happening.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
So not older people, but younger people, late teens, who are just getting excited about it.
Fop, which now has almost a whole floor reserved for vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the movements mentioned earlier - the most recent synth and sex-filled pop in Wild Beast, and not improvisation jazz - is great to see a variety of customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but it's hard to prove the gnawing psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes, watching different records on sale.
He's doing window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn't make a lot of money, so record collecting is not really an option.
"It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music either on a computer or some other way, but the beauty of vinyl is..." he sighs in love.
"I don't know how to explain - it's really unique."
My last stop is said to have raised a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I'm trying to look like I'm looking at jeans shorts, I'm observing a group of teenage girls who gather around Polaroid cameras for a while before father and daughter think about buying Crosley's record player.
On the left is a staircase with a wall covered with records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records of any average collection.
No one is looking at them - perhaps because they are just decorations, and some are so high that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's purely "art vinyl."
But given that even the little attention these objects receive can mean more money for industry and send a few customers to Soho's for more, there's not much to complain about.
It comes as no surprise that the part of the population that is more likely to have more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury items, such as vinyl.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov's results are accurate at least in Soho record stores, they do not rule out the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or office.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday mornings loitering around the record shops on Berwick Street looking at records and avoiding the creepy 30-year-old artificial TV host looking over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holker is the longest living vertebrate animal - video report
Researchers say Holker has a longer life span than any other vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who has studied sharks, says the record is for a female whose age is believed to be between 272 and 512 years, which is five metres long.
The French court rejects the application to terminate the sale of Jungle refugee camp
The French court has rejected Calais authorities' application to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants from Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
In a court hearing this week, Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to dismantle a total of 72 temporary shops, where people inside the camp sell things from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea for 50 cents (40 cents), or sell simple food for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Calais Prefect's office argued that the places should be dismantled because they represent a tax-free co-economic and because they are a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that free meals offered by state-supported organisations and other groups do not provide enough food for the increasing numbers of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often offer shelter and free meals to those who need them.
The court in Lille ruled that there were no legal grounds for evicting 72 people running a temporary trade, but said that Calais' prefect's concern "was perfectly understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people who are "extremely insecure."
He said the facilities provided peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under the threat of demolition was the Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, which operates without profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum advice to hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition to protect the children's cafe.
A letter to the Guardian said that closing the cafe "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old."
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in Jungle's camp has risen to 9,000 - top reading - since the number of arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
Food prices fall clearly faster in Finland than the EU average
Food in Finland will fall sharply to the satisfaction of consumers and to the shame of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by nearly five per cent in three years, while the average price in EU countries fell by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, in Germany and Sweden, food has become one per cent more expensive.
In the last three years, the price of food has fallen most in Finland among the EU countries with the same wage level as in Finland.
From analogue countries only in Britain, food prices have fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are based on an article by Statistics Finland's development manager Ilkka Lehtinen, published in the Tieto & Trends blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices that are related to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data are from June this year.
At the beginning of the 2010s, the price of food rose sharply.
In 2013, prices rose close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then a turn of events followed, after which food has become cheaper year by year.
Now the price is weighed by Russian bans on food imports, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
That is why the supply of dairy and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term," Lehtinen says.
Increased price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in the price.
The large chains of stores S Group and Kesko have both decreased their prices.
For the consumer, price competition has been shown as spectacular advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not a place for cheap food, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland from EU countries with wage levels similar to those in Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by value added tax.
He found that if the control countries had the same rate of value added tax, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with similar pay levels.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the control countries, only Germans and Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to get to the old EU countries' level of food prices, VAT should be halved to the EU average and continue the price competition," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that the calculations he has made at VAT rates are indicative.
School's not quite what it used to be.
Anyone returning to school may find that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been prepared for schools, which will be implemented in all primary schools at the beginning of the semester.
It is a rule that all schools in Finland operate.
The schools decide the details themselves, but the plan tells the official goals.
The new guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ in many ways from the old ones.
For example, the learning of the arts is abandoned, and instead, the schools begin to practice coding.
Swedish education starts in the sixth grade at the latest, and social studies begin already on four.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of students.
It used to be thought that the teacher was teaching the students, but now everyone needs to be active and learn from each other.
This is how you try to make school more interesting.
The world's longest-lived vertebrate was found - an ice shark can live up to 400 years
The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus), even known as ice sharks, does not reach maturity until 150 years old.
It can live another 250 years after that, reports a new study.
The numbers make the sport the longest-lived vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it is passed only by an Icelandic clam whose oldest known specimen has been dated to 507.
Greenland sharks swim along the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are one of the biggest fish in the Arctic.
The females stretch longer than the males, they can grow to more than five metres.
Because the rate of growth is slow, according to the follow-up, only about a centimetre a year, adult individuals have been forced to live for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues from the University of Copenhagen found out.
He defined the adult ice sharks from the age of 28 females that had been caught by fishermen.
The age of fish was revealed by radiocarbon dating of eye lenses.
The average age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The two biggest fish in the sample, 593 and 502 centimetres, were found to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have found that the female ice sharkes only reach maturity by more than four metres, the researchers calculated that they are about 150 years old at that stage.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann fired for nearly 300 - sellers will not be deducted
Nearly 300 employees are made redundant from Stockmann department store company.
Co-operation companies in a company that got into difficulties ended in the beginning of August.
"As a result of the negotiations, about 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will be made redundant," Stockmann said in his statement.
According to the report, the number of department stores sellers will not be reduced so that the customer service will not suffer.
In addition, about 80 support workers are offered new jobs as a seller.
Stockmann's negotiations involved about 3,000 employees.
When they began, the need for deduction was estimated to be about 380 employees.
The reduction of the population is aimed at annual cost savings of about €20 million, which are expected to come true next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme to save €50 million this year.
The background is Stockmann's difficulties in making the department store profitable.
Even though the Group's adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the department store trade still makes losses.
According to Stockmann's acting CEO Lauri Veijalainen, sales in department stores have not reached the company's goals.
"Unfortunately, staff cuts are necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail's positive operating result in 2018," Veijalainen said in a statement.
The second quarter result improvement was based especially on the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best second-quarter turnover and result ever.
Lindex' operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
Last year, the Group's operating result for the whole Stockmann Group was 4.1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperature below 20 degrees in the whole country
The low-pressure centre on the northern part of Finland will keep the weather rainy on Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
There will also be rain showers in the central parts of the country, but southward is pouty.
The temperature is not very summery any more, as mercury remains below 20 degrees in the whole country.
In the rainy areas of the north, 10-15 degrees.
Kenya's athletics team is shaken by the doping scandal - an odd explanation for the coach's move
Kenyan athletic coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it turned out that Anzrah was a national athlete in a doping test.
The news agency AP said the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is the 800-metre star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of Kenya's national team, said that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had given a sample as Rotich in the surprise test.
Doping officials went to report Anzrah to the authorities.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because he "did his crime against the Kenyan national team."
He performed as an athlete, gave a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour," Kip Tei, chairman of the Kenya Olympic Committee, thundered at Reuters news agency.
The Olympic athletics will begin on Friday, and Rotich is due to run right then and then.
It is not yet known whether the runner will be aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth in the World Championship last year and has already won Rio's favourites.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan athletics team claimed that Anzrah only went on an athlete's accreditation card to get free meals in the race village.
When anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid he would be exposed," the source said.
Where is everyone?
Rio athletics stadium rubbers its void
Where is everyone?
At least not in Rio Olympic Stadium watching athletics.
On Friday, a battle began in Rio about athletics medals, but the world's top individuals were allowed to present their skills to a confusingly empty stands.
The Rio organisers said on Friday that only 58 per cent of the first-day morning tickets and 65 per cent of the evening tickets have been sold.
The other one was in London four years ago, where the stadium was bulging about cheering people.
The tickets to the finals have already been sold out in Rio.
The loss of audience at the Rio Olympics has attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, there have been thousands of empty seats in the stands of rugby, canoeing and riding.
When Brazil's medal hopes for Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the stands were full.
After the Brazilian duo, Holland played against Russia, and about 30 per cent of the 12,000 stands were full.
The bad deal is explained at least by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with economic difficulties, is far away for European and Asian racing tourists, and many of the Olympic sports are strange for Brazilians used to football.
True, even the first match of the Brazilian football team did not fill the football stadium.
At the weekend, event organisers' spokesman Mario Andrada said that 82 per cent of the tickets had been sold at that time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million endings left to sell," Andrada said according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets for the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, even though the tickets cost almost half more than in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from about nine euros to over a thousand euros at the opening.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty spaces, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed, because the organisers need money and try to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, however, organisers have given 240 000 tickets to schoolchildren in the country for less well-known sports, such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty seats at Rio Stadium in the morning.
Even a beach volleyball on Copacaba sand has not interested the audience.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London 2012.
There were plenty of people in the gallery.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation by new means.
The Foundation, founded last year, acquires ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, private, companies and communities can use money to claim holder rights on the land.
The Foundation has acquired its first land area in Lapland.
The land area is virtually divided into blocks that those who want to acquire the right to wear for a fee.
The holder will have a veto in his 187-square block, which in practice means that not every holder will be required to be approved if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
You can also acquire holder rights for several blocks.
Acquiring a right of control is something concrete that you can leave as an inheritance or as a gift.
You don't have to carry banners or chain yourself somewhere to protect the environment," Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired the right of control for his company, explains.
Those who have acquired the right of control will receive precise location information from their block, allowing for example a visit to the block.
The names of those who have acquired the rights of the holder appear on the Foundation's website on the same map where the land block information can be found.
Leviäkangas sees its nature conservation acquisition as a risk only that the Foundation's operations change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been founded as a non-profit foundation to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the Foundation would act unethically or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea behind the Helsinki Foundation's Haltija project is to protect nature areas in such a way that they can be intact and at peace.
The Foundation acquires land either by buying or by making a donation.
It finances its operations mainly through the sale of holders' rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims outside Finland's borders and plans to buy land in Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its operations in a pop-up forest at Helsinki Market Square on August 13-19.
The bike thieves torment Turkey the worst in the big cities - see the situation in your municipality
The bike thieves torment Turkey the worst in Finland's big cities.
This year more bikes have been stolen in proportion to the population than in nine other major cities.
According to the bike thefts reported to the police, Helsingin Sanomat found out how many bicycles and parts of them have been stolen in the ten largest cities in January to August of this year, calculated per 1,000 inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti took the lead.
According to police records, there were four to five bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
Instead, in Espoo and Kouvola, police were reported only about two bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
It's a big difference.
"There are double thefts in other cities relative to the population," police inspector Tommi Reen describes.
Turku police wonder why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
"The frequency of thefts can be affected by how much people ride bikes in the city and how many bikes there are at all," says Sergeant Teemu Äikäs.
Tommi Reen from the police department thinks it is quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will take the lead in comparison.
The number of bike thefts goes largely according to what are the study and cycling cities.
Turku has a tight centre, short distances and lots of bikes available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city, where city centres are distant from each other and bicycles are not necessarily the primary means of transport," Reen says.
In all of Finland, slightly fewer bike thefts have come to the police's attention in January-August than in the corresponding period last year.
But there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, police report just over 20,000 bike thefts every year.
It means 50-60 bikes every day and about 4,000 bikes a year in Helsinki alone.
"They're big amounts," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more bikes, because only some of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report bike theft, even if fewer than one in 10 reported cases are solved.
Typical solved bike theft is one where police are immediately informed of the theft and the thief is caught freshly.
"You can also find cases in other investigations, when, for example, stolen bikes can be found in a drug-related apartment," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught every week in connection with the act itself or in connection with a police investigation, says senior officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bikes are stolen from, for example, the bike racks, courtyards, warehouses and bike cellars at shopping centres, i.e. practically everywhere they are usually kept.
As in previous years, Jopas are the most stolen of individual bike models.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves take the bike for their short-term use, for example, but a large part of the stolen bikes end up on the market, for example, via the Internet.
They remain on the domestic market.
"At least it hasn't come to the police's attention that stolen bikes are going abroad much," Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
Some will probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about that.
The buyer of a used bike must be vigilant, as he may be guilty of a concealment offence or a breach.
"The alarm bells should be ringing if a bike in good condition is sold at a price that is clearly underpriced," Reen says.
Special library officer Severi Hirvi carries his colorful Nopsa to the shelters of the Kallio library in Helsinki for the duration of his working day.
He has had five bikes, but none have been stolen, says Hirvi. "It has never been taken, it has been a good monk."
"Maybe this isn't so attractive to thieves, it doesn't necessarily have hipster value," Hirvi from Helsinki ponders.
Siiri Valve, who was in a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, quickly locked her bike with a small U-lock.
Now the bike pecked against the wall of the kiosk, but usually Valve locks his bike on something solid, like a bike rack.
"It's going to be a lot of thought, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," says a student from Helsinki about his white bicycle, the frame of which alone cost about 500 euros.
"All the time you hear from your friends that bikes have been stolen."
"Most of the time bad spins, such slob Jokos."
A year ago, a bike was stolen from Valve himself from the courtyard of the housing company.
But the bike had not been locked, so Valve was expecting it to be taken.
Persons under 15 years of age to be held accountable for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer jury members familiar from the United States
In Helsinki, a so-called peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from getting caught in a criminal cycle.
Initially, the experiment will apply to those under the age of 15, who are now left without criminal liability.
The peer jury is addressing the first crime committed by a young person.
The idea is that the peer jury will discuss the incident with the offender and impose a sanction.
A week later, the offender can join the peer jury himself to make up for what he did.
There may be other consequences, for example a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Laitio, director of youth services, says the model is not tight.
We have other mediation models that are used side by side.
"All of the youth's actions are directed in a more responsible direction, so that everything would not be ruined by the first mistake," Laitio says.
The peer jury has been modeled on the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that a young person, after his first crime, will not be faced with an adult panel, but will reflect on what happened with people about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Iikka Lovio, a service designer at Palmu service design agency that followed the experiment, said it was an assault that was successfully solved.
The first crimes, especially those under the age of 15, have not necessarily been dealt with at all before.
"It's been a message to continue on the path you've chosen," Lovio says.
The peer jury is part of the Helsinki project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new practices are offered to all those who need it, not just to young immigrants.
More than 70 Republican leaders want the party to stop funding Trump's campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the American newspaper Politico, who had received a draft of it.
According to the newspaper, the open letter is addressed to the President of the National Republican Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money to be directed to congressional elections instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump and his indifference, incompetentness and record displeasure threaten to bring a landslide to the Democrats in these elections," said Politico.
Only direct targeting of all possible funds to the congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning with a Trump-crowned anchor around their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential election are decreasing day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent in the course of next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organisers of the letter is prominently anti-Trump Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress" and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists a number of Donald Trump's actions that are believed to have hurt millions of voters.
He is also said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for U.S. families with children
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton reported on the details of his economic policy on Thursday evening.
I'm running for president to make the U.S. economy go well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is running for president to make the economy work well for him and his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
Clinton's plan focuses on a massive $275 billion five-year programme to improve U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be partly financed by the tax increases of the rich, partly by private money.
The construction programme is a hand-to-hand hand for American workers who suffered as the factories moved to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme the biggest investment in well-paid jobs after World War II.
We are a builder's people, we must go back to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to make it easier for working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders anyway, pointing out that the rich should pay their fair share of the taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it will have to pay the departure tax, Clinton said.
Today he opposes the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he once supported.
"I, as the President, am opposed to any trade agreements that work against employees or wages," Clinton promised.
According to speculations published by The Washington Post before Clinton's speech, Clinton intended to criticise Republican Donald Trump's financial programme on Monday for "only favoring millionaires like this one."
Mr. Clinton has previously called a "Trump loophole" a discount on corporate taxes proposed by Mr. Trump.
On Thursday, Clinton emphasised that she herself was the daughter of a small entrepreneur.
He reminded listeners of small entrepreneurs, whose bills Trump has left unpaid, and of the clothes Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start by making his own products in America," Clinton said.
These are the ratings of Rio: the competitions have not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile app is interesting
Usually sports competitions are shown in TV viewer statistics as sharp peaks.
So far, the Rio Olympics have not reached a great number of viewers.
At a time, the competitions have glued 12 per cent of the population to the screens: at the same time, 615 000 viewers from Yle's Olympic channel TV2 followed the swim on Tuesday night.
For comparison: the European athletics competitions one month ago got close to 800,000 viewers at a time, and the European Football Championships got well over a million.
The most interesting of the Olympic sports have so far been Sunday night cycling and the gymnasium that opened the fifth day of the race, both of which reached almost half a million viewers on the Olympic channel at a time.
Yle sports chief Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the ratings and reminds that the viewers will be divided into several different instruments for the first time in the Rio Olympics.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympic Games from Rio Areena.
We are pleased with how many TV viewers choose the Olympics in the first place.
Even on the television side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sporting events Yle has dedicated an entire channel to.
When broadcast 24 hours a day, from 20,000 to 500 000 viewers all the time, it is a good basis.
The ratings are smaller than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - most of Rio's competition broadcasts come in Finland during the night.
Another reason for the weak interest - if someone thinks it's lame - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the early games, the interest would have bounced up with it.
In addition, athletics is just beginning, as are other species of interest to Finns: sailing and riding.
According to Pokkinen, the initial ratings have been close to what was expected.
When athletics begin, ratings explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the games, which in the first days of the Games rose to the Apple App Store as the most downloaded free app in Finland.
By Monday, the application had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'd say we're already going around 200,000 downloads.
"We won't get online ratings until later," Pokkinen says
Rio Areena hasn't worked as well as it would have been for all users.
Pokkinen says feedback has come and the faults have been corrected.
The use of Rio Areena has been accompanied by a delay and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
There are updated versions of the apps that should correct the errors.
The Rio Olympics are more visible on Yle's channels and in the arena than any other sporting event ever before.
Some sports can be watched on Yle Fem, and Yle Speech broadcasts the games on the radio every day.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborious for Yle ever, but also the last to be followed only by Yle channels.
From 2018, Olympic sports will be visible on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, which has a depth of 95,3 metres on Ristinselkä.
It may be even deeper.
Technology diving instructor Matti Kannela found about 20 square metres of pressure on Ristiselkä, the bottom of which was shown to be 104 metres by the diving computer.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried to strengthen the observation in vain by sonaring.
The method does not necessarily find a small depth in 100 metres, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So so far, the official depth is still 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes are Inarijärvi (92 metres) and Suvasvesi (90 metres).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi reach over 80 metres.
They have not been studied as closely as Päijänne.
Especially the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully charted.
"There could well be unknown depths," Kannel says.
If the deepest lake is defined by average depth, it is the Great Yukajärvi, 23 metres.
Viewed in this way, Päijänne does not make it to the top ten, and Suvasvesi is even further from the top.
Correction August 12th at 2.29 p.m.: The last paragraph corrected, where the deepest lakes in the middle depth were wrong.
Ihalainen from the tax discount: Pensioners' taxation still tighter
Pensioners' taxation is still tighter than employees.
Ihalainen says that the incident was raised under parliamentary elections and the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to the employees.
The Government's proposal does not contain this.
We think it should definitely be there.
The promises given should be followed after the election, he says to the media in the West.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received labour income reductions that reduced taxation.
The matter was heated up in parliament by opposition representatives who grilled Alexander Stubb, then Minister of Finance, for election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
According to Ihalainen, the policy presented by the Minister of Finance, Petteri Orpo, is mainly about securing purchasing power and not increasing it, because next year wages will not be raised.
He says the tax reduction will have a positive effect on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with Prime Minister Juha Sipilä's (Central) and Orpo's messages about the desire to respect the hard-won competitiveness pact.
He says sticking to the contract is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the reign.
It is done with the strength of the labour market organisations, so it should not be ruined by questioning.
It is necessary because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people's own faith in the future.
To tackle long-term unemployment in a row
Ihalainen appeals to the government to tackle long-term unemployment, at least to stop its growth, in the budget line.
In June, there were about 17,000 more long-term unemployed than a year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's goal of raising the employment rate to 72 per cent will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very big social fall.
Ambassador: There are no known Finnish victims in Thailand's attacks
At least four people died in the bombings that took place in Thailand last night and last night in Finland.
The embassy urges the Finns in the country to pay attention and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the authorities' instructions.
Finnish tourists planning to travel to Thailand should not cancel their journey because of the explosions, but the embassy's advice on caution should be followed, says Westphalen.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish travel season to Thailand dates back to the turn of the year.
The majority of Thailand tourists come from Southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The embassy has tried to reach out specifically to Finns in Hua Hin to get information about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be fine, says Westphalen.
No information about the unsub
According to Westphalen, the person responsible for the attacks is still unknown.
The ambassador thinks that the events may be related to the political unrest in Thailand's divided society and to last week's referendum on the constitution drawn up by the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people in the country were arrested who said they were against the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, the ethnic national conflict surrounding the Muslim population is smouldering, says Westphalen.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today is a big, local holiday in Bangkok, says Westphalen.
According to him, the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks should have an effect on the day's course, so that the authorities are very precise about security.
Thai police: The attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been ruled out, according to the Thai police news agency AP.
At least four people have died in Thailand in 24 hours after 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as the tourist-like Phuket and Hua Hin.
In a tourist attraction favoured by Finns, the holiday island Phuket had four bombs exploded in the night, says Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current information, they did not kill.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the newspaper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where, according to the newspaper, one person was wounded.
In the popular tourist destination Hua Hin, a total of four bombs have exploded yesterday and today, according to local authorities.
At least one died in both double bombings.
In addition, in southern Thailand, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Thani and in the town of Trang.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it is used to travel to the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The person responsible for the attacks is unknown
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the military junta in Thailand, the attacker is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not stir people up to panic any more, he said to the reporters.
According to Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, Deputy Prime Minister for Security, at least the attacks by Hua Hin and Trang are connected.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators have been meant to destroy the country's tourism, because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy urges the Finns in the country to pay attention and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the authorities' instructions.
There is no reason for Finns to cancel their journey to Thailand because of the explosions, but it is worth heeding the advice of the great ambassador about caution, says Westphalen.
Europeans who have been wounded
So far, very little is known about the attacks that took place during the night in Finland and their victims.
A little more information about the attack last night in Hua Hin has been obtained.
A local woman died and more than 20 others were wounded, including at least nine foreign tourists.
There are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians among the wounded.
At least three people were wounded in Hua Hin's second attack.
Two bombs exploded near a bell tower known as a tourist attraction.
Thai PBS says the police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where they think they have found another bomb.
According to the governor of the province, Surat Than's bomb was hidden in a flowerbed.
An employee of the municipality died in the attack.
There's at least one wounded.
The CNN-interviewed police chief said that two bombs were also used in Surat Than's attack, which exploded about every half-hour.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles won the women's four-game
U.S. Alexandra Raisman was second with a score of 60.098, and Russian Alija Mustafina was third with a score of 58.665.
Biles, 18, is still in pursuit of stand championships on the floor, jumping and boom.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics as much as possible in recent years.
He has eight personal world championships from three previous seasons.
He has won the four-game and permanno championships three times in a row and the boom last year and the other year.
In the US team, Biles has achieved two world championships in the team competition.
The Biles have lower World Championship medals with jumps and booms.
Finnish entrepreneur in Thailand: "Isku has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand, and a children's play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of Thailand's bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I don't think there will be anything more amazing about this, estimates Huovila, who has worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about 20 years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many of the tragedies that have hit Thailand nearby.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then avian influenza, and last year there was a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these earlier ones haven't driven out the tourists, I don't think this has.
Huovila's office is located a few hundred metres from the site of the explosion.
Huovila heard about the attack from his own employee.
The employee called at about nine o'clock local time and said it's not worth coming to the office.
Huovila says both the promenade and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning because of the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been set for the Queen's birthday, Huovila said, referring to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open around 10 o'clock local time.
On the beach, many had not even heard of the attacks.
At 2:30 in the day, the traffic at Patong had normalised and a large part of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the point of impact, the explosion has been quite small, Huovila said.
Later, the car was seen in Kruunupyyy on Jouxholmintie.
When the police got there, the car was set on fire.
The patrol spotted two men that fit the description, hiding in a nearby spruce.
The other man was immediately apprehended.
One of them ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft, theft and gross damage to the use of a motor vehicle.
The police thank those who gave the clues.
Research director on Russian leadership changes: Clear removal
The highest-ranking leadership change was made in Russia on Friday in years, when President Vladimir Putin dismissed Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is Anton Vaino, 44 years old, with Estonian background.
He's an ex-diplomat and was Ivanov's number two.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov's dismissal could be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from gathering too much power.
He adds that recycling management tasks is one way of exercising power.
This is a way to prevent people from building power independent of the President for themselves.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been in trouble with other leaders or screwed up.
Post drop to Ivanov
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, will be transferred to special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
On a tape presented by the state media, Putin said the change was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had requested a transfer to another post and proposed Vaino to replace him, said Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says from Ivanov's point of view it is a clear drop in the station.
Environmental and transport issues in Russia are not very high in order of importance.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most significant people at the top of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet era.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, such as governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the Finnish Institute of Foreign Policy says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place is Putin's changing his circle to younger.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield when retreating in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to escape to the city of Jarabulus so we wouldn't aim at them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians had been placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters took control of about 90% of the city of Manbij, which is important to ISIS.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city.
Corrected earlier news at 7:30: Previously we mistold that civilians were fleeing from the city, actually Isis fighters kidnapped civilians while fleeing from the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior's document publicity policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on public access to documents is illegal, says Tomi Voutilainen, professor of public law at the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutilainen says to STT that document access cannot be based on the authority's own policies, but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants for the Minister of the Interior's events to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision with the instructions of the Government Office and the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting file.
The Ministry's Communications Director says to STT that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's final Olympic show begins in Rio
As in recent years, Bolt has been running against time under the ranks.
He hurt his back thighs from the early part of the season and had to skip Jamaica's Olympic qualifyings.
This has not been a perfect preparation, but I am in much better shape.
I've been practicing well, and that's the key, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included samba dancers and journalists turned into fans.
Porina Bolt emphasises that the Jamaican star has risen in the era of athletics struggling with doping scandals and sliding interest.
Bolt's previous defeat in the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he was eliminated in the early 200 metres in 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by injuries and a loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at a hundred metres, with which he crushed the world record and the self-confidence of rivals, despite the final party, at 9,69.
This is harder
A year later, in the Berlin World Championships, Bolt reached his career with a clock.
The world records from Berlin are still valid for 9,58 hundred metres and 19,19 200 metres.
In Rio, Bolt has announced a world record of 200 metres and 19 seconds below, but no one believes in its birth except Bolt himself.
In 100, Bolt's challenger is Justin Gatlin, the Olympic champion of the 100th Olympic Games in Athens 2004.
Last year in Beijing's World Championship final, Bolt defeated the American in just one hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost a single time in the title finals, if only he has made his way.
In Daegu 2011, Bolt missed the $100 World Championship final because of fraud.
Bolt turns 30 in over a week.
He is an old man in a young men's sport, and the Rio Games are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set next year's World Championship in London as the final goal line of the career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the others.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Reveals from Rio: two athletes suspected of doping offence
According to China's state news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi's doping sample found traces of banned substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of a doping offence.
In addition, a Kenyan athletics coach was sent home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of an athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
He was fourth in Rio in women's 100 metres butterfly swim.
According to Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has taken his doping case to the International Court of Appeal for Sports CAS.
Xinhua reports that the sample Xinyi gave on Sunday showed signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping suspicions have also emerged in Rio.
BBC reports that Bulgarian female obstacle runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
Kenya, on the other hand, has sent an athletics coach home from Rio because of a drug abuse.
The International Olympic Committee KOK said on Thursday that Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete in a test situation and had given a doping sample for him.
According to media information, it is Kenyan speed coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had used the racing pass of a 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich.
There's nothing stopping Phelps - historical gold came in the show style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, U.S. Michael Phelps, swam in a 200-metre mix in his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to achieve Olympic gold of the same sport in the fourth consecutive games.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino was second in the mix before China's Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have some fun, the BBC Olympic swim commentator Helen Skelton laughs at Iltalehti's quick interview.
The story about Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read on the Iltalehti website this week.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't put much stress on if there's a little noise in social media or the British press about his revealing and special outfits.
Television is a visual media, he emphasises.
Skelton is wearing high heels and a short dress with certainly at least enough exposure - to the eyes of at least many conservative British viewers.
However, there are no steps backwards.
It's important to look good, and small things are just fun.
I'm sure Skelton wants to startle you and perhaps even startle you, but he emphasises that he doesn't want to play the lead.
It's not about me, he says.
They're here to watch sports, and the focus has to be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the fuss has reached all the way to Finland?
I can't, but anything that points to how hard these swimmers work and how big the sacrifices they make is fine with me, Skelton grins.
You know what?
It's a fuss about nothing if it comes from dressing (the host).
I'm a little amused if someone's radar has been hit with something like this.
Rio Police made two arrests on suspicion of terror
Rio Police announced on Thursday that it has arrested two people for suspected terrorism.
The police made the arrests in connection with the security supervision of the games.
In the same connection, the police made five other arrests and questioned two persons before their release.
All suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news site, persons arrested for terrorism belong to the same group the police arrested already in July.
The arrested are believed to have ties to the Isis organisation.
The detainees had reportedly fuelled violence in social media.
Among other things, the popular WhatsApp service had been used to spread messages that called for violence.
85,000 police officers are responsible for the security of the Rio Games.
Police blew up a suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria had to start their first-string Rio basketball tournament match in an empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place to the audience.
The police let the audience in after they had controlledly detonated the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that police have carried out a controlled blasting mission.
The police closed the arena because of the suspicious package found there.
The crowd got in after police had controlledly detonated the package.
The crowd didn't make it to the stands by the beginning of the match, because the police closed the arena for a while because of the suspicious package found in the hall.
The police blew up the package and let the audience into the hall only after that.
The drink woke up the team of Spain, which had entered the games sleepyly.
Spain, which started the games with two defeats, won Nigeria with a score of 96-87.
In the previous two games Spain reached silver.
The police carried out a controlled blasting mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
Last time the police had to blow up a suspicious discovery near the road biking goal spot last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their first-string Rio basketball tournament in front of empty stands.
Argentinian dame pounded Petäjä-Siren - the Finnish was thinking about protest
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren had a colourful competition day in Rio.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren suffered hard on Thursday.
Argentina's dame kicked Tuuli Petäjä-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening of the women's surfing day.
The winds were clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the offence.
He got stuck because of the crash, and others ran away, said Joakim Wilenius, Finland's head coach.
The athlete considered protest for a long time.
It was not worth doing, because it would have been pointless, according to the Olympic rules.
I should have dropped in the water to get compensation," Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finn hung on his board to the last, because he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
With the crash, the Finn was left in 27th place.
In the overall situation, London's 2012 Olympic silver medalist is the eighth.
When it comes to the track, the crash didn't have much effect.
Friday is a big day when you have to race 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that, according to science, prolong age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring more years to a person's life.
Some of the things are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person's health so that his life lengthens.
Sometimes things that a person can't control themselves can bring him extra years.
These include the tendency to medium-body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can prolong your life.
You don't even have to spend it - just getting a can of milk is enough.
Many studies have been carried out to find out the secret of a long-term life.
Medical Daily presented seven of the most bizarre research results.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drinking has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
Harvard University's study found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a "reduced risk of death", especially with regard to neurological or cardiac diseases.
Again, alcohol is spoken for by studies that say that moderate use - from one to three daily meals - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular flossing can prolong a person's life for more than six years, says one study.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents gum infections.
They, on the other hand, can contribute to the onset of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway found out how laughing affected a person's life span.
The seven-year project watched over 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to be alive after the test ended.
Sex, when the protection against sexually transmitted diseases is considered, is good for your health, according to many studies.
In addition, it can also extend your age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years in his life, he or she should also have an orgasm.
The exercise, of course, will bring additional years, and that will not be disputed.
However, reaching a long age does not require absolute slackness.
One Oxford University study found that women with large butts had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their system.
The same study combined these factors with lower mortality.
Whether it's an athlete or an Oscar-winning actor who got to medals in the Olympics, he's more likely to live longer than an ordinary bungee.
Many studies have tried to find the reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will add years to his or her life.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that the long life is due to the person's social status - which, for its part, makes it possible to seek recognition such as the Nobel Prize.
A study investigating the shopping behaviour of people over 65 found that a person who shops daily was likely to be older than those who shop less often.
This is because running in concrete shops reduces loneliness.
It has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may lead to early death.
So count your credit card from your hand - online shopping does not, therefore, have the same effect.
A drunk driver who was drunk at the end of the night fell into a lorry
On Friday evening a serious truck and car head-on accident took place in Kosko, Southwest Finland.
The accident took place in Koskella, midway between Koskentie and Sorvastontie on Friday at 9 pm.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car that arrived had drifted into the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the crash, the truck was left in its lane, but it caught fire.
The driver managed to put out the fire himself.
The passenger car derailed into a ditch and then passed over the ditch to its roof.
A woman born in 1972 who drove a passenger car was squeezed in her car.
The rescue department removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to Turku University Hospital for treatment.
The result of the female breath test was 2.02 per mil.
He's suspected of aggravated drunken driving.
Posti sent loose candy to the wrong town
Salon K-Citymarket's loose candy selection was incomplete because the mail had accidentally delivered part of the load to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was buying bulk candy at Salo's K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product defects in bulk confectionery because Posti delivered our load to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when Posti gets the load delivered!
So if there is no traffic in the lawn cutting, the sign said.
The store's foxy sign is related to Posti expanding its services last spring to include lawnmowers.
Weed cutting is on Posti's offer until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing and decided to share it in social media.
I was struck by the popularity of the update.
Representatives of the media have been calling all the time, and the attention that this raises is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia's update had over 700 splits on Facebook.
Haltia was able to grab her favourites into a bag of candy, even though a few laers were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who is responsible for the business of Posti's Companies Transport Services, apologized for the damage to Ilta-Sanomis.
The background is that three of the five pallets got lost in the wrong place yesterday (Säinäjoki) and we stopped doing part delivery (Saloon) in three, but only took five pallets today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
The first news was from Ilta-Sanomat.
Teija Haltia was not indignant about the sign, because she found all her favourite bulk candy in the selection.
Drunk weight loss! 30 kilos lighter Lotta Backlund released a picture of her change
The comedian producer has thinned tens of kilos since the birth of her child.
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of kilos as a result of the change in life.
Lotta shared a picture pair on Friday about her change in Instagram.
Lotta was on a fitness course in the spring and was aiming for normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund started her weight loss work already in 2009.
He has lost about 30 kilos of weight in a comprehensive lifestyle change.
On Friday, Backlund released a pair of pictures of his incredible performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed in appearance over the years.
Backlund's before and after photo pair has gathered several praiseworthy comments from co-sweaters.
You're amazing, though.
On the same journey, motivation is hard!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the "Do It Now" project.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures, as I go on the same journey myself, the other says.
In the spring Lotta dropped the last kilos on the "Do It Now" project.
At that time he told Iltalehti he wanted to finally reach the normal weight, which was then 10 kilos away.
During a three-month fitness course, five kilos eventually fell.
The family's wish for a woman murdered in Loviisa: remembering the victim for police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim will be remembered not with flowers and petitions, but with a donation for police dog work.
Sipoo Veterinarian Centre has released a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim's family's wish for donations to police dogs.
The publication says that the victim had worked as a substitute at Sipoo Veterinarian Station and also had her nursing training there.
The veterinary clinic recalls the woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, with a sense of humor and a fear of work.
Dear Friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update states that the donation money goes to police dogs in its entirety, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisa woman was murdered in her own home yard in Koskenkylä, Loviisa.
The woman's neighbors have said to Iltalehti the victim was a very animal lover.
He owned several animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens and rooster.
The 27-year-old man suspected of murder did not know the woman and they had no connection.
Police dog Börje was involved in the killer's tracking, and he was wounded in a life-threatening situation.
Börje, however, survived and is recovering.
The District Court sentenced Posti for violating the Equality Act
Posti did not have the right to retain the salary of the employee who refused to familiarise the temporary worker, estimates the District Court of Kanta-Häme in its ruling.
The District Court required Posti to pay the employee most of the wages withheld and €2,000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the sentence, Posti could have withheld only part of the initiator's salary that corresponded to the part of the introductory work throughout the day.
According to the District Court, the employee had been put at a disadvantage on the basis of his trade union activity, contrary to the Equality Act.
The employee had followed the PAU's organisation decision to ban the introduction of the Post and Logistics Union.
During last November's postal strike, PAU made a decision not to familiarise Posti employees with temporary workers who break the strike.
People's News first told about the matter.
Turkey's return to the path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights development, written by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (p.a.) in their response to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
Earlier in a letter, the Journalist Association asked Sipilä and Soin to express their concerns about Turkish freedom of speech and press.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland has repeatedly highlighted the importance of press and speech freedom for Turkey.
Putin dismissed the chief of his administration - replaced by Vaino of Estonian origin
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed Sergei Ivanov, head of the presidential administration, says the Kremlin.
Soviet-Estonia Communist leader Karl Vaino's grandson Anton Vaino will take over.
Vaino is a 44-year-old former diplomat, who has been the deputy chief of the presidential administration since 2012.
Vaino will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, says Interfax news agency.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, will be transferred to special tasks in environmental and transport matters, according to the Kremlin press release.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had requested a transfer to another post and proposed Vaino to replace him, says Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era in KGB espionage.
Many considered Ivanov a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed president in 2011 before Putin was re-elected in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant buy-in to a no-play - will not be seen in the opening of the Champion League
The world record man for football transfers will not be seen on the field when England's Champion League is kicked off at the weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban was accompanied to England.
Manchester United's giant purchase Paul Pogba is sidelined as ManU opens its league season on Sunday against Bournemouth, said the BBC on Friday.
According to British media, ManU paid 105 million euros for Pogba to the Italian club Juventus.
However, the English Football Federation FA keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was burdened with a ban on Juventus.
He received two warnings in last season's Italian cup, and it becomes a one-game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, FA told BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is the league's second round on August 19, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, grandeur is a virtue
The exact criteria and ambitious visions of entertainment have established Flow Festival's position as an internationally respected event starred by world's top artists.
Flow Festival will begin on Friday in Helsinki.
Festarians have typically expressed themselves with a distinctive dress.
One of the main stage artists this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is styled with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to have just a main stage and a beer tent, says the artistic director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival in Suvilahti, Helsinki, this weekend has grown from a small block festival to an event of tens of thousands of visitors.
There is a simple question behind the success: What kind of event would the authors themselves want to go to?
It's quite unusual in event production to think like this.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities, says the artistic director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow was going to sell out again this year.
The goal has been to increase last year's 70,000 visitors by 5,000 people.
The festival will also have a series of interesting Finnish and foreign artists this year.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because the work needs to be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we don't want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle being steered on huge routes.
We don't want that.
For 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been magnified, with 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurant points and drinks bars in a partially artificial grassed area.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stage, this year's venue is a tent for 15,000 people.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a bit grandiose, but at the same time we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If you lose it, this isn't our thing anymore.
For Kallio, the greatest joy and reward for the work done is that even great visions are now possible in practice.
In the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, the operations were very dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki of around 20,000 euros.
Last year, the company running Flow had a turnover of about six million euros.
It can be used to produce even "creative things", such as building that 73-metre-wide tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves with a distinctive dress.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not deliberately profiled itself to be particularly fashionable.
Above all, we want to stand out with content.
Still, fashion phenomena also fit Flow's values: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year one of the main stage artists is punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer at the festival that combines indierock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because it's probably the last time we see this at a gig in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
It's not just what's on the commercial radio.
Iggy's latest record is damn good, and he's been doing a hell of a job in recent years.
The bombs in Thailand's tourist paradise were hidden in flower pots - tourists fled in terror
On Thursday evening, two bombs exploded in Hua Hin.
At least one local woman died in the attack and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and detonated with cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreign.
They were detonated at the same time as tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, according to police spokesman Samoer Yoosumran CNN.
Since 1989, Edwin Wiek, a wildlife protector living in Asia, tweeted a talkative picture of the attacks.
If the tweet doesn't show properly, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran up against me and said the bomb exploded at the bars.
It happened in one of the biggest bars, said Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson to Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after that, two bombs exploded on Phuket Island, which was favoured by the Finns.
No one reportedly died.
At the same time, there was another double bomb attack in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were wounded.
In addition, a bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
The police reportedly found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely rebel forces behind the bombings who are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, police have recently taken up the activities of criminal organisations that traffic in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new stand-by forces goes first to battle in a war situation
In an acute war situation, the conscripts are not ordered to fight until several months after the military oath was taken, says Central Finns.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, the head of training in the Defence Forces interviewed by the newspaper, for example, of the conscripts serving 5.5 months in a war situation, only those who are in the final stages of their training are able to fight.
According to the head of training, the first thing they do is assign the reserve members of the stand-by teams.
None of the conscripts or reservists are ordered to perform a task that has not been trained as required, says Sonninen.
Earlier in the summer, it appeared that the Defence Forces will begin to train the conscripts in the units of immediate readiness from next year.
The units can be used for military operations already during military training, if necessary.
Pamela Tola got the giant compensation for the mold house
Actress Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough fight over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of a two-storey separate house had been €330,000.
After the sale, however, the house revealed a serious moisture problem that caused a microbial growth that was dangerous to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in a condition for demolition in 2014.
The sales price had dropped to 132,000 euros, so the financial losses to Tola and Waroma amounted to as much as 198 000 euros.
The couple took the case to court and there demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case at both the District Court and the Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal ruled on Wednesday.
It upheld the District Court's ruling ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma a price reduction of €150,000.
In addition, the seller has to pay a total of 47 344 euros for the couple's trial and settlement costs.
The right moderated the price reduction slightly, because the buyers had already known some of the need to repair the dwelling at the time of the home sale.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the building defects that appeared were essentially more serious than what had been presented.
Tola was looking for a home in good condition
Tola said in the Court of Appeal that the couple had specifically looked for a home in good condition because they didn't want to go to repairs.
He had been given the impression that the building was renovated and in good condition and that there was no harm in the elements mentioned in the fitness check report.
The fitness inspection report mentioned ventilation as risks and defects, and the fact that the management of rain and melting waters running along the rock surface is not sufficient.
However, the discussions did not reveal that it was an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma were left under the impression that rainwater from the rock should perhaps be controlled slightly in a few years.
The deal was made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became apparent that the moisture problems in the dwelling were much more serious than expected.
The inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 revealed microbe growths that, according to witnesses, were caused by both the rainwaters of the rock and the capillaryly raised ground humidity.
On the west side of the house, the inspector estimated that the air contaminated by microbes could also enter the interior via the porch.
Healthy-risk mold or yeast above limit values were found in brush samples in the housekeeping room, basement staircase, living room window isolation and basement washroom.
The terraces were built without permission
The court also argued whether the apartment had been extended in violation of the building permit.
The court ruled that Tola and Waroma were not aware of Espoo City's decision to change the dwelling against the permit before the sale.
For example, the terraces were built, even though there were no proper permits yet.
But home problems were a key issue in court.
According to the Court of Appeal, on the basis of information obtained from the seller before the sale, the buyers could assume that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for extensive repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma felt there was no particular reason for the Court of Appeal to carry out a larger inspection than usual.
Buyers have not neglected their reporting duty, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Creepy archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to have children for Nazis - also Finns in the register
Journalist Christopher Andersson writes in a recent article by Dagens Nyheter, how the National Archives in Maryland in the United States have recorded documents about a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but they are also American, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian, 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to be Nazi brides.
The documents and registration cards come from a race agency in Nazi Germany.
The Race Agency served under SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true even more for women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, women were subjected to gynaecological studies to investigate the matter.
The race agency investigated women's backgrounds, among other things, by studying church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and give the race agency handwritten biographies and good recommendations from close friends.
The race agency wanted guarantees that women were "child lovers", "saved", and "good National Socialists" who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as SS men's brides.
The story does not say what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created a state-supported programme known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program provided that every SS man should have four children, either in or outside the marriage.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the programme was not very actively promoted, according to the United States Holocaust Museum website.
Instead, Nazi demographic policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged getting married by offering loans and supported having children.
The German mother's Cross of Honor was granted to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum's website states.
Petäjä-Sire's sixth, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third in the first race of Finnjollie's day in the Rio Olympic Games, but remained the top of the whole team in the second race of the day.
Nirkko rose to eighth in the overall situation after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to 14th.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren fought at the departures of RS:X class 17 and three.
Petäjä-Siren is sixth in the overall situation.
In the 470-class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren were left in 23 at the start of the day.
In the overall situation, the Lindgrens are ranked 19.
Jari Sillanpää's Satulinna was recorded in a couple of hours' sleep: "I was so hungover"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of the favourite Finnish artists for over 20 years.
Sillanpää, who has reached the top of the cruise ship's bar as the 1995 tango king, the best-selling solo artist in Finland, and the star of dance platforms and festivals, is still able to pork, and he is currently in a frantic lift.
The book Jari Sillanpää, written by Mari Koppinen, about the life of the favourite singer, was published today on Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää tells about his life and career in both good and bad.
Sillanpää's career rose to total praise as he won the tango king's crown in the Seinäjoki Tango market in 1995.
In the competition Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already planned some different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango song for Sillanpää at the man's request, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different shape.
Satulinna was one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and after just a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so hungover!
Sillanpää remembers in the book.
You wouldn't immediately guess from recording a song that became a huge hit that it was sung in a hangover.
Even though I wasn't physically at my best, the mark was still good.
I learned that you don't have to insist on being perfect and top-notch all the time.
The second incident related to the man's most popular songs, which the book describes, happened almost 20 years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his then partner, and the case eventually ended up in the texts of "You Earn Gold" that were published as a single in 2014.
The book says that the songs ordered from Saara Törmössä were not as Sillanpää would have liked.
Sillanpää had imagined he was making a record that tells a true story about his own life, but the words of the song about the divorce were not true, but were written on the basis of a 7-day news report.
In the newspaper's news, Jari and his ex-lover broke up because of Jari's excessive partying and drinking, but Jari said it was a total nonsense and wasn't true.
According to the book, Jari was furious with the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and that's good.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52 per cent of voters were in favour of the resignation and 48 per cent would have stayed in the Union, even though polls during the voting week predict the opposite result.
Britain's economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous about staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flaged for divorce, even though a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme of the U.S. former president Bill Clinton's recent election campaign, "It's the economy, stupid" flew into a wreck in Britain's Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic curly language
The Centre for Macroeconomics, in its latest monthly survey, is looking for answers from the professional community to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economists were not listened to, because this time voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation of economists for the loss of economic status is that people don't understand the economy.
Many still have the illusion that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people working, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's off the right Brit.
Many also have the impression that a drop in the value of the currency would be a good thing, as it promotes the export industry.
According to the Economists, voters did not believe the economic arguments, because the consensus of economists did not come up sufficiently.
The BBC's level playing field, which gave only a couple of percent of economists in favour of the EU's difference, gave them the same space as the overwhelming majority.
The anti-EU press was not interested to tell what the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other powerful economic combinations about the consequences of the separation felt.
Those distant letter combinations spoke facelessly about economic growth, trade relations, sovereign debt and currency.
And if the economists' messages were both listened to and understood, they were ignored, because economists represent an elite with whom voters feel they have no common interests.
The academics in big cities, such as economists, would have stayed in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas, the message did not work.
Immigration is also an economy
The overwhelming profit motive of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
The immigrant will take your job, the immigrant will jam your hospital, the immigrant will take advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
There are foreign employees in every cafe.
How many more jobs would the Britons have if they left?
You can see immigrants in the waiting room of every health centre.
How much easier would it be for Britain to get medical appointments if they didn't exist?
Every school has immigrant children, too.
How much easier would it be for the children of a real Brit to get a place to go to school if they were to be rid of them?
There are foreigners living in every municipality.
How much more space would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond to them, and if they did, their answers did not get visibility.
Economists failed to explain that the immigrants have more jobs, fewer health centre queues and more money for education and social security.
Migrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to British public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen real estate fund prepared for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, Aberdeen prepared for Brexit in time by drawing up plans A and B.
A few weeks before the vote, in case the result was left, the plan B, the victory of the camp supporting the EU break-up, began to be prepared more closely.
The concern was that investors would begin to withdraw their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large liquid assets, but they could be needed now.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd, we had 25 per cent of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says about Aberdeen's only open daily real estate fund, which was the subject of the news.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20 per cent.
At the time, the fund was worth £3.5 billion.
The total value of the company's funds is about £20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all the open real estate funds in Britain.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was 10 per cent or even below.
So the real estate funds prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
The funds closed the deal
When the camp that supported the EU split won, Europe went crazy.
However, the less than two weeks after the vote in the real estate market were quite calm, says Vanhanen.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, who estimated that Brexit could be a big risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trade.
Together, they robbed the situation and brought the matter to the headlines of the Financial Times and BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball began to spin, and the fund after fund had to close its doors.
Aberdeen's situation was good because of the cash collected, but it also eventually had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually close the deal, but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, investors were given time, he said, to consider whether the money should now be thrown out in a panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it won't pay because it would cost you.
It calmed the situation, and most of them withdrew the announcement.
Since then it has been quite steady, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, says Vanhanen.
He points out that, for example, there has been no such turmoil in Aberdeen's Continental European funds.
However, there were a lot of inquiries.
Excessive attention to real estate funds
Vanhanen said the closures of real estate funds received excessive attention.
The open funds that were affected by the closures dominate about four per cent of Britain's real estate.
Aberdeen's closure lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties out of 80 of its London properties.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned their investors this week that it might keep its funds closed to the side of 2017.
At the moment there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been torn downwards, but the situation does not look more "hopeful" to Aberdeen.
The biggest questions now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even created new opportunities for some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The price of pound and dollar is lowest in 30 years, and there is a 15 percent discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property for up to 30 per cent cheaper.
There are many willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit's activities in the London real estate market
At two o'clock in the morning, things didn't look so good yet.
But at four o'clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, who is responsible for real estate investments at Aberdeen Asset Management, in the British real estate fund, woke up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the power word.
I realized that this is now going to plan B," Vanhanen says in his other home in Helsinki.
He immediately headed to work.
London City was already completely alive, despite the morning.
The TV screens that were normally set to be silent at the office were squealing the news, and the normally loud people were completely silent to listen as Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell about his resignation.
When the market opened, the screen terminals flashed just red.
It was one of those mornings you never thought you'd be alive, says Vanhanen.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain's largest real estate funds, finished two real estate deals the day after the Brexit vote, the Midsummer.
The atmosphere was confused.
However, the company was well prepared for the option, which is why the situation was kind of calm, says Vanhanen.
The Brexit vote started a correction
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, Britain's leadership went into change.
The market began to anticipate drastic falls in the real estate market in Britain and London in particular.
The London office premises were expected to have losses of up to 20 percent in the coming years.
Soon a group of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the wet has subsided, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it doesn't show up on Vanhanen's face, who spent his last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
He thinks it is far too early to say much about Brexit.
So much remains open: how the separation will happen and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
First information on the development of the London real estate market has already been received.
CBRE's information on price developments covers about a third of the market.
According to them, all London real estate prices fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City office buildings, the minus was 6.1 per cent, says Vanhanen.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and there have been worse figures in only five months, says Vanhanen.
All the equally large drops hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting, too, because Brexit was very quickly compared to Lehman's fall and the global economic crisis that began in the U.S. real estate market.
Vanhanen thinks the comparison is not quite apt, because this is a home-grown crisis in Britain.
The atmosphere is different, too.
The real estate market has not now seen panic sales like that, but the willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
There is also financial support as usual.
The repair movement could have been ahead of us anyway
In fact, the price adjustment is not a miracle to him - it could have been there even without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen's estimate, the real estate prices of London and other top cities in the world have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City, and especially the offices, are overpriced, says Vanhanen.
So the drop started really high.
London's prices have tightened up for four reasons, Vanhanen's list.
Britain's economy has grown strongly, as has London's population.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership that is globalised, says Vanhanen.
New players have emerged from the Middle East and Asia, and more institutions and even private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London, as a known city, is an easy target.
In addition, prices have been fuelled by low interest rates, which has forced pension companies, for example, to seek returns on new targets.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although Vanhanen said the leverage has been used now clearly less than during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
Decentralize, decentralize
In London, the price increase was levelled out last summer, says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen also began to lighten its holdings in London, and was a net seller last year.
There was some kind of change to be expected, and here it is.
So, what's the next step?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says Vanhanen.
He does not dare to estimate much of the future, but says that there is hardly going to be any peaks.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a downward or steady process ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen several moves up and down, since he has been in real estate since 1988.
And he's still an optimist, who thinks they can work through the pits.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you've invested in one market, you're too much of a victim.
If you have decentralised, the risks are also decentralised, says Vanhanen.
S Group begins to register shop information more closely
Soon the S Group will know what you're eating, as the trading group said today it will begin to collect more accurate information about the purchases of its regular customers.
So far, once the information has been gathered about the total amount of the receipt, the group will begin in early May to harass it also about the products purchased.
The S Group follows Kesko here, because the information on the goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to K-Plus Oy's CEO, Ismo Riitala, the feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the customer's consent and is used for marketing on a licensed basis.
The most effective channel is email.
Quite a few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala says to Taloussanom.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to the change in registration of the S Group.
Kesko already classes its regulars according to grocery shopping to ten groups.
The classification is updated monthly.
Stock customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The information is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase information is collected only from K Group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not give up their information.
Lidl Finland does not have a customer loyalty programme and there is no such programme planned for the time being.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own Onesbonus customer loyalty programme, which can be associated with in Valtitalo, Siwo and Euromarkets.
At the moment, we do not collect information about product or product group levels, we stick to the total amount of the receipt.
So we know which store the purchases were made and on what day and the customer's receipt total.
We have not gone to the level of the K-Group or the S-Group, says commercial director Anu Ora.
According to him, the loyalty programme will be reformed in the future, but Lähikauppa will report on the matter later.
However, Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
Initially, an experiment
So far, SOK's customer ownership and customer register has been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal and address information, the basic information has included occupation, education, form of living, the years of birth of children and previous personal data.
The persons belonging to the same economy and their role have also been registered.
The date and time of the purchase, the place, the total amount of the purchases and the method of payment have been recorded from the S-Etucard purchase.
In addition, information from S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase information will be stored in Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prismos, Kodin Terras and ABC chains, the data is currently recorded at product group level.
For a long time, customers have been hoping to be more focused on marketing, says Marjaana Saarikoski, head of customer ownership and partner operations at SOK.
The S Group says it will inform its customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data will be stored in the cashiers anyway, whether they want it or not.
The willing person can check their stored information on the S Group website.
For example, the cashiers cannot access the information, says Saarikoski.
Video: Heila puppy is Customs' newest dog confirmation - the puppy will be the first explosive dog
Black Labrador retriever's puppy vigorously sniffs five similar boxes lined up in the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long before it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog to play it with its favourite toy.
The box heila sat next to revealed a jar of shell casings for the powder gas.
Gunpowder gas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, the owner of the dog Heila.
Security situation and main reasons for e-commerce
Heila is Customs' first dog specialising in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossings and ports if necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila's main place of work, because the international security situation has changed as a result of serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused action in Customs, and since the attacks, surveillance has been strengthened, says Customs Chief Inspector-General Mikko Grönberg.
The second main reason for training a gun and explosive dog for Customs tasks is postal deliveries via Helsinki Airport.
As a result of the growing internet deal, up to 40 million postal items pass through the airport every year, including arms supplies and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made about 300 findings related to weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives and their precursors from online shopping, passenger plane baggage and air cargo at Helsinki Airport.
Heila will work across Helsinki Airport.
It will investigate registered luggage and mail.
In the future, it will be a big benefit in ports when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on Heila's performance, Customs will assess whether more gun and explosive dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is hopeful about the idea.
School at Kirkkonummi
Heila puppy training is coordinated by Customs dog school in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also visits police and Defence Forces experts to train with Heila.
The police have strong experience in dog training and the Defence Forces has expertise in explosives.
Together with other authorities, Customs decides what smells Heila is taught to recognise.
Heila is always further trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Tull's six drug dogs, as well as the cash and drug dog Massi.
Labrador retriever Heila has been selected from a litter of ten puppies.
The selection criteria for the dog chosen for the airport include briskness and hunting instinct, as well as calmness, because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human streams.
Heila, who lives at Suntio's home, is a close co-worker for the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can't go anywhere without Heila at home, Suntio laughs.
The subtle orders go to Heila for a one-time deal.
The Ilta-Sanomie cameraman loses the camera mic cover to a fast dog, but Heila returns the soft-toy cover immediately from the "move" order.
Hard competition for work dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, the next in October, to assess whether the training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heila can be seen working at Helsinki Airport next year, if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come and iron a dog wearing a work vest, says Suntio.
The cost of one work dog is about 60,000-70,000 euros a year for Customs.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to their owners.
The working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active contributions last from only 10 minutes to a couple of hours.
The owner of the work dogs is a tough competition in Customs.
About 20-30 Customs employees applied to own Heila.
The luck hit Suntio, who has never had a work dog before, but he has years of experience in dogs and surveillance tasks in Customs.
Mini-state got its first Olympic medal - the people get a day off
The Olympic gold of Fiji with less than a million inhabitants in rugby is valued so high in the country that the government has decreed August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the country's broadcaster, Fiji's government confirmed the matter after the championship was over.
The day off is taken the day after the team's return home.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
Fiji's rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian says the country followed the final in Suva, the capital, where a screen had been set up for the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game linked our multicultural community.
Even in Chinese restaurants the game was watched, I heard them encouraging, said Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru to the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - a Finnish lifter fainted after a wild performance
The weight lifter Milko Tokola managed his last attempt for 175 kilos after a tough fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature for a lifter.
During or immediately after heavy liftings, he has passed out many times.
No one has really been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola scored 175 kilos of push and 145 kilos of pull.
His combined result was 320 kilos.
Tokola tried to get his last push 175 kilos, as did one.
In the third attempt, the weights rose with a frantic roar.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury approved the lift.
The Finnish lifter's joy was accompanied by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired Estonian attacker Prosan - Veikkausliika - Ilta-Sanomat
Rovaniemi Ball Society, who plays in the Men's Football League, has concluded a long-term contract with Estonian attacker Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a leading player in our team with power and a small threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi.
We went through over 50 players from around the world with more than ten players.
Gradually, Prosa began to stand out as a good option, as RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a press release.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Tallinna Flora, where she scored 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played in the Estonian national team.
Prosa is due to be with RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemiers meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new attacker when last season's goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
The Brave Modern Family Star shones again: Teenager Star shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who has become a good friend of the Modern Family comedy series Alex Dunphy, is once again exasperating by showing off her pompous body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
Shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also his ass.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing her style and behaviour considerably more courageous.
The star has posed in pictures published in social media with very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very tight outfits.
Winter, who is on the threshold of adulthood, has also recently published several pictures of herself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can see it here.
Earlier this summer Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its image so radically.
At that time, the founder and CEO of PowerwomanTV, Amy Palmer, suspected Winter was experiencing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television almost his whole life and has grown up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more you look at the surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series when she was only 11 years old.
The actor has resented some of her long-term fans with her image change.
It's not hard to guess where she will be in ten years, when the downhill is already so hard, says one woman on Winter Instagram.
Some of the women's fans, on the other hand, defend the actor and advise them not to care about criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what people say.
You're an inspiration to many women, a young woman is gloating.
Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted to the aurora: In the autumn it is possible to see a fairy-tale mirror aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to start the aurora trips already in early autumn, Visit Finland says in a press release.
The main destinations of the Japanese aurora tourism are Inari and Levi.
Northern lights are the assets of our winter travel, and they are strongly associated with heart winter and snowy landscapes.
There is a high demand for winter aurora trips in Lapland, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the aurora season starts early in the autumn and goes far into the spring.
In the autumn it is possible to see the so-called "mirror aurora", where the lake surface reflects the aurora, making the vision double-folded, says Visit Finland's Acting Marketing Manager Anne Lind.
The main target group of Visit Finland's aurora campaign is the wealthy 25-35-year-olds, Japanese women living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising, for example.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and Turku and Tokyo universities, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive land image among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would long for clearer unique attractions from Finland, and this is where the aurora has enormous potential, according to Lind.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists in Finland have grown clearly more than other Nordic countries.
Last year they spent more than twice as much in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interesting for Finnish tourism as a target group because they spent over 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, says Lind.
Britain settles for rugby silver as Fid's master course leads to gold
Britain's impressive advance in the rugby tournament collapsed in Fiji's final challenge at the final on Thursday night, when the team suffered a 43-7 crushing defeat at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji set up a master course in handling, bitings, evasiveness, support, running lines and sheer strength in winning gold - their first Olympic medal.
The loss brought moderate comfort from the silver medal - Britain's third day - and they were proud of their hard work in the Olympic rugby start-up tournament, where they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The heavy 7-5 victory over South Africa by the semi-finals played earlier that day may have bothered them in the final.
But despite this, Fidi would have won a team of 15 in this condition.
The fact that at least one Brit has a gold medal around his neck tomorrow may - but probably not - comfort the UK: Fid's chief coach is Ben Ryan, former British boss from Wimbledon.
It's been quite a trip for Britain.
Eight years ago, they were coached by Ryan to lose every game in Adelaide's tournament.
Here they lost only one.
This beating hurts, but the development is startling.
Fidi started out excellently, rejecting UK tackles for fun.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, this was like running into moving buses, and world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolisau dived in the corner to the finish line.
When the clock was four minutes away, Jerry Tuwai's second touchdown on the right side led to a goal kick.
12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant tackle stopped male-mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring the third goal, but it was just a delay for Fid.
At seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored in the right corner, and Great Britain was 17-0 down.
Nakarawa scored another start, and there was still more than a minute left on the clock... from the first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou plunged through Britain's wild tackles and rushed to the line to score a goal.
After the goal kick, the situation at the break was 29-0.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while Great Britain was just learning the game.
And that is actually the case.
During the break, Great Britain made a lot of changes that blocked Fid's dam... for a whole four minutes, which was good compared to the first half time, until Joshua Tuisova scored after Fid's impressive pitch game.
Dan Norton scored a touchdown in the left corner and narrowed the score to 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the islanders of the South Sea, whose supporters sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was hard not to admire Fid's joyful approach.
Mata Viliame with her last-minute goal was frosting in Fid's cake, which did not need frosting.
The whistle was whistled, the Fidians hugged, and Great Britain fell on the grass, completely beaten.
Earlier in the same day, Fidi had beaten Japan in semifinals 20-5, and Britain won South Africa in a tight semifinal, where both scored one goal - Britain's goal kick solved the game.
Kyle Brown took South Africa to the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the goal area with stunning footwork and scored under the goal poles in the second half.
A great late tackle from Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother of England's 15-aside rugby team, secured a victory and finally a silver medal.
The coach's fight against cancer led Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to a rowing victory
There will be no more emotional gold in these games, and that really means something.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found deeper meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa, from the first draft to the last, 220 hard strokes towards history books.
Even though they rowed alone, there were three voices on the boat, the echo of Coach Robin Williams was present all the time, as the duo swung into his second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's pairing contest - the first women in the history books of British sport that achieved such an achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance as unbeatable, which is also record-breaking.
This, what we see, two brilliant athletes connecting on the surface with swan grace, does not fully reflect the nature of victory.
Each rowing gold is based on a group of helpful pairs of hands that gradually promote the things that matter, and no pair of hands was as essential as a coach who, 30 months ago, did not know if he would live to this day.
As he said, the situation was close.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things they can operate on, and they performed the surgery.
If they don't operate, it will spread everywhere.
It could have been pretty bad.
It'll change your thinking a bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was fortunate to have been able to begin her treatment in early 2014 outside the season, when they caused as little interference as possible - if that expression can ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and I walked around the ward - 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing in itself is a journey, but it makes it a bit bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the first thing the couple thought was Williams, who had had a nervous morning, and he had spoken a little more than usual, trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, captain of the Royal Artillery regiment of Afghanistan's command, said: "I've been an emotional wreck this week, which may be a bit overreaction, but this means so much to me."
It just highlights how important this is to me, how hard Helen and I have worked, and Robin too.
The past three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so he has a lot of thanks, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost the competition in five years.
The couple set a heavy rhythm that their rivals couldn't reach.
Even at the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Denmark teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in storage.
We were very close in the moment.
Helen shouted "stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't try to do anything special.
We weren't looking for fireworks today, we were just trying to get good rowing and win the race, and we did.
A couple will wait a year before deciding their future.
Glover will attend the wedding next month when he marries TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last race.
It would have put too much pressure on you.
After London it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
Here it lasted about four minutes.
This feels so much better," he said.
Iceland will change the government of Panama leaks
Iceland will organise early parliamentary elections in October, which the protesters infuriated by the Panama data leaks demanded already in the spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed several Icelandic politicians to have evaded taxes using tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but that was not enough for the protesters.
His successor Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson promised then to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
Election Day has now been decided on October 29th.
Analysts say it's hard to predict how much the people's rage last spring will affect the result of the autumn election.
In June's presidential elections, criticalness towards those in power was clearly evident, and Gudni Johannesson, who had been nominated from outside politics, was elected president.
Trump said he was being sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of ISIS
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump withdrew his latest tumults.
He said he was being sarcastic when he claimed that sitting President Barack Obama was the founder of the terrorist organisation Isis and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was also involved in setting up the organisation.
The Democratic Party was furious about the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
You should never let anyone who can sink down that low as chief of the army, Clinton tweeted.
In the south of France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of the Muslim-like burkini bathing suit on beaches, for example, according to the British newspaper Guardian.
A decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that it is forbidden to go to the beaches and swim for anyone who has no good manners and a bathing suit that respects secularism.
The decision also states that swimsuits, which extantly express religious ties, can increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice, when a 31-year-old man drove to a crowd celebrating the French National Day.
At the end of July, two men connected to the extremist organization Isis attacked a church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
The quality of the bathing waters in the Oulu region passed through the sieve - At Pyykösjärvi, the sea of blue algae
Water samples taken from official beaches in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Blue algae opacity has been observed only on the shore of Lake Pyykösjärvi.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environmental Action took water samples from nine EU beaches in the Oulu region and 30 other public beaches.
With the exception of the shore of Meriniemi, the levels of E. coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in all bathing areas were below the action limits laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E. coli and enterococci concentrations in the sea-going beach were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial levels had fallen below the action limit.
The blue algae opacity found on the shore of Lake Pyykösjärvi does not yet make the water unfit for swimming, but under favourable conditions the situation can quickly turn into a blue algae bloom, resulting in blue-green algae mass forming on the surface of the water.
The environmental action will monitor the situation with more frequent inspections.
If the blue algae opacity turns into a blue algae flower, it will also be announced separately on the beach's notice board.
Check the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK's Hakkarainen forest gift reduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside
The forest gift deduction is one tax change in the Ministry of Finance's budget proposal for next year.
A tax deduction is proposed to the Income Tax Act, which would be granted on the basis of a gift tax on the generation change of forest holdings.
In the Ministry of Finance's proposal, the forest gift reduction has four goals: to promote generational changes in forest holdings, to rejuvenate forest owners' age structure, to increase forest space size and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry's goal is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would make a deduction from the clean capital income of forestry.
The idea of making such a tool to promote generational changes in forest holdings is a good one, comments Juha Hakkarainen, Director of Forests of the Federation of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, Hakkarainen finds criticism in the tax change proposal.
A forest gift deduction is proposed for the forest owner's pure capital income.
It is a capital income from which all other deductions have been deducted.
MTK and Hakkarainen felt that the tax deduction would be more effective if the deduction could be made directly from the wood's sales income.
VM's proposal starts from the fact that by making a deduction from the clean capital income of forestry, it will prevent a loss of the forest's capital income that would be deducted from other taxes.
Such a person would receive tax benefits even if he did not sell wood.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner is unable to understand it, says Hakkarainen.
In addition, he said the model only applies to a small number of forest owners.
The tax deduction limit, which is linked to the forest's yield value, is 40,000 euros in the proposal.
It's too high in Hakkarainen's mind.
As such, he said, it will cut 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners out of the deduction.
The model would have an effect on about 10 per cent of forest owners, he says.
The VM considers that the border guarantees the goal of increasing the size of the farm.
According to Hakkarainen, forest gift reduction has taken decades in forest policy.
It is based on the aging of forest owners.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is now over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful hailstorm surprised the drivers in Himanga - two cars derailed into a ditch and ran into each other
A special chase took place on Friday morning in Himanga, Kalajoki.
According to the rescue department, two cars in a row were derailed in a ditch, after which the one in the rear hit the one in front of the driver.
According to Harri Pyhtää, the on-call fire master, the ditch is suspected to have been caused by a heavy hailstorm.
There were two people in the car behind, both of whom were taken to hospital for treatment.
There is no more accurate information about their injuries.
The driver of the car that was driving ahead was not injured.
The accident happened on highway 8 from Himanga a few kilometres to Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help to develop cancer treatments that are more effective than before.
The findings of Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska's research team show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases the cancer's malignancy.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to match normal soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer treatments may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells.
The results of the study have been published on 4 August in the prestigious journal Nature Communications in the field of cellular biology.
Muhos family home killing continues at court, the prosecutor demands a murder sentence also for another person
Muhos' family home killing continues at court for both sentenced persons.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for a family home killing in Muhos.
One of them received 8 years for, for example, killing and aggravated robbery as a young person.
The sentence of another is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The sentenced person was also sentenced for gross endangerment of road safety as a young person and for driving a vehicle without a right as a young person.
The District Court's verdict was appealed by the prosecutor, the plaintiffs and the man who received the harsher sentence.
The prosecutor demands a lesser sentence for a young person's murder to be sentenced to 12 years in prison.
They were in full understanding at the time of the act
According to District Court, 17-year-old young men killed a man who worked as a child welfare supervisor in a schoolhouse in July last year.
According to the grounds for the sentence, a 17-year-old sentenced to murder attacked a director sitting from behind on the sofa in the living room.
The director had let go of the grip and led the young person to his room, when one of the young people hit him with a vacuum cleaner tube.
The director was also strangled with leadership, hit and kicked in the head.
According to a state of mind study, both sentenced persons were fully understood at the time of the act.
According to the court, young people had planned an escape from the family home, at least since the previous day.
Ice shark is the longest-lived vertebrate in the world, increasing only at 156
The longest living vertebrate in the world has been confirmed by an ice shark, a study published in Science magazine.
In the northern Atlantic, such as Greenland, an ice shark, or Holker, can live to be up to 400 years old.
The female does not grow until the age of 156.
The ice shark's life span is increased by the fact that it grows only one centimetre a year.
Only one species of clam is known to live longer than ice sharks.
The researchers discovered the age with radiocarbon dating.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks contained radioactive residues.
Based on these, researchers were able to estimate the shark's age.
The elder's age was estimated to be 392 years - though the throwing in one direction or another could be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as a wise economy - Kansan Uutiset
Donald Trump's America doesn't need the rest of the world.
As much as a third of the state's total tax revenue would not be paid if Donald Trump's move to corporate tax was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, especially with tax breaks that benefit the richest.
Trump described his tax programme as revolutionary when presenting it in Detroit on Monday.
The company tax would fall from 35 per cent to 15 per cent.
There would be a huge amount left uncollected, $1,000 billion a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39.6%, 33 after Trump's discount.
The inheritance tax would be abolished altogether.
Trump blamed the state for over-regulation of the economy and for bankrupting small businesses.
The agreed environmental standards of haste must be re-established and energy regulation must be dismantled.
Barack Obama's healthcare reform needs to be re-examined.
We need to appoint "experts instead of bureaucrats" to the administration.
According to Trump, the "stupid" trade policy is one of the main causes of the problems in the United States.
Free trade agreements would be suspended.
A 45 per cent penalty tax and 35 per cent penalty tax would be imposed on imports from China.
We offer a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our creed, Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need the rest of the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes will unite cities, American ships will control the seas, American steel will lift new skyscrapers across the country.
Unlike his habits, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by the assistants, even though it was interrupted 14 times by well-organised protests.
Economists - including those close to Republicans - see Trump's programme lead the United States to a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own programme early on Friday, Finnish time.
Attack wave from the past - Kansan Uutiset
The sea is frantic, but a real tidal wave strikes in the middle of Madrid's street chatter - reckoning with the past can begin.
That sums up the essence of Pedro Almodóvar's new story.
Almodovar's previous steering work The Travel Lovers (2013) was a fun little satirical comedy, followed by Iho, where I live at the top of a Spanish career (2011).
Julieta (2016) is placed somewhere between the two works.
It is a conventionally serene love, relationship and family drama centred on a mother-daughter relationship.
The story is simple and is widely seen as a long flashback.
Life seems to be good for a middle-aged name character (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a random encounter, a new man friend (Dario Grandinetti) will be amazed until the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta times the stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
He begins with the time before his daughter was born, the moments when he met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, comes to the second leading woman, who is a TV star from The Time Between Snacks (2013-2014).
Julieta's aging has been handled in a way that can be considered a slob, but I would say it's time for a quick and verbal wipe.
Often the Almodóvar films have a fair distance from such a characteristic flashyness, up to the level of humor, in Julieta.
It is a flatly played, discreet, place with good music in some places, and a rather sad film that has the ingredients for elephantism.
Instead, the visual saturation that is typical for the Spanish director is still in place and so that it slowly begins to stick in the eye more as a pure technicality than as a functional dramatic effect.
The film's characters are affected by illness, death or other sudden losses, but the surface remains as fine.
This is especially true for dressing: in the case of a name person, the costumes change from one scene to another, and the same applies to spectacular earrings.
Almodóvar is accurate in these matters, but the main thing, the tunes of the scene, is not getting any better.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and slightly breathless.
Almodóvar has produced the manuscript based on three novels by Canadian Alice Munro, awarded with the Nobel Prize in 2013.
Novellit has been published in Karkulainen: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, and the result is a bit evenly written literary filming.
The ingredients would have been emotionally unmatched even with a much bigger drama, so much big things - especially gnawing guilt - are dealt with in the film's theology.
Directory and script: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three novels by Alice Munro.
lead: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The premiere of the film is 12.8.
The government is trying an election trick - Kansan Uutiset
There will be no new cuts, saying ministers, so that the Finns don't collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring will be done a lot.
There will be no new cuts.
The already decided savings of $4 billion are enough.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (cooked) say under the budget line.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM's proposal, because the cuts in social security were decided already in the spring's frame room.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits tied to the national pension index are cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment benefit will be reduced from 500 days to 400 days.
Training cuts continue.
Municipal elections haunt
Why are ministers so emphatic about the fact that there will be no new cuts on top of them?
Because next year is an election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and are the most important thermometer of the parliamentary term, not the polls.
It has been seen before that the municipal election result that takes government parties in different directions will spoil the government's atmosphere for a long time.
However, Gallup reports that the government party's base Finns expect a snout, even though the result of its previous elections was modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary election.
The Finns Party received 752 new delegates four years ago, most of which will be realised next spring in the right-wing government.
The lifeline of the government of the three roughly equal parties depends on the basic Finns' courage.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of the party's voters had enough of government politics already during the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's visitation have also surfaced.
First of all, the "no new cuts" rhetoric obscures the fact that next year they will be done violently and the second is trying to soften the attack waiting for the Finns.
Major cuts in 2018?
In a year, everything will probably be different - if Sipilä's government is still standing.
The government has set itself the goal of indebtedness in this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo's budget proposal will take 5.9 billion euros next year, more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government will not be able to follow its own programme: the debt will not be broken or even slowed down.
The other is to stick to the program.
It means new even harder cuts on the old ones in the 2017 budget line.
The budget would be pushed at least close to balance during 2018 and then in the spring the parliamentary elections will accept what will happen.
These measures will not break indebtedness
It is quite clear that the current measures will not break the debt, even though Juha Sipilä is trying to stir up a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäki at the press conference of the budget prove it irrefutablely:
World economy growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. there will be no leverage from the international economy.
Finland's national economy has hardly risen since the collapse in 2008, except temporarily during its recovery policy in the beginning of the 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent in this decade and has been prolonged from an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs €3 billion more a year than in 2008.
With the curves presented by Hetemäki, the government debt that exceeded the 60 per cent limit in 2014 will rise to 70 per cent in the middle of next decade.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment costs about six billion euros, which is practically fully covered by new debt.
This is the understanding of the centre, the National Coalition Party and the Finns Party about what is responsible.
Poll: Many tasks are left to municipalities
Three out of four think it is the municipality's responsibility to organise child day care, youth work and exercise, according to a study by KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people also pass on responsibility to the individual municipality for libraries, culture, adult education centres, building supervision, upper secondary school education and waste management.
The region's most obvious responsibility is regional planning, special health care, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for the mentally disabled.
There is no desire to transfer any of the tasks under the responsibility of the municipalities to the state.
A minor drunk driver ran away from a police officer at the end of the chase
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu ran away from a police patrol in Ilomantsintie on Friday night around 5:30.
The police patrol tried to stop the motorbike without lights, but the young man ran away from the police at a fair speed.
The chase continued to Sonakajanrannantie, from which the motorbike continued to Sorronahontie and to a smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but a police officer with a faster leg ran to catch the fugitive.
The breath test for the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a driver's licence that would justify driving a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, for example, as a gross endangerment of road safety.
A truck with a load of rocks fell into a ditch
A truck in a rock load fell into a ditch in Polvijärvi on Kaavintie on Thursday evening at 9:15 pm.
The truck had drifted to the left in a curved bend out of the road and fell on its side into a ditch.
The rescue department lifted the injured driver out of the crashed truck through the door above, together with rescue helicopter personnel and paramedics.
Lifting the vehicle was left to the car's owner.
Hydraulic oil was drained from the crashed truck, which was sucked into peat by the rescue department.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
The elderly woman disappeared this afternoon in Ilmajoki
The 87-year-old woman has been missing since afternoon in Ilmajoki Lahtinkylä in South Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for a tall, slim and well-rounded woman with white hair that extends under her jaw.
Observations and clues about lost movements are asked to call the hotline of the Ostrobothnia Situation Centre 0295440513.
The ingredients of a major accident in the air - look at the destruction of the photo gallery Parafest
The crash flow that knocked down the tents of Parafest festival caused massive destruction.
The chairman of the Joensuu Parafest association, Arto Pippuri, estimates that the festival will get on its feet financially, and the event can also be organised next year.
Parafest's last performer Kalle Salonen performed in the market at the end of Friday evening.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with performances in the city theatre premises starting at 1 pm.
There is a Parafest exhibition at the art centre Ahjo from 1 pm to 3 pm.
The programme will be organised as planned.
The crash flow is generated in a thunderstorm when rainwater and its weight trigger the descending air flow.
The changes in the shape of the water in the thunder cloud bind the heat, and thus the falling air mass cools and its speed towards the earth accelerates.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that there are several surges in Finland during the summer.
It is difficult to predict the route of the downflows.
The crash flow hit Parafest's back yard at the Joensuu Art Museum on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents fell down, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
Four people were slightly injured in the accident.
Among them was one child, who was slightly injured in further treatment.
Air pollution ages Londoners
According to the study, Londoners' skin ages faster than usual.
The reason for skin aging is air pollution.
The British study is reported by Evening Standard.
British skin care company Caci analysed London's most toxic particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired Londoners is two-and-a-half years older than, say, a fellow who lives in rural areas.
The skin-ageing particulates are a very fine dust pollution that comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to Evening Standard, die almost 9,500 Londoners every year.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac's study found that early aging is a risk, especially for Londoners who walk on their commute near crowded streets.
The residents of London may try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example with different masks, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
The tractor's brakes failed - pushed the man standing in front
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
After he got off the tractor and went in front of it, the tractor's brakes failed and the tractor ran over him.
The man wasn't under it, but the tractor was able to push the man enough to be transported to the central hospital with serious injuries to further investigation.
The tractor did not run any further, because it hit the rocks in the front.
Riento with renewed strength for the coming season
Liiga-Riento, who plays in the Volleyball Championship, starts from better starting points in October than in memory.
The team has been together for almost three weeks.
The common note is found with certainty better than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been gloomy for Rienno.
Jani Säisä, who continues as Rienno's head coach, praises the new team for being enterprising and united.
From the foreign trio, middle fighter Fred Musoni begins his second season in Rienno.
The new face is Murangwa Nelson, aged 23, and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who played in Rwanda's national team, is a 205-inch chipper.
Garchet is correspondingly a passer, a Brazilian with a length of 198 cents.
Through Josba, Kataja and River Boys to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has been playing in almost all of the gym band's World Championships since 2003.
Now Tampere is already in the sixth race, only 2013 was missed after Canada was better at North America's qualifiers.
I worked in Turku and played with women there when I noticed the ad.
The USA was setting up a national team for the gym band.
I got interested, and here we are, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York in the city of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was a year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen was admitted to Joensuu University to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, the sport was not yet played at the SM level like a gym bandy.
The ball was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in Jokipoji in the Finnish Championship series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played the gym band SM series in the university's company during the 1991-92 season, the next three seasons were spent in Josba.
In addition to playing, he coached the club's A-girls to the championship.
Women's Finnish Championship career culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played in women's SM series for 10 seasons, the balance in 169 matches was 51+34=85.
The latest SM season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen were appointed to the national team
Perttu Puska and Enoian-based Tatu Väänänen were elected to the Finnish national team to play in the Czech Brno EFT tournament from 6 to 8 November.
The 25-year-old Perttu Puska, who attacks in Helsinki, has played six men's land matches before this, in which he has accumulated a total of 9+4=13 power points.
The 32-year-old champion of Swiss Wiler-Ersigen, Tatu Väänänen, has recovered from the thigh problem and is part of the national team's standard equipment with 117 national matches experience.
In the national team, Mika Kohonen, who was last seen in Finland's shirt at last December's World Championship, was also named as a senior player for the brothers in Seinäjoki.
Petri Kettunen, from Kontiolahti, is the main coach for the Salibandy national team.
Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM gold missing from the prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is closing as a beach volley player, at least temporarily after the current season.
Beach volley's Finnish championships will be decided at Kouvola Sports Park this weekend.
During three days, the medals are played in a series of both adults and young people.
In cooperation with Kouvola's Volleyball players and the Finnish Volleyball Association, the Finnish Championship finals will qualify for the top six pairs of the rankings in each series.
The local color in the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, who has been a member of the Finnish beach volley for several years.
Hasu, who now lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to playing in front of a familiar audience.
Hopefully, as many as possible will be able to make it to the stands this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena at the baseball stadium.
I haven't played in adult leagues very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in finals in the neighborhood," Hasu says.
The Kouvola region set fire to Hasu's spark in sport and gave a good lunch for a great hobby.
There are good memories of childhood in mind.
I started volleyball when I was 9 years old at Elimäki's NMKY girls' E-girls.
The top part is too big a jersey, knee pads spinning around the ankles and huge aces and choreographies after the point, says Hasu.
In a small town, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
Everyone's families were strongly involved - the teammate's father coached us and our mother was the club's chairman for a long time.
Essi Hasuille beach volley was already a natural choice for indoor volleyball in junior days.
The beach of Kärälammi has been playing a bit since the 1990s.
The activity has always been active in the visitors.
I also went to see the Junior Championships sectionals myself, thinking that one day I would be there to play.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu, along with Annina Parkkinen, who is a beater, will play in the finals of the SM.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked duo in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We still lack the SM gold in the trophy cabinet, Hasu throws mysteriously.
The weekend's performance in Kouvola may be the last for Hasu in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges await civilian work.
Yes, the international career will be over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, at least temporarily, the toe slippers will be put on the nail, Hasu is planning.
The crash flow knocked over tents at a disabled event in Joensuu, the disaster was near
The crash flow knocked down three tents at the Parafest festival of disabled people in Joensuu.

There was a show going on in one bigger tent.
Two tents were smaller.
The accident happened on Friday at 5 p.m.
Karjalainen's on-call fire master Markus Viitaniemi tells the newspaper that the situation had the ingredients for the disaster.
According to the newspaper, the continuation of the event is at stake.

Solomon's Koli bravely became an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as an entrepreneur means taking risks, sweat and energy.
A young farmer, Solomon's Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future also in rural areas.
Soon two years ago, Koli, together with his younger brother Valtteri Koli, began to continue their home farm.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers through his own experience.
Starting out as a rural entrepreneur meant borrowing debt and increasing the size of the farm, so that the bread could come from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always been happy with the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur myself, I've put everything in the game.
If you start something, I think it should be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we set out to build a garden barn, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
But I was really brave enough to go along with the project, and I have been fully involved in it, says Solomon Koli, adding that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in producing pure Finnish food and that everything will turn out well.
The goal of Salomon Koli, who grows meat cattle, is to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has produced results, since Solomon's Koli has been selected as the top ten in the competition of the young food producer of rural future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible victory.
He can be voted on the newspaper's website until August 21st.
Bulgaria reports inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest reading in years (since June 2012) and the first reading above zero since October last year, when a positive 0.2% was reported.
Annual average inflation, measured by the cost-of-living index, was -0.8% in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016), compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The cost-of-living index for July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. the monthly inflation rate was 1.0%.
From the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) inflation rate has been -0.2%, and annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, the price of the following consumer goods increased: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household supplies and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat's "anime" effect is judged to be Asian caricature
Snapchat said the anime has been a source of inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it is racist.
With its lens tool Snapchat enables about 150 million daily users to shape reality and play with identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character that fits Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lens are simple, facial-sharp tools that produce over 30 million improved selfies a day.
All false steps quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat's lenses have previously been criticised for promoting a blackface mask or favouring bleached skin color as a beauty ideal.
So when Snapchat was advertising a lens to some users this week that gave them slanted eyes, slanted teeth and chubby cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - "yellow face" or yellowface.
And they wondered if these repeated polemics could be a sign of the company's greater problem of diversity.
News and disapproval spread widely on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day later Snapchat said he had abolished the feature.
The company offered an explanation: Lens was meant as a tribute to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asians.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others fiercely denied anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely distributed, said in her e-mail that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable."
He added that "it's hard to argue against a comparison of the grossest Asian caricature and the effects of the filter side by side."
It shows that the filter is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face taken to extreme demeaning.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural trip lines.
American culture seems to be tied up in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and equipment that we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat's huge audience of young people, more racially diverse than their parents, may mean that they are even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
In an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates an offensive image of the user, "it's much harder for these guys to be discreet."
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to remove his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his essay to Medium and in a phone interview, he said he believed that racial disputes reflected the lack of diversity in Snapchat's pay practices.
Zhu criticised the company's mainly white male leadership and ended his writing with hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#Remove Snapchat)
"They either don't have diverse skin color representation on their staff, which is why they are able to make decisions like this," Zhu, a Chinese-American, said, "or they have different skin color representatives at work, but they're not in positions where they feel safe or can speak directly."
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint to which Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff, pointing out its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial background of his staff, but the representative said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and to push forward internal inclusion efforts.
For their part, Zhu said to keep his Snapchat account closed, adding: "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to say this is not OK."
Congressional panel said military officials distorted Isis intelligence
In a Thursday's report, the Congressional Panel said the authorities from the military headquarters edited intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than the events on the ground justified.
The interim report of a working group set up by the Republican chairman of the House's Defence Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defence Appropriations Sub-Committee found "widespread discontent" among intelligence analysts at headquarters who said the superiors tampered with their estimates of American attempts to defeat Isis.
The headquarters, known as Centcom, is the military military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The results of intelligence approved by senior Centcom leaders typically gave a more positive picture of U.S. anti-terrorism efforts than justified by the facts on the ground, which were normally more positive than the analyses produced by other intelligence community agents," the press release said.
"Centcom's events are unacceptable - our fighters in the war suffer when bad analyses are presented to high-ranking decision-makers," said Representative Ken Calvert, a California Republican.
Centcom's management's failures reach right to the top of the organisation.
The ten-page report describes in detail the constant problems in the headquarter descriptions and analyses of US efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
Even though it does not provide clear evidence that the Obama administration's high-ranking government officials have ordered reports to be tampered with, it describes analysts as feeling like Centcom leaders put pressure on them to describe in a more positive light the threat posed by Islamic State ISIS.
"In the first half of 2015, many of the headquarters's press releases, statements and testimonies to Congress were much more positive than the events themselves," the report said.
For example, Centcom's authority publicly stated that a major attack to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, is still in the hands of Isis.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear," said Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest intelligence leaders at the U.S. military military headquarters manipulated the intelligence output of the headquarters to underplay the threat of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans created a task force after hearing that analysts had raised concerns about the manipulation of intelligence about the Islamic state.
The report published on Thursday will be followed by more extensive results while the investigation is ongoing.
The Chief Inspector-General of the Ministry of Defense has started an extra ongoing investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, Democratic members of the House's intelligence committee published their own findings that were in line with some of the conclusions of the Republican working group.
"From 2014 to 2015, Centcom created an overly isolated process of intelligence assessment between ISIS and Iraqi security forces," said representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee's leading democrat, in a statement.
According to Schiff, this process "prolonged the publication of intelligence outputs", made the mood worse among analysts, and "did not give enough room for different perspectives."
Schiff and Democrats said they couldn't find any evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to match their conclusions to "preset or political narrative."
The Daily Beast reported on the preliminary results of the congressional investigation on Tuesday.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon chief inspector general has begun an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense will not comment on the congressional report as long as the inspector general's investigation is ongoing.
But he said "the experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential issues of national security."
The investigation has other consequences than the question of whether the US-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria are successful (as the increasing number of defence officials now claim).
Last year's accusations questioned how much President Obama can rely on headquarters to deliver honest assessments of the military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of Islamic state intelligence reflects a dispute over a decade ago when Centcom's intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research article saying that despite protests from several analysts, President George W. Bush's administration supported a small military force in Iraq and spent very little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion about Islamic state intelligence.
Last year, according to the authorities, Hooker's group concluded that despite the opposite public statements, the air strikes against Islamic state-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's economy because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil through the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery was not reported outside the headquarters.
The Centcom commander at that time, General Lloyd J. Austin III, began to be criticised last year after many legislators considered his testimony to the Senate to be an over-positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins for the fourth time in a row in women's field hockey, organising a showdown with Britain
The day after the team scored three goals in Japan 6-1, Katie Bam scored the first two goals in the U.S. women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans won India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sound like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he wasn't sure if he had done the same thing before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps track of their goals."
But he knows: Americans are in the 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and they share their group's first place with Britain, who was still unbeatable after winning Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have made it to the quarterfinals, and this game will decide who will be first and who will be second in their team of six.
First-placed to avoid a strong Holland, the leader of the second group, a little longer when the quarter finals begin.
Whatever the end of Saturday's game, the Americans have sparked a stir with their surprising success here, four years after they left the last 12 teams in the London Olympics.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in the Pennsylvania Blue Bell and picked up a field hockey bat for the first time at the age of three (his older twin sisters played the sport in Drexel) in connection with the national team at the age of 16, when he became the youngest player ever.
He wasn't in the 2008 Olympics because he couldn't get on the final player list.
In 2012, nothing went well for him and his teammates.
The following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed as a coach, and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We did not have the same pace of work in London as we do now.
We've turned around.
On Thursday night, Bam started the first half-time goal with a knuckle close to the goal.
India had come to the game with one victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took over.
For a long time, he carried the ball to the left side of the field, then swerved to the center and pulled the ball to the finish line, leading the Americans to a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth round.
This zero game was the first U.S. goaltender Jackie Briggs in the tournament, who had given one goal in each of the first three wins.
He's in a good mood.
So is Bam.
"We have a good situation now," Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
The peace of the trampoline in the centre of the Olympic frenzy
Wherever you are, whatever the time is, the Olympics are on.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be a constant and inevitable, furious message of competition and effort.
It's like the Olympic torch itself is a flaming baton passed from archer to swimmer and gymnast to triathlonist.
It is impossible to turn on television, read a newspaper, or listen to a neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the anger between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first time in the Olympics and the future heartbreaker with the smile pits, could well be one of the names everyone knows that are presented in their best time, supported by sponsorship agreements and TV ads - if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28 from Lake Forest, California, competes for Olympic gold in the trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all species as much.
Further away from the center, partly in the shadow, are those species that are not generally accepted by everyone: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We always have a breast swim, long live it.
But if I could make a moderate number of my special favorites, I would like to draw attention to the low-key charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it made its first appearance at the Sydney Games, there are so few observations about its presence in the past 16 years that many I interviewed didn't realize it was an Olympic sport at all.
This can be regional ignorance.
Even though the United States has sent athletes to compete in the sport, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete did not make it to the finals until 2012.
The Chinese and the Russians usually share the medals of men, Chinese and Canadian women.
This year Dong Dong of China and Rosie McLennan of Canada defend their gold medals in London.
However, trampoline has a certain underdog charm, partly because it sounds more suited to clown school than to the Olympics.
Here I have to admit that I'm not an expert, I'm just an incapacitated fan.
There are possibilities for amusement, as you can see from the vibrations of the endless bounces of cartoon films, but it also has the sweetness of gymnastics and swim jumping, the two types that it basically combines.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means a stepping board.
The champions jump up to nearly 30 feet high with a giant trampoline and have to perform rolling movements (turns, folds, and flips) and finally land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they will be judged on the basis of implementation, difficulty and "flight time."
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 countries compete, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction of the Olympics is straight ahead.
Those hoping for the medal must go further, faster, up and over - sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth around the field.
They are hunting not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in televised news, another grotesque line: the world record or the Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable and even fanatical - and it can even make the viewer cry.
But that's also why watching the games can be a bit exhausting.
Trampoline offers a break from this.
The trampoline's heading up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The competitor rises to a new climb, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Of course, there is no lack of competition or difficulty, but during the programme there is no frantic rush to the end, no leaps to the distance, just a dreamy, smooth break of time and gravity.
It is as close to Zen space as what can be achieved in the Olympics.
Women's qualifying competitions and then the finals will be on Friday afternoon when the broadcast starts at 1 pm (ET), men's competitions will also be on Saturday at 1 pm.
NBC will send the finals as part of its afternoon software starting at 2:00 on both days.
In the middle of the Olympic drug, they offer a quiet, attractive moment that most likely will not be noticed in general chaos.
And if awareness is achieved only by offering male athletes to be stared at and objectified (as recently proposed by U.S. male gymnasts according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his sighing new fan base.
"The generation is protesting" in Ethiopia, a long-standing ally of the USA
Violent demonstrations in Ethiopia
The protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters have been shot to death in clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking?
Over the last decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable states, a strong ally of the West, with a fast-growing economy.
In recent months, however, protests against the government have shaken the country as they spread to more and more areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed to the streets demanding a fundamental political change.
According to human rights groups, the government's response was ruthless.
Witnesses said the police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
Dispersed, demonstration-recorded videos, believed to be at the end of last year or from the beginning of this year, show how security officials beat young people with sticks while they were forced to stand up against the wall with their hands.
The United Nations Chief Human Rights Officer is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It was always difficult to keep this country together, and it will be even more difficult in the future," Rashid Abdi said, who is the project manager for the Horn of Africa in the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and the West appreciates its stability.
American military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives that much help from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved extremely much, and there is even a new commuter train in Addis Ababa, the capital.
The city's streets are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy, human rights organisations have been constantly talking about government oppression, the opposition in the country has been limited and dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been exiled, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But this may be changing.
"If you choke people and they have no choice but to protest, that's what will happen," said Seyoum Teshome, a university teacher from Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth is protesting.
One generation is protesting.
The complaints are diverse and cover all the power of the coalition that dominates the land use to strangle.
After the much criticised elections last year, the ruling party and its allies got the last seat held by the opposition, and now it holds all the seats in Parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border with Eritrea are increasing, and the battle over this tight and controversial border took hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, can try to exploit the turmoil and rearm themselves.
Numerous factors explain why, after years of turmoil, bitter feelings are now exploding.
The first seems seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last few years has a large number of Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more common and the internet service has improved.
Even if the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate through network proxy servers that hide the location.
Many young Ethiopians said this was how they gathered for demonstrations.
Second, Ethiopia's two largest ethnic groups, the Oromos and Amharas, get along better.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.
For a very long time, Amharas, who come mainly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, were successful in politics and business, using oroms, many of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But this, too, is changing.
"We're on our way to organizing under one umbrella," said Oromo Director Mulatu Gemechu.
The biggest demonstrations have been in Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many amharas and Oromos think Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by the Tigre people, which account for about 6% of the population and control the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenaw.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who saw around the corners.
Analysts say he was especially qualified to observe early signs of discontent and use secret ambassadors to make opponents harmless.
"Today's administration has no such basic instinct," the conflict analyst Abdi said.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked up relatively unknown to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say the security services controlled by the tigre don't trust him.
Many fear that this could lead to increased bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia was in such turmoil in 2005, when thousands of protested about the elections, which analysts said seemed to have been taken by the government first, and then robbed.
Many protesters died, albeit less than in the last few months, in the ensuing attack, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their remarkable progress in the fight against poverty.
But clearly this has not stopped the growing contempt for the Ethiopian government within the country.
And now it begins to take a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month protesters in Amhara city Gondari attacked companies owned by tigres, and anti-tigre hatred becomes increasingly common in social media.
Analysts say demonstrations put the United States and other Western allies in a clumsy position.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights to neighboring Somalia, even though it recently said it closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, they also do not want their allies in an already unstable region to collapse.
"This," Abdi said, "there is real balancing."
Donald Trump explains his Obama-based-Isisis claim to "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to suppress the dispute over his latest campaign on Friday by claiming he wasn't serious when he said several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of an Islamic state terrorist group.
The survey raised new questions about the ability of Republican presidential candidate to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also put his defenders, who have struggled to defend him during a stormy period, in a difficult position to explain the remarks he does not necessarily mean.
After the insinuation at the Wednesday night's campaign meeting, Trump argued the same with increasing enthusiasm during Thursday's interviews, where he insisted that he really meant to say that the President and Clinton created ISIS.
However, in an early Friday morning Twitter release, Trump said he was just being sarcastic.
The publication was a turnaround from the previous day when Trump said in several interviews that he was indeed serious about the accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump lighten his remark by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate took this into his hearing ears.
The latest review storm comes in a situation where Trump has tried to re-focus his campaign in the midst of the results of the polls that are counting on the economy.
Trump and Clinton fought to talk about the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the topic again.
I flee again to Twitter, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes, and he thought the speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm defense before.
Late in July, after he faced widespread criticism, apparently suggesting that the Russians should hack Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his remarks by saying "I guess I'm being sarcastic."
The approach makes it possible for Trump to visit the borders of the political speech and then return if necessary.
"I think it's a model in which he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He sees how they work and then 'clears' one way or another depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is clever about his statements and knows they are vague enough to be filtered through several lenses.
Instead of softening his speeches for a large voter audience, Trump has been even more bland in recent days as his popularity has continued to fall.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll, published on Friday, showed that Trump is following Clinton considerably in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
While Trump tends to avoid apologizing for provocative things he has said, he often accuses critics of misunderstanding his words or of misunderstanding his sense of humor.
As he faces ever closer scrutiny during the last months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have forced his loyal allies to an uncomfortable position where they must publicly support him, no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York City, who is one of Trump's most prominent supporters, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I believe there are real, political comments in his words," Giuliani said, when asked about the veracity of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded an Islamic state.
It is true in the sense that before Obama, Isis was almost an unknown, small organisation he called an amateur, completely wrong, and that is why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama government, where Clinton worked as Foreign Minister, allowed Isis to get worse because it failed effectively to deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Before the Friday meetings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued on Twitter to attack the news media that grinds his every word and are biased against him.
He mocked "bad, pathetic" television experts who try to figure him out, saying "They won't succeed!"
Some Democrats mocked Trump's excuse as new evidence that he is unfit to be president.
Previously closed coffee shop returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby, cash-accepting place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network but offered good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the street side of Bedford Avenue was too expensive for it.
The shop that replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
The locals lamented it as the latest loss in a middle-class town to be renovated.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is crushed and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is a change, it is also a reinventing.
Last November, the revived Verb opened up to Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verb has a Wi-Fi and can be paid with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and have the same unambitious atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new Verb is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old cafe, who is the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started in Verb in 2001, and was there until the end.
When a customer offered to finance him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the same.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought a similar espresso machine.
It even used the lights of old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try.
He brought new ingredients.
There are bacon-egg-cheese sandwiches on the menu, and there are capers and brown onions in the coatings.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
They don't serve beer at the cafe anymore, but they make fresh juices.
During nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
"Williamsburg was too expensive also for many former customers," he said.
One of the last Sundays, Rebecca Oliveira was one such customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited Verb regularly.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he walked to the cafe.
He says that after Verb closed down, he gave up drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized I enjoyed Verb's coffee and culture," he said.
Now he has returned to coffee, although on that day he ordered a mixed chai drink instead of his usual iced coffee, one of the new additions.
Another long-time customer, Tom Rosenthal, faithfully visited Verb from 2003.
He went there before work and always placed the same order.
"Every day 15 past seven, regular as a clock, I went in and they were making my spicy bagels with butter," he said.
Photo. Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes his usual order, but sometimes, because of variety, he orders a spicy bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn't hold a grudge against the soap shop that took over the old premises.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb, which would be used as an ingredient after the coffee shop's cold extract.
"I think we can still take the offer," Rodriguez said.
And Greenpoint's traditional Polish residents have also approved the cafe.
One of these new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Mr. Rodriguez said he was planning to put it up at some point soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice place wants to bottle and sell cold-extracted coffee.
It is possible that the cafe will expand to the next building.
For many customers, it is enough to get their old favourites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular and said he was inconsolable when the place was closed.
When a new place was opened, Whitt said he felt like he came home as he walked in and ordered a coffee.
"I had missed smelling it," he said.
A Square Meal: Depressing food from the Depression
In March 1933, soon after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to eat lunch in his office.
Rusty mouth President Roosevelt liked sophisticated Fifth Avenue dishes, such as foie liver paste, and Maryland swamp turtle soup.
That day his diet was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and for dessert, plum pudding.
"It was a sign of culinary solidarity for the people who suffered," Jane Ziegelman said.
His spouse, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
The couple in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, told about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told about life from a Lower East Side apartment house through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, released by Harper on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
By showing some kind of culinary solidarity, they meet a reporter at a dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, untraceable lunch bar in Flatiron, which has been in operation since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a serving with turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetables.
When a reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss eating the Depression.
"Musemies were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut loaf, liverloaf, beansloaf.
They were made from the ingredient and some cheap ingredient that continued the actual ingredient.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to make up your dinner.
Coe made a fuss.
"It must have felt like lead in the stomach," he said.
Years before the recession, the American tables, especially in the countryside, were like eating-so-a lot like-a-long buffet.
Women's groups cooked for male farm workers, and fresh pie was served with breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The Americans sent food to starving Europeans during World War I, and the book A Square Meal chronicles the ways in which the nation survived that it was suddenly no longer a land of abundance.
"At that time, food became a central, distressing topic for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was a new, affordable diet: Mystery dishes, such as crumbs and boxes, became the main foods, and the box was "a great way to use leftovers," said Ziegelman, because the chefs were able to hide the less attractive ingredients under the creamy sauce layer.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which had been at the center of American meals for years, became a sparing luxury product.
Special compilations were tried with calorie and nutrient content more important than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
Ziegelman prepared an early dish of fried onions to be stuffed with peanut butter while also doing research for a book containing recipes.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the dinner table," Coe said.
Ziegelman explained: "It was unreal."
Peanut butter is not in any way suitable for fried onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, the head of the Federal Household Office between 1923 and 1943, directed the country's eating habits more than ever before or since.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgeters" and to meet the challenge of turning lumps like mashed spaghetti and carrots into tasty dishes.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical treats.
Especially tasty are the reports of the government's reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's let me eat your cake attitude.
At a time when he publicly praised his childhood's simple, Iowa country food, he ate like the sophisticated millionaire he had become.
"He liked continental food like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate a tuxedo in a nearly gold-plated dining room.
He was amazingly out of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example on his own stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place that "did not just offer the worst food in Washington, but also the worst prepared food."
Many of the depressive eating habits were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, said Ziegelman, and how science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that while writing the book, they gained a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother, such as how she could not throw away the food.
"He was really afraid of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled: "He even made people sick."
There was an incident with a wind hat.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called plum foam," Ziegelman added, adding that the common trick was to give modest recipes a spectacular name.
The dessert did not contain whipped cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly sunk their spoons in a sticky brown glue.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe did it once and another time.
Sounding like a positive budgeter, he told his wife: "A bit of chopped walnuts could help."
Gilead will be paid for lawyers in the hepatitis C patent battle against Merck
The U.S. escrow judge has decreed that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to the legal fees it incurred in a dispute over a hepatitis C patient against drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from $200 million in fees after breaking two Merck patents related to Gilead's successful drugs Sovald and Harvon, following a U.S. judge's discovery of Merck's abuses, including perjury and other unethical practices.
In a ruling handed down on Thursday, U.S. engagement judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to be released from the compensation it received in opposition to the lawsuit.
Merck is trying to catch Gilead, which controls the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other for ownership of the laboratory work at the bottom of the sofosbuvir, an active substance in Gilead drugs.
U.S.-supported troops say they've taken over entirely the Manbij controlled by Isis
U.S.-supported forces have taken over the northern town of Manbij, close to the Turkish border, after the last remaining Isis fighters left the city, a representative of the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last group of fighters hiding in the city left.
The troops had released more than 2,000 civilians who were held captive by fighters from Sharfan Darwish SDF's ally, the Manbij Military Council, told Reuters.
"We are now completely in control of the city, but we have begun to study it," he told Reuters.
Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015 paid 34.2% federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published her 2015 tax return, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and his spouse's income in that year was $10.75 million, and that their real federal tax rate was 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, mainly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton made nearly $5.3 million in speech compensation, and the former Secretary of State reported receiving $3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for his book about his career in the State Department.
Clinton's vice presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia with his wife Anne Holton, published 10-year tax returns.
Their real federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3%.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
As a harsh contrast to this Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and cancels his earlier promises to release his tax returns.
According to the custom, U.S. presidential candidates publish their tax returns, even though the law does not oblige them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the IRS for an audit as a reason for refusing to publish tax returns.
"Your turn," Clinton campaign assistant Ian Sams said on Twitter when publishing a link to the Democratic candidate's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump's special assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audits are ready.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said that his refusal raises questions about his capital, his contributions to charity, his business, and many other ties to Russia, for example.
Clinton has tackled the problem by publishing an online video on Friday, highlighting prominent Republicans who urge Trump to publish his taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the issue in his economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate in recent decades has done: he published his tax return," he told the public.
Politico has announced that Trump has not paid any or very little taxes in the two years of the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants on Friday who said the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a problem in the presidential election.
Clinton has supported a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that those making over $1 million a year would pay at least 30 percent of taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At a Clinton meeting in Omaha, Nebraska last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is located there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he also has a tax office audit going on, and Trump is not "fearing" the tax office, but the voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
The real federal rate for Clintons now living in Chappaqua in New York was about 32 per cent between 2007 and 2014, and their real combined rate was about 40.5 per cent.
Clinton's 2015 tax return showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment target was an affordable index-linked investment fund, and Clinton reported $19,000 in dividend and interest income.

Chili powder condoms and firecrackers enhance Tanzania's elephant protection
Wildlife conservationists in Tanzania use an unusual method to prevent elephants from wandering into people's settlements - they throw condoms filled with chilli powder at animals.
The method has proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which invented the idea several years ago, together with the United States Nature Conservancy, has intensified its advertising by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a four-step non-violent way of protecting homes and crops without the animals being injured.
In the past, many used spears to protect themselves.
On Friday, the world's elephant day is dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since we developed the tools, we have seen a change in attitude in these communities, and they are now much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them," Honeyguide's Executive Director Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps include pointing a flashlight at an intrusive elephant and playing a horn.
If it doesn't stop the animal, throw the so-called chilli cloud.
The condom is filled with a mixture of chilli powder and soil and a firecracker, and the condom is then twisted so that only the fuse is visible.
When a condom is lit, it bursts with a bang and bursts chilli powder dust into the air.
One stroke is usually enough to send an elephant in another direction.
The last resort is the trigger that shoots a Roman candle into the air, and the fireworks produce a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: Jewish filmmaker criticized a Berlin hotel that removed Israel's area code at Arab request
A French filmmaker with Jewish background unleashed a media storm after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's area code, according to the employee, because of the "asks" of Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, who made the Shoah documentary about the Holocaust, vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in a German FAZ release.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel's hotel in the country code list.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How can it be that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been removed and wiped?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel via its own telephone centre.
While looking for an explanation, the filmmaker raised the matter at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the response from it "stranged him."
The hotel's recipeist said it was "a deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind the decision caused even more dismay in the filmmaker.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they are calling for Israel's area code to be removed," the employee said Lanzmann.
Israel's German ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman calls the case a "great injustice", Zuddeutsche Zeitung reports.
"We were horrified and shocked by the incident.
It is already a great injustice in itself.
But an even greater shame is that this happened in Germany and in this particular hotel chain.
This does not need explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident produced quite a response online when people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski hotel simply "gave in" to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Go to shame," said another publication, pointing out that the hotel on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm street is standing near the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly denied all charges and called the incident "unprecise" and "sorry" from Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
"A clear order not to include Israel in the quick-choice list was never made," Kempinski's representative said, according to Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the area code has now been added.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
The students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo, when the students gathered to protest against the government's public education system reforms.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The problems began when law enforcement tried to break up the student group, leading to police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended the demonstration to express their horror about the plans.
According to proposals by Governor Paulo Geraldo Alckmin of the state of Sao Paolo, just under 100 public schools would be closed and 300,000 pupils would be reinvested to save money.
Some of the participants in the demonstration were seen writing graffiti against interim President Michel Temer on the walls.
This latest demonstration took place only days after the protesters started as a single force to support President Dilma Rousseff, who was suspended from office while the country's Senate voted on his charges.
RT Business: Trade between Russia and Iran is suddenly growing 71%
Since the lifting of sanctions, the turnover of the Moscow-Teheran trade has increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, says Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since the removal of international sanctions against Iran, Russian companies have shown a great deal of interest in business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
"In a natural way, one of the main goals of Iran's two-way cooperation is to expand trade," Dzhagaryan said.
He pointed out that during the first five months of 2016, the net sales of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015, with a total of $856 million.
Russia's exports to Iran in particular increased by 91.5 per cent to a total of $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $158 million.
"The growth was achieved with the supply of machinery, vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year the Russian Foreign Representatives in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens mainly for travel.
Iran was also for the first time among the 20 countries most visited by tourists in Russia.
"It is safe to say that last year's record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians are visiting Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi, where monuments of ancient Persian civilization have been preserved in good condition," he said.
Scot Callum Skinner jumped to the finish line as the Brits grabbed the bike gold
Scottish Callum Skinner praised the men's team print at Rio's cycling stadium last night, when the British team's trio defended his championship from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was anchored in the role of his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy, who was proud of the young man as he scored the goal, winning the favourite victory from the New Zealand team.
Britain took the shock win four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic golds.
And they repeated the trick after modestly placing themselves in sixth March's World Championships in London, even though Hoy has since finished his racing career.
The problem between the Beijing and London Games was replacing the special broadcaster Jamie Staff.
This was done just in time when Hindes appeared.
Hoy's ending also created a vacuum that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man Britain's coaches held on to in view of the Scottish potential that has now been realised.
Hindes, Kenny - who won the championship with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner made an Olympic record in time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindes was close behind after his own round, but Kenny pushed the team to lead, and Skinner held on to it.
The change in strategy was a big part of the transformation, and included Hindes driving a bigger gear to slow down and allow Kenny and Skinner in particular to hold on to the pace.
Hoy followed his position as BBC expert and drew Skinner, Kenny and Hindes' attention as they stepped on the podium.
A 23-year-old from Glasgow, Skinner, said: "The comparison is flattering."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We made an Olympic record in the finals and won the world champions.
It was absolutely incredible.
There can be no better way to win.
After winning in London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a bad start.
He later withdrew his comments, and Britain's rivals have not complained.
This time there was no similar problem with the overwhelming victory.
Hindes said: "It felt like it was in London, when there were so many British flags on the pedestal."
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply fantastic.
One event, one gold medal for the people who won seven out of ten cycling sports in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we are expected to have a successful five days at the cycling stadium.
Based on Kenny's condition, it is not at all impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat of winning three Olympic gold at one Olympics.
That would mean that Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (that seems to be the holy day in British sports, which is also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday) - would have a total of six gold and one silver medal.
It would be the same as Hoy.
Kenny is next competing in the sprint, which starts today and lasts for three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I just enjoyed this one.
The team competition is always the best.
It will be won together with friends.
To be honest, winning alone is lonely."
Hindes said: "If he wins the other two gold medals, he should be given knighthood."
This was the only medal contest of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were among the fastest in four-man, four-kilometre team racing in the time times.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The world record that won gold in London 2012 is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will take place today, on the second day of the competition, when Wiggins will certainly be the focus of attention.
He had an argument with the judges yesterday before the appointments, when officials called him for a length measurement.
In a similar women's competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavien Katie Archibald advanced in world record time as the clock stopped at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to rely on its great track cycling team to take over the middle of the Olympics and reach a whole bunch of medals.
After performing truly exceptional and complete control in Beijing and London, expectations have been minimized before the Rio Games.
There has been drama in the background, the least of which have not been the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April because of sexism and temptation charges, and the end of the career of big people such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
Based on the first night's competitions at the cycling stadium, it seems that Britain's legendary reputation of peaking at the perfect time could be true once again.
Portland's meltless future is questionable because of cutting the electricity contract
The future of the Portland Victoria aluminium smelter, as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers, is uncertain when the power company that distributes electricity to the plant revealed that one of the plant's owners is closing the distribution contract, so it is expected that all distribution contracts will be cut.
The measure follows Victorian administration's decision earlier this year that the subsidies required to keep the plant operating will not be continued.
The aid granted for a period of 20 years ends in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs can be at risk at Alcoa Portland plant.
Up to 2,000 jobs can be at risk, directly or indirectly, with the closure of the plant.
In addition, a snowball effect can be possible, as the smelter uses about 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's smelter, which led to the closure of Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland meltdown is losing money and is under threat of closure.
The operation is now following the speculation that has been going on for several years about the future of the plant, which started as a result of a strong Australian dollar and has recently been due to the factory's production price.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminium smelter from its Loy Yang An power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it also expects the other three owners to conclude their contract.
Most of the plant is owned by Alcoa and Alumina Group, and Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
"AGL awaits the continued operation of the Portland plant, which means that the unfrozen physical electricity demand will continue," it said.
According to AGL, the contracts are so-called "protection agreements", which were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will actually end in 2017.
"That's why AGL expects the contracts to pay off in the financial year 2017," the electricity company said.
All possible results for AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by strong prospects in the futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said that it has already "in anticipation of termination" reduced the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million.
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to keep the smelting in operation or to secure the unfrozen power supply."
The US company said it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 and that it was due to enter into force in November of this year, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts have been on guard not only from Portland, Victoria, but also from the possible closure of Tomago plant near Newcastle, because of the poor economic situation in the sector.
Earlier in the week, AGL Executive Director Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity each year and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
"If both plants exit the market, it will be a significant reduction in the demand for [electricity] markets.
As a power producer, this would not be a good thing for us," he said.
Kendall, not just a Kardashian reality show star, is on the cover of September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, model 20, and the fourth daughter of Mother-Manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner's clan, is on the cover of U.S. Vogue's wanted September issue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's brand ambassador and modeled in Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news on Thursday on his Instagram account.
"Looking at this deck in a room full of people I love made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover release was followed by a peculiar (or maybe just the Kardashian style?), a handwritten reality video with the whole Kardashian-Jenner clan (excluding problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, and with everyone's favourite entertainment uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot their sister's cover, but ended in a classic twist: they were planning a surprise party.
It's a cliche plot of almost every "birthday episode" in the children's television series (Seacrest utters the lines "I guess you didn't think we'd forget you" with the credibility of the morning cartoon bunny jerk), but Krisi had to somehow get his other girls to benefit from this publicity.
This is because we have certainly moved on to the new Kardashians era with the September Vogue.
Kendall's older sister, Kim, may have reached Vogue's cover first (she shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is quite classy.
Vogue's September issue is the most selling edition of the year.
Its thickness is more like a coffee record than a fashion magazine, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion calculated that 615 of last year's 832-page opus were advertising content).
Its cover star's revelation is so expected that for the last two years the photos of the magazine have leaked before the official release.
Previous women on the cover have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have indeed been more "publics who serve as models" on the cover than "models that are celebrities."
Oscar winner and Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence were on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga's place of honour.
But if Jenner, described by the newspaper as the "surplus model" of his generation, were to hit the first category, he is in quite good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people or reality stars or young people today who know how to make a good Snapchat video (even though Jenner is all this).
They are quite rightly talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
Last year's cover model Beyonce has been one of the strongest years of her career with Lemonade's release.
Of course, not everyone is pleased with Jenner's success.
With his reality TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitches of the moment."
This feeling surfaced again with Jenner's Vogue deck.
But spinning around in discontent is irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
He is a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's makeup cream.
He and all his sisters are selling you pictures of themselves in their own apps behind the pay-per-view wall.
He's selling photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter he took for the Love magazine.
And in his spare time, possibly just to see his sister Kourtney and her children, he is a reality TV star.
Community legal centres turn away 160,000 people each year
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable people are turned away from the Community legal centres each year as the sector prepares for the impact of further cuts in funding on its already extreme operations.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no chance of fighting unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away as they seek free legal advice and representation.
The legal services already stretched to the limits of the Community are preparing for further cuts.
In June next year, these legal centres are due to lose 30 percent of their federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Community Legal Centres, said that the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres report said thousands of people are already being turned away annually.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not reversed, the situation will only get worse.
"Queensland community legal centres are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are turned away each year from the essential services they need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships with uncontrolled and crippling debts, separated families, unfairly separated workers - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows they are not getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent in June 2017, meaning thousands of vulnerable Queensland residents will be forced to navigate in the midst of complex legal problems without help.
We call on both the Attorney General and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately cancel these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the state government made a promise to raise the funding of legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the community legal centre and their customer communities, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was sued after the employee was alleged with a gun.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly not doing anything after they were told that the North Carolina head of the campaign had gunned down the employee in February while driving in the Jeep.
The incident was described in an appeal filed by former state campaign software intern Vincent Bordin in Charlotte, state court on Wednesday.
Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be dealt with internally before he realized "it wouldn't happen."
Chief Earl Phillip "put out a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger and shoved a barrel against Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign administration, Bordini heard that at least four other people had had the same experience with Phillip, said in the complaint.
"You don't have to fire guns to cause damage," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The challenge comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused anger when he told the public in North Carolina that "second-up people" - usually understood by gun owners and gun enthusiasts - could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and allowed to choose judges.
Trump's campaign said the media has taken his words out of context and that he is not in favour of violence.
In Bord's challenge, compensation is sought from the campaign for careless supervision and from Phillip for violence, assault and emotional shock.
Trump's representative Hope Hicks did not reply to the comment request immediately.
The attempts to reach Phillip did not succeed.
WCCB, a local news subsidiary in Charlote, reported that Phillip recently left the campaign.
His call to Innovative Consulting Services was not immediately answered.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign has been controversial.
The case is Bordini v Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and flourishing throughout the stomach, not just to local communities and across London.
For me, this was Heathrow's great charm, just as it was London 2012's charm, when we went to a great deal of trouble to ensure that all our peoples and regions would benefit from the games.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratford and East End.
And we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
10,000 new traineeships and 40,000 new jobs will be created for local communities alone, and youth unemployment will be eliminated around the airport.
Just as before the 2012 London Games, some come to think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the games and that we would be ashamed of ourselves in front of the world.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question that is asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and £211 billion in economic growth, leaving the legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow, who have implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment programme on time and in budget: T5, which has been voted the world's best airport terminal for five years in a row, to T2, which was built between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now the team is ready to complete the third runway, supported by £16 billion of private money.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for Britain, and I am convinced that Heathrow's expansion is also that.
It is time for us to channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, secure the future of our trade, and create a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the chairman of Heathrow Board and former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook in cat and mouse games about blocking ads
For companies that receive money from online advertising, attempts to bypass advertising-blocking software are "cat and mouse games", said one of the companies making such a programme.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad inhibitors on its computer site, Adblock Plus published a blog post that said users could update the program's filters to block ads again on the social network website.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that the code on its website will be changed around ads to make it harder for ad inhibitors to detect which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says it's circled a new code.
In a blog post, Adbuck's spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of round-off battle between the community that prevents open source ads and its spinners has been going on ever since advertising was invented," and that it is possible that Facebook will come up with its own solution soon.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has taken part in the battle is a strong indication of how much grief the ad blockers have become to industry.
Globally, about 200 million people use ad blockers, reports last year's Pagefair and Adobe study, almost quadruple the number that used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now covers 84 per cent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
However, the company is after the ad inhibitors on the computer pages, because mobile ad inhibitors do not work on Facebook's mobile apps for a social network or Instagram, the spokesman said.
Computer ads still generate enough revenue to make Facebook think that this kind of action is worth investing.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said it dailyed its ad preferences tool to give people more power about how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrying because they would also block some of the website's non-advertising content.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem," Facebook's spokesman said in an email statement.
Advertising inhibitors are boring tools, which is why we have focused instead on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
A woman was hit by a car on a Swiss motorway, apparently because of suicide
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses after a woman was hit by several vehicles on the motorway during the early hours of Thursday in a case that apparently was suicide.
The incident took place on A1 near Morges in Vaud canton just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman did a "desperational act" and lay in the dark on the road where she was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim who clearly tried to kill herself was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was hit by several vehicles, including a lorry.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the event have already been questioned, but not all have yet been identified, said the police, who appeal to them and all witnesses who witnessed the incident to report.
A criminal investigation has begun, which is a "logical" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneva.
"However, it remains to be seen whether any of the involved drivers will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
It remains for the prosecutor to decide," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years suggest that drivers are not held responsible.
In both cases - where there was a person walking on a motorway in the dark - it was estimated that motorists cannot expect to meet a pedestrian on a motorway in the middle of the night, said the newspaper.
Last year the police were released from charges of involuntary manslaughter after he hit and killed a man lying on A! near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court was told.
The court found that a police officer who was responding to an emergency call drove in a justified way, and that the man's presence on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA's new climate model estimates, Venus was probably once habitable.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to find out if Venus had ever had a hot, waterless surface and an atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and it could still have been spinning slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had areas drier than Earth, but there was once enough water and geographical variation to make life possible and protect from rapid water evaporation.
Early Venus also had the advantage of a 30 percent dimmer sun.
"In the simulation of the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus reveals it to the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of cloud that acts as an umbrella to protect the surface largely from the sun's heat.
As a result, the average temperatures in the climate are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth's current temperatures.
The model produced a story about Venus' development stages, similar to what planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Even though Venus was likely once habitable, it was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapors burned in ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, all that remained was a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere with deadly greenhouse gas phenomena - Venus, which we now know.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns from the job of Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday from the actions of Colorado Avalanche's coach and vice president-general of hockey affairs, saying the lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the information and mentioned that the team will start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have done my duty as vice president and head coach of Colorado Avalanche hockey affairs with enthusiasm, passion and determination," Roy, 50 years old, said in a statement.
During the summer, I have thought long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the coach's and the vice president-general's view must be fully in line with that of the organisation.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are not being met at the moment.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization, and we wish him luck in the future.
Roy was named the winner of the Jack Adams Award for the league's best coach during his first season in Avalanche in 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and the Central Division win, but Minnesota knocked down Colorado's playoffs in the first round and the team hasn't been able to make a move in the last two years.
Avalanche games in season 2015-16 ended in 39 wins, 39 losses and 4 draw, and the team lost five points to Wilde, losing the West Conference's wild card playoff spot.
Hall of Fame selected goaltender Roy won four Stanley Cups - two in both the Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue negotiations and delay the strike
The North Sea oil workers' industrial battles for pay are postponed as all the parties in the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, the leading negotiators said.
Strikes against the oilfield service company Wood Group have been arranged occasionally on North Sea drilling platforms led by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group, Unite and RMT federations can confirm that we have agreed to resume the process of resolving the current dispute," the joint statement said.
In the next few weeks, we will have several full-day meetings starting early next week, so that we can take a fresh look at the problems.
According to trade unions, their recent industrial action, which they say will be the first in more than 25 years, was an objection to possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year Wood Group cut the North Sea contractors' fees by about 9% due to negative market pressure.
The company's fee reduction follows a 10 per cent reduction in 2014 for contractors in its countries.
The company said that further cuts would give the company the necessary room to move out of the downturn in the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut thousands of people off their payrolls and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, as the company lightens its operations as a result of its giant fusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is aggravated by Britain's decision in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with federal leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes in the North Sea of the generation.
He said the North Sea was essential to the region's economy.
"We need an economy that works for many, and not just for a few, both in the North Sea and in the whole country," he said in the statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to invest in new projects in the North Sea, while the average of the previous five years has been about $7 billion.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of the stars in the Pleiades star cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete listing of the Pleiades star cluster's rotation rates.
New information helps astronomers to understand why the stars of the star cluster rotate at varying speeds, and how the rotations are related to planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star groups, we will now learn more about the relationship between the star's mass, its age and even its solar system history," said Luisa Rebull, researcher at the Pasadena Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis in the press release.
The Pleiades star group is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the group have been born about 125 million years ago, and are just about to reach adulthood.
They are now spinning at the top level.
At their peak spin rate, these growing stars are casting large amounts of star wind.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they slow down the stars.
As the star ages, its spin rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by following the appearance of identifiable starspots, such as sunspots.
The latest list of star spin rates suggests that more massive stars spin slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, the bigger ones making devils slower than the smaller ones.
"In the "balet" of the Pleiades, we see that slow bikers are usually more massive, while the fastest bikers are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Since the Pleiades star cluster is so close, it is the ideal cosmic laboratory for assessing star characteristics at rotation rates.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for the rotation of stars into theoretical models of both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, because and why stars slow down their rotation rate and so to speak, hang their 'dance shoes' on a nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of Pleiades' spin rates in three articles that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
