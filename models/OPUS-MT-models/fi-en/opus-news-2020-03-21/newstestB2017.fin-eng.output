28-year-old cook found dead in a San Francisco shopping mall
Only recently a 28-year-old cook who moved to San Francisco was found dead in a staircase at a local mall this week.
The victim's brother said he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother. "He had finally got his affairs in order."
The body found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old Sanfranciscola Frank Galicia, reports San Francisco's forensics office.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, death is being investigated as a homicide.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia told the CBC radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who used to be a chef in Boston, had found his dream job when he became chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A representative of Sons & Daughters said death was a shock to them all.
"We're a small and tight team, like a family, and we're very sorry," the representative said.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia said Frank first lived in hostels, but he had finally got his affairs in order.
"He found an apartment and had a girlfriend," Louis Galicia told the KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
"He was kind and big-hearted.
His way of being together with the family was to cook for all of us," said Louis Galicia.
"He never wanted to get in a fight with anyone.
He was a brother who went with the flow.
Despite all the wrongs in the world, he was an uncut diamond that shone every day," he said.
Anyone who knows about the incident is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department's tip number 415-575-4444.
Junior doctors on strike demand new industrial action
Representatives of British junior doctors (who in Finland are mostly specialised doctors) have appealed to their trade union and asked for permission for new industrial action in a dispute over a new contract of employment.
The Junior Medical Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Union (BMA) is requesting support from the whole government for further industrial action from early September.
According to JDC, ministers have not solved the problems with the contract.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the contract with BMA in the July vote.
58% of the members who took part in the vote rejected the agreement.
On Thursday evening, Ellen McCourt, chairman of the Junior Medical Committee, published a letter on Twitter to JDC members, saying the government "shuted up" about the issues that, according to McCourt, led to the rejection of the contract.
The letter reads: "In light of this, JDC government has voted against a whole new proposal for a contract and calls for all our concerns to be renegotiated.
In response to the government's silence, the government of JDC has today made a formal request to the government of BMA requesting permission for gradually expanding industrial action since early September."
Because of the dispute, junior doctors have already been on strike six times this year, including the first complete stoppages ever seen in the history of Britain's public health system.
Johann Malawia, director of BMA junior doctors, resigned after the vote because he did not accept the negotiated terms of contract that BMA had recommended.
Malawia told members of BMA at pre-vote meetings that the contract was good and should be approved, with 54,000 junior doctors and medical students taking part in the vote.
After the vote, health minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract will come into force and will apply to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an outside alliance?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met Tuesday to shake hands and bring to an official conclusion the eight-month word war and economic sanctions.
However, as Vladimir Putin accepted his Turkish brother in the golden hall of his palace in St. Petersburg, I got the clear impression that Ankara had a greater desire for reconciliation.
The parties did shake hands,
But Putin's smile looked thin and he didn't get much heat even on his own abstinence standard.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "good friend" Mr. Putin - five times, according to one report.
I couldn't keep track of myself.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return even better than before the crisis.
The next day a newspaper in our country wrote that Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I myself understood his enthusiasm just the opposite.
But the constant coolness about Putin showed that the Russian head hasn't forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Mr Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time of the event was furious.
Putin, in strict words, attacked Ankara and accused him of stabbing him in the back.
The insult was even greater because it came from a supposed friend.
Getting real trust back will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
The public opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media conducted a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
But suddenly it seemed that the Turks were the reason for everything.
The most serious were the allegations by top officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trading in areas dominated by ISIS in Syria.
Erdogan has strongly denied the accusations.
The official message from St. Petersburg, however, was that it is time to move forward.
After all, this meeting was only arranged to get Putin to apologize to President Erdogan.
This allowed Russia to win some kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring a truce are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost replaced last month in a failed coup.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have clearly shaken him too.
There is also an economic motive for reconciliation.
Russia's sanctions have hit Turkey hard, especially the charter flight ban, as several million Russian tourists normally travel to Turkey's coast every year.
The number has collapsed by nearly 90 percent.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly be sighing about the relief as air traffic can eventually be continued.
They put their faith in the late season rush to the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state television has predicted a fall in the price of fruit and vegetables when Turkish agricultural products are allowed to be imported again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," was written in an article in the financial newspaper Vedemost.
But the visit also had a greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West, because it thinks the West is weakly reacting to the attempted coup.
Without forgetting the old grudge about Turkey's EU accession negotiations and Putin's interference, Putin, who is eager to exploit cool intervals and break Turkey's ties to the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support for the elected authorities after the attempted coup.
This was self-evident for Moscow, which has its own deep concern about the change of power.
Thus, Russia and Turkey were able, by their summit at the prude seaside palace, to convey a picture that one analyst described as "an alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel abandoned and mistreated by the West join forces.
Despite public reconciliation, these two still have big differences.
The most significant is Syria, where Moscow has created an image of itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It says a lot that after nearly three hours of opening talks, both presidents told at a press conference that they had not dealt with the subject at all.
The Turkish President deliberately refused to answer the question about the differences between the countries, while Mr Putin emphasised them.
There is no clear consensus between countries on where they could seek consensus in Syria.
In view of the possibility of a total disaster caused by NATO member Turkey when shooting down a Russian fighting machine, it is undoubtedly better that, after months of open hostility, these two heads of state are once again even talking.
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear from customers outside Scotland
According to the RBS bank president, the bank's operations outside Scotland will be reduced to a "back office" in the future.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally linked to the bank's global goals.
The bank had to retreat when it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued.
During that time, brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsors millions of international sports, such as Six Nations rugby and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to let more national brands into the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will remain at the disposal of Scottish customers, but RBS will not be used for that.
In England and Wales, all RBS names will be changed to NatWeste, with the exception of head office and stock exchange listing.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are also other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a presentation to customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He said to BBC Scotland: "RBS is turning into an investment brand and because we are now becoming much more a bank of different brands.
Since the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our aspirations are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in its own community, and our staff works with customers under these brands."
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations rugby and has raised the profile of different brands in sports sponsorship.
"This is the right time to become a bank with different brands, because basically the question is how we can make the bank better for customers," said the bank's president.
"It would have been very derisive three years ago if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and put the brands in place.
But the work we do and the focus on customers' needs instead of our own needs have changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back again, so I think the time is right."
Frankie Dettori rode Predilection to victory in Newmarket and won his 3,000th victory
Dettori sprays champagne after winning twice in a row in Newmarket, which meant 3,000 wins for him.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th victory in the British Championship in Newmarket on Friday.
This milestone he achieved by riding his horse Predilection twice to win the same night on the track of his locality. Predilection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in racing on a level track.
Earlier, Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson have been able to do the same.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who earlier won in Ghayyar, says: "This is special.
My feelings are on the surface, because my family is also here.
I am very happy that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I ended up 30 years ago.
The event is not a big event, not a Royal Ascot, but a completely ordinary Friday night and a 20,000-person audience.
I'm relieved and feel very humble."
Dettori takes cheers with Predilection after winning
Two jockeys have reached a milestone in the obstacle race, and they are champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won over 4,300 times in his record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 wins
"Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the day, and it is no surprise that he was the one who reached this milestone, which few have achieved.
He is stylish and strong, but his tactical edge is what separates him from others.
He's a fantastic representative for racing, his enthusiasm and thinning has brought fans to the sport for years."
"I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have won 6,000 races already if he didn't only compete on weekends and only in big games!
Seriously, Frankie's riding career at the UK Games has been victorious for nearly 30 years, which has been great to follow.
He is a lively person, which is good for the British racing, but above all he is an incredible jockey."
Frankie Dettori vented his achievement in a symbolic way by flying off his horse.
Frankie Dettori has been a model of British racing for two decades now.
The journey has accommodated ups and downs.
He has won a number of big games, including his famous win at Ascot in 1996 "Magnificent Seven", but he has also survived a plane crash and has been banned because of drug abuse.
When the ban ended three years ago, he had a start-up problem, but he showed admirable strength of character, looked to his sceptics and returned to his best.
And he won't be finishing his career for a while - Dettori has recently said he wants to continue his career until at least 50 years old."
Putin dismissed Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly dismissed his chief administrator Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been a member of Putin's trusted inner circle for several years.
Mr Ivanov, 63, was now appointed special representative for the environment and transport.
According to a press release from the Kremlin, President Putin "decided to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration", but no justification was given for the dismissal.
Anton Vaino, who has been Vice President of Ivanov since 2012, was appointed to the task.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
Vaino, who was born in Tallinn in 1972, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later he led the president's protocol department and the government office, says the Kremlin's Russian-speaking website.
Vaino thanked Putin for his appointment in the following words: "I am grateful for your trust.
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your actions as head of state, which means making draft laws and monitoring how the instructions you give will be implemented."
Putin told the Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov himself had requested a resignation and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Are the smiles real?
This move has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been close to Vladimir Putin, and like Putin, he also has a KGB past.
As head of administration, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a Russian state television meeting with President Putin, they both said Ivanov would withdraw from the mission at his own request.
Despite the smiles on the cameras, few are convinced by the explanations, especially in the run-up to the parliamentary elections.
Are they the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been very suspicious of the official claim that the man praised as a possible president suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy.
The Kremlin website presents Ivanov's words to Putin, where he says: "It is true that in the beginning of 2012, I asked you to give me this very complicated and to some extent even difficult task for four years.
Now I have been President's Chief of Administration for four years and eight months."
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Before that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
When Putin was head of the Federation Security Service (FSB) that replaced the KGB in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed deputy chief of his command.
As Putin entered power, he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov might become Russian President Putin after his second term, since the constitution would have prevented Putin from being elected for his third term.
However, the mission went to Dmitri Medvedev, another close to Putin.
Putin became Prime Minister, after which he returned to office only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds - FBI researcher star Thomas Gibson was fired after hitting the producer
Gibson was involved in a violent fight at the scene in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, reported the kicks in their joint announcement.
Gibson, known as Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, had apologized on Thursday before the announcement of his dismissal.
"We had creative differences.
I'm sorry this happened," he said in his statement.
Information about how Gibson's character is written out of the series following FBI agents will be published later, reports ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Previously in the comedy series Dharma & Greg, 54-year-old Gibson has been in the series since its first production season, 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul in it for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement published on Friday.
"I hoped I'd see the end of the show, but it's no longer possible.
I want to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our great production group and the most important: the best fans the show could ever have hoped for."
The 12th season of the series will begin in the United States on September 28.
The mysterious beaching of fish in Banffian garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects that these 75 fish are wind fish that have been caught in the country as a landscape of a hurricane.
Bain, 500 metres from the seaside, released footage of the vision in Periscope, hoping to get an answer to the appearance of these five-inch fish.
Queensferry overpass is now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern deck and the land bridge of Queensferry bridge, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of the four sections between the "folders" that are now almost ready around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It contains 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 wire ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Keith Brown, the cabinet minister responsible for the economy, visited the site today and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
Brown says: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry overpass.
We are all witnessing a truly significant step forward in building the bridge, with over 30,000 concrete and steel being used to build this bridge section alone.
Despite the massive size and weight, building a bridge section between a land bridge and a bridge deck is a subtle operation that requires extremely precise installation tolerances.
Nearly 79% of the whole bridge deck is now in place, and the rest of the deck is about to get its concrete cover casting in Rosyth today, which means the deck is ready to be lifted."
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructions project, said: "The completion of the first bridge section is always a significant milestone in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this part represents the top of the road and water construction.
After the last part of the road deck was installed and connected to the North Tower road deck, we had to close the remaining gap on the north side (i.e. on the ground).
This was done by pulling a northerly land bridge 700 mm southwards.
This was a massive and, at the same time, a high-precision operation.
Massive because the bridge has a length of 222 metres and a weight of about 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up at an angle of about 3%.
And it requires great precision, because the tolerances that the team had to follow were very small - just a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went well."
Moelfre Bay Rescue Department tells of the miraculous rescue of three men
Three men on board from their fishing boat in front of Anglesey were saved like a miracle.
The Marine Rescue Station of Moelfre RNLI issued an alarm on Friday at 1:20 p.m. local time after its crew discovered the accident in the Bay of Moelfre.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety while their boat continued its reckless course without a pilot.
"We saw the boat orbiting right next to them and imagined the worst," said Vince Jones, who drives the Moelfre lifeboat.
"By the time we got to the water, the strong winds had thankfully driven the boat away from them."
The local fishing boat rescued two of the men, while the third, 60 years old, was found exhausted, clinging to the buoy and without lifejacket.
They were all picked up in a coastal rescue boat and transported to a rescue station.
Vince Jones says: "It's a miracle that these three men on the water are still alive and in perfect condition.
The boat's engine had an emergency extinguishing cord, but for some reason it had been detached from the man driving the boat in the crash.
They were really lucky to be there."
Pokémon Go hunt brings health and happiness
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
During the last decade, many have complained about why teenagers and children are no longer going out to play, preferring to stay inside and stare at their screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get off the couch and move.
Originally, it was only TV viewing that took time, then video games and the latest smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and outdoor exercise are not mutually exclusive.
With this, of course, I am referring to Pokémon Go, a game app that has characters from a video game created in the 1990s (which later also made a cartoon series, cards and other side products).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, this also stopped a bit before the new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was delayed due to a huge interest that overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, Pokémon Go passed Tinder and was almost as big as Twitter.
Then how does the game work?
In brief, players go out to search for Pokémon with their smartphones, which are monitored using GPS, and when Pokémon is found, it can be "photographed" (by using a phone screen image) or "capture."
Wildness has taken on a generation of people who played video games when they were younger and lifted their butts from the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps taken by the "average person" in a day.
Washington Post recently reported on Apple Watch's Cardiogram app, which found within two days of the game launch that 30 minutes a day suddenly increased from 45 percent to 53 percent, followed by 35,000 users.
The company doesn't know which of the users is playing Pokémon Go, it only sees the raw data on the amount of exercise.
Many public health campaigns that encourage people to get off the couch and move for at least 30 minutes a day have fallen on deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertisers have looked unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Regularly moving people are less likely to develop cancer or depression.
Exercise helps with weight control, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a lot of other benefits.
The beauty of Pokémon Go is that it makes people out to do something they enjoy.
That is how it achieves three basic health-supporting things - exercise, fresh air and sun and joy.
It is even possible to make new friends during the hunt.
As usual, those in this phenomenon also resent the funniest.
And yes, someone can walk to the door while playing.
What about it?
The breakthrough has been made.
Because even though smartphone apps like Fitbit could already track your activity earlier, they did not give a reason to start, as Pokémon Go does.
The novelty will disappear, and the use will be reduced in due course.
However, with Pokémon's success, there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with activity in the real world, which will increase the physical activity of people going on a hunt and improve their condition and health.

Simone Biles grabbed gold in a women's gymnast multi-match
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
Dynamic jumps.
No trouble at the boom.
The jaws fall on the floor.
Brilliant at everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
An American 19-year-old gymnast won a multi-match championship on Thursday and increased the gap between herself and the rest of the world in the Olympic spotlight.
His total score of 62.198 was clearly better than the silver-based "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Alya Mustafina.
U.S. Simone Biles performs on the boom at the women's gymnast in the multiple-match final on Thursday in Rio's 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth in a row and the fifth ever American woman to win the multi-match championship, thus strengthening her reputation as the best of her generation or even the best of all time.
Biles burst into tears as his total final score became visible and his long journey to this moment ended.
The achievement takes the sport to completely new dimensions and raises him to the same level as other sports superstars like Michael Phelps:
Biles has been completely superior in his sport for the last three years, winning 15 World Championship medals, including 10 gold, and earning them with such ambitious and precise programs that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the greatest gymnast of all time."
In Brazil, there was still one last competition, which was between Biles and himself and the burden of overly high expectations, not so much between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Texas Spring with less than a handful of gold medals would be seen as disappointing.
U.S. Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman hug after winning gold and silver at the women's gymnast in the multi-match final on Thursday at Rio's 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles won the first gold medal on Tuesday as a point at the farewell party of Martha Karolyi, who coordinated the national team on top of the i.
Even though Biles claimed he's never thought of anything in advance when he was at the top for a long time, it's not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program, which includes a volt series known as his leverage card, has been adapted to Latin music that might well be heard on the streets outside the Rio Olympic arena.
It's not a coincidence.
Having been adopted by his grandparents as a child and found by Coach Aimee Boorman's mother has become a powerful figure, Boorman found the girl while she was on a kindergarten tour in the gymnasium where Boorman coached.
He hasn't lost a single multiple match since summer 2013, and the winning streak is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to.
Despite Mustafina's small lead with two turns, it was like mirage.
There was the boom and the permanto, where Biles is the defending champion of the world.
He was back in the lead with 15.433 points in the beam and crowned the result with 15.933 points in perm.
Raisman hugged him gently while they were waiting for the final points - a mere formality - and tears began to appear around Biles' red, white and blue glistening capping color when his dream, once written in his scrapbook, came true.
Raisman's performance was a small rematch to the competition four years ago, when he first divided the third place but then lost the bronze to Mustafina in a rerun.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, whom the Americans call the team's "Grandma" was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent kisses to the audience after his permanto program, and thus rose from defeat to victory, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
As far as Biles is concerned, this 19-year-old's earlier week's wide-spread tweeting now has a whole new meaning:
Police report that three people heard music in the car were killed by a serial killer
Two women and a 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix's most devastating massacre in ten years, while the victims were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, reports a police release published on Thursday.
According to the authorities, on June 12, Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the street.
The shooter was standing on the passenger side of the car, from which he fired eight shots with a handgun and then escaped with another car, says the press release.
Police suspect that the triple homicide was not caused by a robbery, since the attacker did not take purses and the $2,900 found in the possession of another adult victim.
Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, says the police are now investigating whether the killing is related to four earlier attacks.
A total of seven people have died and two have been wounded in nine attacks that have taken place mainly in Latin American settlements within four months.
"It is common for events to have happened in residential areas outside the homes," Howard told a CBS subsidiary to KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including the late 1990s brown Nissan, late 1990s black BMW and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Researchers do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are related and the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital because of her injuries, where she later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died immediately at the scene.
An eyewitness told the police that the trio had often sat in a car listening to music.
In addition, the police published a statement about the shooting of an empty pickup car only half an hour before the triple homicide, which is believed to be the same in both cases.
Researchers found shell casings and recovered bullet fragments from the car seat and from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old boy with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most other peers, Edmund has microcephaly, a birthright that is due to the genetic disorder of his mother Elizabeth Picciuto, who was not aware of when she was pregnant.
"When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was that I couldn't get through this.
I can't get away with this.
I didn't commit to this.
Which is not true at all - of course you are committed to it," he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognise them or survive at all.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest that the child be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that I didn't think there was any such practice at all," Picciuto said.
Edmund is walking with a walker.
Edmund didn't get up and start to crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's slowly moving at his own pace.
He walks assisted and rides a bicycle.
She likes to play with her two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth is presenting Edmund's invention of a sign that means "sing to me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not just mean ordinary sign language, it also includes signs that Edmund himself invented.
Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of diseases: hereditary, such as Edmund's, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zikavirus.
There is a great variety of symptoms and predictions.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the lives of those affected by Zikavirus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional storm caused by an uncertain future.
"I kept saying: what will happen to us,
What will happen to us?"
And he still doesn't know.
"I haven't asked for a prediction in a long time, because I don't think anyone can give it to me."
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose children have congenital defects caused by the Zika virus.
Things are getting better.
Things tend to work out.
You love your child, and your child loves you."
Heavy rains and floods caused massive rescue operations in Louisiana and Mississippi
On Friday, the governor of Louisiana declared a state of emergency due to heavy rains and widespread flooding, and more rain in the state is expected on Saturday.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers in south-eastern Louisiana and southern Mississip flooded their banks and spread to a wide area as a result of heavy rains.
Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards says that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help is already on the way to flood areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor's department for national security and emergency preparedness, reports that the agency receives requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags.
According to Steele, only Tangipahoa County has asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood warning will remain valid until Saturday in most of South Louisiana.
According to a press release from the Weather Service, there may still be 76–127 mm more water in the area.
A flood warning was issued in South Alabama on Friday, as the rain continued in the Mobile region.
During the weekend, the Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both of which in Louisiana, are predicted to rise to record heights.
According to weather forecaster Alek Krautmann, many houses along rivers can be flooded in suburbs of Baton Rouge.
He also says that the floods downstream in Ascension County pose a threat, as the flooding rivers slowly drain into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, had risen higher than ever on Friday at 9 a.m.
The rescue work continued in Amite and Wilkinson districts in Southwest-Mississipi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson, were earlier on Friday near Glolor among the rescued.
Hansford, 62, says the Beaver Creek River, which is normally more than 120 metres from his house, rose quickly during the night.
The other stepson who lived nearby had warned him.
"We got up, and water was coming with a constant pitch," Hansford said.
"It reached my waist."
The wife had told Hansford that she has never seen the river rise so high in the 48 years she has lived in the area.
Hansford says he and his family all have injuries, and he is the only one who can swim.
The rescue workers had rescued all three of them in a large military-style truck and took them to the fire station in Glolor, where they were sheltered on Friday.
Weather forecaster Krautmann says the floods are spreading rapidly as heavy rains continue, and authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He reports information from an observer near Livingston that it had rained nearly 350 mm between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says the soil was heavily wet after the rains that began on Wednesday.
Authorities say that because of heavy rains and flooding streets, people in Tangipahoa County had to be rescued from their homes and school hours had to be cancelled in five school districts.
A member of Tangipahoa City Council had told the CBS subsidiary WWL that there were 200 homes flooded.
The residents had been evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has reached both.
County leader Robby Miller says the authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets who had been trapped in the flood.
Protected places have been opened for the evacuationees in the cities of Amite and Hammond.
"They get to return to their homes when the water starts to retreat," he said.
In the city of Hammond, Tangipahoa County, nearly twenty streets had to be closed because of a flood, and residents were offered sandbags to try to stop water from entering their homes and their businesses.
"For the last time, we had a big flood in March," says Lacy Landrum, a city board member.
"This flood seems similar."
In Mississippi, the rains continued flat off the Gulf coast of Mexico, says Harrison County Rescue Director Rupert Lacy.
According to Lacy, a handful of houses under flooding were reported on Thursday, but so far no news had been received on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods, says he has lived in the Amite area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before, and more rain all the time."
A 6-year-old Mahaj Brown with multiple bullets in his body survives a shooting in Philadelphia
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, who is already the second six-year-old who has been shot in the city this week.
The child's grandparents said the boy was Mahaj Brown on CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents said the boy had multiple gunshot wounds to the groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got hit a lot, his little body was full of bullets," said his grandmother Delores Melendez to the television company.
"I can't believe this is happening."
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital and has undergone several operations.
The family will tell the television company that the boy is expected to survive.
He was starting the first grade in the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown district.
Two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man were also shot.
Another 29-year-old was reported to be critical and the other two were stable, CBS Philadelphia said.
According to the television company, the child was found next to a 29-year-old in critical condition in the front seat of the car.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are now investigating whether one of the wounded men could have been the shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia it was a crossfire between many armed men.
The scene was full of assault weapon-type shell casings from various assault weapons.
"It is quite clear that this was an ongoing battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
Several armed fighters have been present, and they have been actively involved in the shooting," Philadelphia police captain Anthony Ginaldi told the television station.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
There have been no arrests, and the police are reported to be going through surveillance videos.
Another six-year-old in town this week was a girl with a stray bullet in her hand as she played in front of her home on Tuesday in West Oak Lane.
The girl is recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is what I call the women's gymnast Olympic team, and there is more than one reason.
First of all, I have been to every summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as superior as it is now.
Secondly, this team's three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colored girls.
The team's composition, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team finally represents America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the best female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were 1 and 2.
This is great.
At the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas became the surprise winner of the games, and the whole of America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, and surprising and masterly gymnastics programs.
On Thursday Simone became the fourth consecutive American to win gold in the women's individual competition's multi-match.
Teammate Aly Raisman, on the other hand, won silver.
The views are like this at the top of the sport, but it doesn't look the same in gymnast classes across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same tracks as Aly and Madison to form an Olympic team.
They are the last five ("Final Five") because the next gymnast in the Olympic team will only have four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karolyi's last year as a coach.
The reality, however, is that gymnasts are an expensive sport, and gymnasts train mainly in private gymnasts, which are maintained by their parents, who pay for training costs, facilities, travels, costumes, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches, gymnasts and family members), etc.
Most gymnasts' facilities are located in prosperous residential areas that are able to support the operations.
The teaching of the gymnasts takes place in these clubs, and that means a costly and long-term commitment to the gymnasts' families.
Simone Biles coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez coach Maggie Haney have both trained sports enthusiasts since they started gymnast.
We need to provide a cheaper and more accessible gymnast education for the countless young girls who have been inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my own gymnast fund 20 years ago.
My organisations in Harlem have offered a free or affordable opportunity to gymnasts for more than 15,000 urban youth (mostly black and Latin Americans) and some of these young people have won national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our operations to my hometown of Detroit so that we can offer high-quality gymnasts to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Teline gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings lasting benefits for the whole life and supports good health and success in school and working life.
This team has inspired the enthusiasm of thousands of young girls who now want to start gymnasts, and that is absolutely amazing.
Participation in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the real "girl power" you showed when you won Olympic gold, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start their way into being healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal and are preparing for new strikes
Ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes in salary and working conditions by accepting a renewed contract with the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in the vote rejected the proposal.
Health Minister Hunt said in July about plans to force the contract and said Britain's public health system (NHS) was "no one's country" and that any further delay is harmful to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors move on to a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work practices to improve health care in antisocial times.
Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA junior medical committee, made a statement last night, saying: "Junior doctors are still very cautious about the proposed contract, especially the fear that it will accelerate the current labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
It is only eight weeks before the first doctors are transferred to the new contract, so now we have to move forward, because time is running out.
BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by talking, but the government has been reluctant to engage in discussions and sometimes even without reacting in any way.
I did, despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door will always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, cancel the contract and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this does not happen, junior doctors will be ready for new industrial action."
The last strike at the end of April delayed nearly 13,000 routine procedures and 100,000 reception times, when nurses and consulting doctors were asked to support strike doctors in the strike watch.
Ministers hoped to close the dispute about the changes by concluding a renewed contract with British doctors' union staff.
The trade union BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54,000 junior doctors who would be affected by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director general of NHS employees, appealed to junior doctors not to take any new strikes.
Mortimer says: "Industrial action achieves very little or nothing, but it puts pressure on teams and services already operating at the limit, causing worry, distress and disturbance to patients, nursing staff and their families.
For the last two months, we have been negotiating with the junior doctors' committee, and together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of supervisor and the revelation of the defects.
The workers were hopeful that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from career breaks, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay gap in the care sector - was a sign of how seriously workers, Health Education England, who are responsible for health education, and the Ministry of Health want to stick to agreements with BMA in November, February and May."
A medicine that pays about €2.40 a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are about to have access to a €2.40 medicine a day, when authorities recommended that it be given to more people and for longer-term use.
Anticoagulant ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The drug is already given 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) of Britain's public health system (NHS) has advised that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) has advised that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people have a heart attack every year, one-quarter of them having a heart attack or having a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty matter that builds up in the walls of blood vessels, which produces plaques.
If the plaque ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that prevents blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if a blood clot comes off, it can pass through the bloodstream and prevent blood flow to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new attack is higher in people who have had a heart attack once.
The ticagrelor produced by British AstraZeneca, sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the probability of clots.
Today's draft NICE guideline recommends that ticagrelor be given for next 90 mg for 12 months, after which the dose is reduced to 60 milligrams, and that aspirin is given twice a day for another three years.
Carole Longson, a professor at NICE, said: "Even though effective treatments to prevent disease progression and symptoms are available, as many as a quarter of those who have had a heart attack will have another attack or stroke - often with fatal consequences.
Fear of regeneration can have a very negative effect on a person's quality of life.
We have evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation to use ticagrelor temporarily increases treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it."
Due to the limited information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially with regard to the risk of bleeding, if it is used for more than three years, the draft guidance does not recommend the use of the treatment method for a longer period.
Because of a climate of political correctness, voting fraud in Muslim areas flourished
Tower Hamlets' former mayor Lutfur Rahman was dismissed from office last year for corruption, as a result of which the government reported
The climate of political correctness led to the closing of eyes from widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, reveals a government report published today.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles severely criticised the police, election observers and city councils for closing their eyes to electoral fraud "because of hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
According to Pickles, a former regional government minister and a current anti-corruption force, intimidation of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police should have had permission to set up guard chains outside polling stations to protect the frightened voters.
He suggests that voters should present an identity card in order to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At the moment, the voter should simply state his name and address.
In addition, the report suggests that the fingers should be dipped in indelible ink after voting, so that no one could vote twice.
The whistleblowers should be protected more, says Sir Eric.
He calls for better access for journalists to government documents and decisions by informal committees and working groups.
"The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to combat corruption and fraud against financial interests and a culture that favours them more widely in local governments," he said.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report after the vote scandal in Tower Hamlet in East London.
Last year, a special election court ordered that then Mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office because of corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman "distorted" the religious sentiment of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and anti-Islamicism.
Rahman was said "to base his campaign on the fact that every religious Muslim had a religious duty to vote for him."
As many as 300 of the votes were questionable or fraudulently given in a way that a person voted by pretending to be another person.
According to Sir Eric, evidence of fraud was found throughout the country.
He expressed his particular concern about postal fraud, where high-ranking members of the Muslim community were said to have pressured people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric (in the picture) made a number of suggestions to clean up the voting system, including requiring an identity card at the polling station.
The report says: "There is evidence that some vulnerable members of ethnic minority groups, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote according to the will of older members, especially in communities from Pakistan and Bangladesh."
"We were concerned that... state institutions had closed their eyes to such activities because of "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the system, including banning political activists from handling postal ballots, in order to prevent 'voice harvesting'.
The report currently under consideration by Theresa May also calls for stricter checks on registration to prevent the use of the voting register for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consideration of options requiring voters to present identity cards before voting.
Baptism of fingers into indelibly ink after voting, so that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure voters' nationality and voting rights.
Setting a three-year limit for requests for an automatic postal vote.
Ban political activists from handling filled-in mail votes and letter envelopes.
For police, the right to set up guard chains around polling stations.
Changing the law to make it easier to prosecute intimidation under the 1983 Representation of the People Act on the extension of voting rights.
Prohibition of photography at polling stations.
Only to allow English at polling stations (except Wales).
Improving training to ensure staff monitor the rule that only one person at a time can go to the polling booth.
Sir Eric harshly criticises the London police and finds it "unsurprising" that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlet incident.
"The election court dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his representative from his post because of corruption and numerous illegal practices," he said.
"He was found guilty without reasonable doubt and the criminal evidence threshold was exceeded on a number of grounds."
He also criticised the inefficient "ticking checks" by the city council's electoral lists departments.
"Last year's ruling by the court in Tower Hamlet was a wake-up call," said Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of its legacy as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by worrying and covert electoral fraud by some people and its denial."
The Olympic cyclist's resemblance with Duchess Catherine and the other doppelgangers are going wild at the Rio Olympics
The fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics went wild this week from French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge is amazing.
But according to social media discussions, this 24-year-old Olympic representative is by no means the only athlete fighting for the championship who has a resemblance to a well-known person.
In honor of the Rio Games and all the well-known faces on our screens, FEMAIL compiled a list of all Olympic representatives whose resemblance to Hollywood celebrities is obvious.
Hunter and wolf: United States men's archery team Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to the duchess Catherine's doppelganger seen on the bicycle tracks, many people have quoted in social media how one archer could be the double brother of the actor favourite Leonardo DiCaprio.
The U.S. men's archery team Brady Ellison caused a storm after pictures of him published on Twitter, strikingly reminiscent of the star of Wolf of Wall Street.
Ellison was aware of the noise of social media and admitted that he had heard since he was a child that he resembled DiCaprio.
"I don't personally see the resemblance as that big, maybe apart from the beard and mustache," Brady Huffington said to Posti.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I take this as a compliment."
In the 2012 London Games, British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris were shrugged about the resemblance, which is undoubtedly even more highlighted in these games.
A big-eyed Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina has been called the double of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
On the beaches, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Matthew Morrison, known as Glee TV series, for years.
This user says Nathan Adrian is an "athletic version" of the actor in Inception.
Similarly, for a long time the resemblance between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett has been quoted, highlighted by both strong eyebrows and lips.
Uinn silver medalist Yulia Efimova from Russia resembles actress Annalynne McCord, not just because of her beautifully tan skin and blonde hair, while U.S. team Nathan Adrian, according to his fans, is an "athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt."
These two iron women, football star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter (right), resemble each other in face shapes and eyes.
Not only: this Twitter user was pleased that others also saw the resemblance.
This user wonders whether the pair's resemblance is a good reason.
A tweeter recently said he was happy that "others on the internet also agree about Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter's resemblance."
The American football star and the actor in the Dexter series are strikingly reminiscent of each other in their face shapes and eyes.
Many have also seen the resemblance with Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney smiled, and the gold-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas and Anna burn in the broad smiles of Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer "dead like a pig"
Byron MacDonalds' analysis, instead of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth, in a women's 4 x 200-metre freestyle message, shocked CBC's direct Olympic report viewers on Wednesday.
Canada's broadcaster CBC has had to apologize since one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "lost smell" and "dead like a pig" during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone had been turned off when he began to give his own opinions at the end of the women's 4 x 200-metre freestyle finale.
MacDonald, who was included in CBC's reporting team to bring color, was heard saying: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, left fast and died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second part of the message at 1:57.79, leaving 1.61 seconds of Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed the Canadians to swim in China.
The viewers across Canada reacted quickly after being shocked by the tone and language of the commentator.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC commentator just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig?????
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air."
The Chinese Ai Yanhan, who swims in the women's 4 x 200 metres freestyle message final, was described as: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter was quickly filled with furious comments about Byron MacDonald's criticisms, and many demanded his dismissal.
The tweeters did not hold back when they heard how oblivious Byron Macdonald was.
Tweeter Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like racist people.
Scott Russel, who hosted CBC's broadcast, quickly apologized for MacDonald's remarks: "We apologize for the comment about the swim performance.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we are sorry that this happened."
CBC finally had to apologize more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to a comment.
Commentator colleague Scott Russel had to apologize for MacDonald.
CBC then copied and glued its apology to a comment from more than 90 other tweeters complaining about MacDonald's speeches.
The TV company also quickly made a public apology.
"We're sincerely sorry about these statements and that they got on the air.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on last night's broadcast, and we also apologized to our social media followers.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments related to the swimmer's performance, not to him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was unfortunate, and Byron is very sorry for his words."
On Thursday night, MacDonald apologized on the air and tried to justify his speech by saying he didn't mean it personal.
"I want to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's message swim," MacDonald said in CBC's Olympic broadcast.
"I referred to the swimmer's performance, not the person.
It goes without saying that I didn't mean anything degrading by what I said, and I am very sorry."
In Primark, a woman who tried on underwear in the middle of a store shocked customers
Customers didn't know where to look when a woman undressed in the middle of Primark to try on underwear.
He further made the situation worse by assessing what he looked like in his underpants, taking them off and putting them back on the shelf.
He continued to circle and finally tried four pairs of underpants at a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
Primark chain store located at Folkestone's Bouverie Place shopping centre, where she tried underpants in front of everyone and put them back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two in the shop at the same time, said that after trying on underwear, an unknown woman dressed up and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He tells of what happened: "People couldn't believe their eyes.
The woman stood in the middle of the shop, took her underpants off the shelf, took off her own tights and underpants and put them on.
He did not try to do it discreetly, but he did it with complete shame.
Everyone was staring at him when he took the underpants he had tried off his feet, and apparently he didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf.
He did it again three more times before finally deciding he didn't like any of them, dressed up and walked out.
He didn't seem to care about the looks - and he didn't think about the person who would eventually buy the underwear he had tried on."
The 33-year-old Davidson, who lives in Kenttown, continues: "How disgusting to think someone is taking home underwear someone else has used and has not been washed."
The incident happened Tuesday afternoon.
"I have understood that the shop staff tried to remove those items from the sale after the woman had left - which is right.
It would be terrible to take the new underpants home and find that someone else has tried them without them being washed after that," adds Davidson.
Primark's spokesman commented on the matter, saying: "Primark is aware of the situation in its Folkestone store on Tuesday, August 9th.
All the products in question have been removed from the sale.'
This is how you defend yourself against an armed attack with Krav Maga
The world is full of dangers, but this video from Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed Rhon Mizrach, the Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, and asked how to deal with a robber or abuser that is within range of the gun.
The video shows how you can defend yourself against the attacker, depending on whether the attacker approaches you from the front or the back.
If the attacker approaches from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around to see the attacker and get off the firing line, says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun so that it stays between your forearm and your upper arm, and strike the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Then kick the attacker with a knee to the groin, and when he goes double in pain, slap him in the face with the barrel of a gun, and back off by keeping the gun pointed at him.
The technique is similar if an armed attacker approaches from the front; you must move away from the firing line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker cannot launch.
At the same time, place your weight on the gun and punch the attacker into the chest with a fist, turn the gun away from the attacker's grip, back off, and keep the gun pointed at the attacker.
Does that sound difficult?
Check the video to see how Mizrachi does it.
But remember that the safest way to get rid of the robber is to hand over your cash - unless you are the Krav Maga Grand Master.
World Traveler Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe
The British world traveler put his resistance and cakomist reflexes to a hard test by licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Suffolk host and travel guide writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove his resistance by licking euro banknotes, handrails on Piccadilly Circus, train flush button and Russian public telephone.
Before licking, Wright measured the objects with a luminometer to see for himself and show the viewers where he was pushing his tongue.
The experiment was turned into a documentary film Ian Wright – on the trail of inner strength, and its results surprised.
The idea of licking the train's toilet flush button can be disgusting, but in fact there are more bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On his way to different parts of Europe, Wright will interview doctors and other medical professionals to strengthen good intestinal bacteria and their own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked caused nothing more than a bad mouth.
Ian Wright was originally known for his travel program, where he tested the endurance of his intestines by travelling around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
licking rail station handrails and toilet flush button undoubtedly challenged Wright's resistance.
Wright says in the document: "I've been pretty carefree about my health since I was a kid, and I've put all kinds of things in my mouth like dirt, worms and mud water."
In the film, he really proved to be worthy of his reputation.
The border was only met in a dirty public toilet in Russia.
The luminometer measured more than 4000 units from the sample.
For comparison, the number of newly washed hands is usually less than 60.
The border was met in a Russian public toilet, where Wright refused to lick when a luminometer measured 4,000 units - in newly washed hands the same number is less than 60.
Wright adventures in a documentary Ian Wright, produced together with Valio, on the trail of inner strength, where the number of bacteria is made visible in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the document: "This is almost the worst smell I've smelled in any toilet.
There's nothing dirtier than that!
The place is so disgusting that I really don't lick anything here."
Wright produced a documentary film Ian Wright – On the trail of inner power in cooperation with Valio.
From Valio, Wright received Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which helps to strengthen the good bacterial strain and resistance in the gut.
Niko Vuorenmaa, the category manager of Valio's snack, juice and novelty products, said: "We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time tells about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time thinking about something crazy, and finally we came to the idea of asking Ia to come."
Intestinal health has become a global trend.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to bring them into a wider context and tell about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it relates to resistance.
Intestinal health has become a global trend, and the documentary allows us to give consumers more information about it in an interesting way.
The film also tells about our sense of humor!"
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: "Let's say I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked certain items we asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet, which is also shown in the film.
Naturally, licking some targets was easier for Ian, while some were pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty licks on tape."
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 per cent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria with the well-being of the stomach and intestines in particular, and 58 per cent said they used at least occasionally products to which lactic acid bacteria have been added.
The disturbance family destroyed a city-owned rental house in Saltash, Cornwall, before they were evicted
The dysfunctional family left behind the £50,000 damage to a town-owned rental house after they were evicted because of the terror in the neighborhood.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock have been evicted from Cornwall's Saltash apartment after numerous complaints against the couple.
After the couple had been forced to leave the apartment, representatives of the rental housing company said the apartment was in a state of renovation.
There were gaping holes in the walls, floorboards had been torn off, trash had been spread on the floors, and walls had been stained with graffiti.
The couple has now moved, and they are believed to live in a private apartment.
Donna McEvoy, head of Cornwall Housing, says she fears that the apartment may no longer be saved.
He says: "This has been a nightmare for people living here, nobody should have to put up with this.
There is a lot to weigh, since the property is likely to be known as not such a pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious, as is its name."
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment from time to time, and according to the police, the family's reign of terror included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of local residents, drug use and drug trafficking, and loud shouting, fighting and swearing.
In June, 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed the lease, received an antisocial behaviour order.
In several rooms of the house under the threat of demolition, old waste was found.
Previously, drugs had been sold from the house, and floorboards had been ripped off.
Neighbors said the family fought on the street and the police had to call regularly.
Cornwall Housing Office evicted the couple by coercive means this week after giving them 11 more weeks to move out voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors were grateful for the eviction - they said their lives were hell on earth.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We have lived next door to them for 20 years, and all that time has been difficult.
The police have been here an incredible number of times."
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we're not used to it!
It will be wonderful now that they have finally been evicted."
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornwall Housing Agency, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which the police were regularly called.
Garbage and old toys had been thrown to the crazed wall of the rental house.
Fitzpatrick adds: "It's a shame the tenant didn't take any responsibility for his own and his family's behaviour, because eviction is always the last measure Cornwall Housing Department is considering.
This incident was very difficult, as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been shocking to the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my team, Devon and Cornwall police and community members who took part in the work and courageously offered to give us information.
I hope that this progress will improve the well-being of our neighbours and send a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated."
Fitzpatrick says that the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but were already in their 20s.
A dirty mattress found in one of the bedrooms after eviction
Housing workers must now clean away the piles of waste around the house.
The police raided the apartment in 2014 and found over 70 grams of cannabis and also scales and other items, as well as £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for being found guilty of possession of Class B drugs with the intention of selling it.
He claimed the money was for the tombstone of his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, Skeldon and her husband have been heard to have moved to a private apartment in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were stained with graffiti.
Police say they are demanding eviction for tenants who violate the rules of the leases.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall police say this eviction serves as a clear warning to tenants who constantly defy the rules.
"This is a clear message for those who think they can behave as they want without charges, as well as for those who suffer from such behaviour," says Crow.
Devon and Cornwall police will never accept criminal and antisocial behaviour, and will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
A low-flying, beach-hiding military jet frightened tourists in Portugal
Sun worshipers experienced the shock of their lives in Aveiro, Portugal.
The Portuguese Air Force's P-3C Orion plane crashed at a staggering low altitude.
According to the Air Force, it was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
The picture shows the moment when tourists panicked, as a low-flying jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic images show how an army plane comes near contact with tourists sun-sunning on the beach in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers rose to their feet when they were understandably concerned about the roar of jet engines that began to sound before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of those who photographed the dramatic pass and the videos on social media were Daniel Fernandes, who said: "It passed the beach twice at very low altitude, and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash."
Nuno Arroja adds: "I was surfing and I was sure the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were shocked when the plane suddenly appeared and flew at a staggering low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify coastal fishing vessels, which meant the plane had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly a bit lower than normal, because the smoke caused by nearby forest fires was negative for visibility, but the air force said this did not threaten anyone's safety.
Forest fires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal and killed four people on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that because of the poor visibility caused by heavy fog and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The plane was on a training flight in which the pilot was asked to identify fishing vessels.
Exote's first half result better than expected
South Karelia Social and Health Care District (Exote) made 3.4 million euros better than planned in January - June.
Eksote's result was 4.3 million euros in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all operations.
This year Eksote aims to shorten the queues of measures.
Exote covers a deficit previously created with a surplus.
The excess of it may be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The result for the whole year is expected to be 4.6 million euros better than planned.
Eksote's board will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special border soldiers swore a military oath in Immola
The 70 conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School swore a military oath on Friday.
The military oath ceremony of the Rangers of the Border and Coast Guard School was held in Immola on Friday.
The oath event of the 10th Special Border Jääkäri course was organised on the military field.
The military oath was taken by 70 conscripts.
Special border soldiers are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied to be a special border soldier.
250 of them were invited to the selection tests.
Special border soldiers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans from the wartime border forces attended a veteran meeting in connection with the jury.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who participated in the event were born in 1918.
A circle ahead of a bandit - criminal intelligence helps solve crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
From the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 police departments in Finland has operated a RTA unit, i.e. criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The unit's operation is invisible outwards.
In Häme Police Department, the unit consists of a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's run by a Sergeant stationed in Lahti.
Chief of Staff is Chief of Staff in Lahde.
In addition, the unit's strength includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone's working in a civilian uniform.
The unit has proved its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces different explanations for the rest of the police.
In Häme, for example, it has acquired information about asylum seekers.
Latest reform of working methods
The establishment of analysis units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The goal has been to prevent crime, that is, to keep the police from turning up more and more often when they get an alarm.
With the information collected and analysed by the unit, the daily police activity is targeted where it is most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence centre, less than three national units were established in the country, and their own criminal intelligence unit for each police department.
In Vantaa, the PTR Centre, which is operating in connection with the Central Crime Police, is the national leader.
PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and Border Guard as their name suggests.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas divided by police departments, and their task is to provide information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond your own territory
While the individual police are aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is going on throughout the police department's area.
Intelligence also extends beyond the limits of your own department, because so does crime.
Those working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the primary police.
Through registers, an alert task database and observations, the unit aims to draw police attention to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes.
This is called a series, and it is one of the most important tools in criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible in the work, whether honest or criminal.
Based on the method used, the unsub is a certain image.
The compilation can be done either on the basis of the method of making or on the basis of the person, depending on which police have more information about.
Criminals Learn From Their Mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit don't walk around the city with their collars up, but their work is not entirely public either.
There is no information about the methods used by both criminals and their own, because it could lead to professional criminals developing their operations to try and prevent police attempts to combat crime.
The police will state these methods publicly if they anticipate a threat.
For example, this case was reported in early summer, the method of marking empty apartments used in house break-ins.
In it, the people put a stick, a pin or a piece of tape on the front door of the apartment to test whether the residents were really travelling.
The pre-trial material must be made public at least for the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they make.
The cleverer order the District Court minutes, which may, for example, show that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
Next time, we're going to steal with gloves on.
The case has been interviewed by Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppänen from the Häme Police Department, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police Department, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärvi from the Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Crime Police Department.
The police collect and analyse information that is used to plan practical operations.
In the background, the reduction in labour and funding volumes.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken already 30 years ago.
The latest change was a three-stage PORA reform that ended at the end of the year 2013.
The national cooperation collects information from outside the boundaries of Finland and its own department.
A London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
The news reports that one of the three British schoolchildren who joined ISIS last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
Tasname Akunjee, a lawyer, said the girl's family heard Sultana died in Syria's Raqqa a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in a Russian air strike against Raqqa, an ISIS base in Syria, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, was just planning to escape from a war-torn country and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that this will serve as a warning example and a will, so people will understand that this is a real risk when going to a war zone - and that it will cause people to give up their decision to leave," Akunjee said.
Sultana boarded a plane to Turkey in February 2015 together with two other East London schoolgirls and continued on a bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married an Isis fighter in Syria and had been widowed only a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland's appointment to the Supreme Court if he is elected
Senate Democratic Director Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Merrick Garland as Supreme Court judge if he is elected president.
The Senate Republicans have not agreed to strengthen Garland's appointment since Barack Obama appointed him in March.
According to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, the next president will choose a person to fill the post of late Supreme Court judge Antoni Scalia.
Reid said at a teleconferencing meeting on Thursday that he predicts Clinton will choose Garland "unquestionably."
Reid's spokesman later pointed out that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't want to "wig the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeal in Columbia County District.
Reid says the Republicans blocking Garland's nomination are the presidential candidate Donald Trump's "spoken" and "advisors."
According to him, Trump is not fit for office.
According to Treats magazine, naked calendars belong as well to women as men
Treats magazine works with photographer David Bellemere to launch a 1970s-style calendar inspired by Pirelli for 2017.
Instead of celebrity nude models, they want to find next generation top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats CEO Steve Shaw said earlier this year that his naked newspaper differs from the old school Playboys, as he said: "Playboy is for men.
I'm doing this for women."
Apparently, he feels the same way about the calendar.
"We need to bring back timeless and classic nudity, where women, just like men, can enjoy and be inspired by these pictures that praise the female body without any effort," said Shaw in a press release about the calendar.
"I'm sure the women want to take part in this project because it will be a beautiful work of art."
Those who want to use the calendar as a model can send their photos online or attend open selections in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl's charm: who buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you have time to write in the comment section your angry protest under the title "Not All LonelyMiddleMen", this claim is based on actual research data.
According to YouGov's research company, the new appearance of much-spoken vinyl records is not behind a Millenial generation's boom when the Millenials want to feel a physical object in their hands, but instead there is middle-aged nostalgia in the background.
The person who recently bought the vinyl album is most likely to be aged between 45 and 54.
In fact, those in the 18-24 age group are the least likely buyers.
It is also not just a matter of the enthusiasts' desire to keep records, but of emotional importance: older vinyl records buyers are slightly more likely to hide their feelings (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs. 66%).
But is YouGov's results true?
If this blog were a televised newscast, the camera would follow me as I walked along the lively Soho Street, wearing a grey suit with no strings attached to it. I'd make a lively gesture, bend my hand into a cup and say something traditional, like, "Let's find out."
So let's find out.
Even though Soho has slowly lost its charm and roughness, as hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperbase chains have taken over the premises owned by private entrepreneurs, there are still a handful of special record shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to stop the camera for a moment, as I get very close to the men visiting these shops and try to measure their age and character.
Stuart, 55 from Glasgow, followed by Sister Ray (currently two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (currently eight middle-aged men, probably a 20-year-old woman) is on a meeting trip to London for the afternoon and spends extra time on the supply of shops.
I'll see if he's a collector.
"I think I am," he says.
"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records."
These records fill his living room wall, as you can see from the picture. (Stuart emailed me the photo, I didn't follow him home.)
The reason he has acquired so many albums and singles is partly in his disposable income, and he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they first appeared and buy again things he had had to sell when he was young and broke.
"I got a lot of stuff in the late '60s and early '70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 and probably too young to get it," he said.
He agrees that those who buy vinyl records are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, adding: "I don't smoke, and I don't drink much.
It's my vice."
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of their customers fit the YouGov profile.
But he has discovered a new stream of people affected by media hopping, who have heard about vinyl records coming back and now feel compelled to buy their old records back.
"In my discussions, people had usually given up their collections around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back their vinyl," he said.
This may explain the boom of vinyl wake-ups of a certain age.
What about the alleged emotional significance of the records?
In just a few seconds, you realize in a movement like Phonica that they offer a comforting community for like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers have been particularly upset about the contactless payment system.
Some vinyl fans may be overwhelmed by the digital world, for returning to familiar record cases means permanence and remind of the lucky days of youth.
"I think it sometimes fills a gap, or material possessions are acquired for some kind of comfort," Wez said.
"That's how I feel as a collector myself, and I think so many others too.
It's an easy way to get your mind off things."
"We're like social workers!" said Wez's co-worker from behind the record stack.
A April ICM opinion poll revealed that nearly 50% of the people who bought the vinyl album in the previous month had not yet listened to their record.
A poll also said that 41 per cent have a record player they never use, and 7 per cent of vinyl record buyers don't have a record player of their own.
At this point in the newscast, I would probably show a serious face while browsing a stack of bossa nova collections.
There is also a "poecal phenomenon" that Jonny, 42, who is selling the Sounds of the Universe (three middle-aged men as customers at the time) has discovered.
"A customer recently came to the store and said he doesn't have a record player, but he wants to buy a Radiohead record so he can put it on his shelf," Jonny says.
"It is not a large proportion of such customers, but they still do.
For them, materiality is more important than music.
Some of our customers say they don't have a record player yet.
They are younger, not older, largely teenagers who are just starting a hobby."
The customer base is much more varied in Fop, to which I come next. The store has dedicated a whole floor to vinyl records.
There are 70-year-old couples, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The diversity of customers is a delight, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in previous movements: instead of the jazz rocking from speakers, Wild Beasts' latest sex-stacking synthesizer pop.
None of the customers look particularly lonely, but it is difficult to detect a gnawing psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes and has watched a variety of discs on sale.
He's looking rather than shopping.
He says his income is low, so collecting records is not possible for him.
"They cost a lot.
The music is easy to listen to from a computer or otherwise, but the finest beauty is ...', he lets go of the enchanted sigh and continues:
"I can't explain, they're so unique."
My last stop is a shop that is said to have inspired the new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I see a bunch of teenage girls who would imagine jumping around in jeans shorts, but who, instead, gather around Polaroid cameras for a while, seeing a father and daughter thinking about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a staircase with a wall filled with records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, key records for any average collection.
No one is looking at the wall, maybe because they're just an interior element and part of it so high that they can't even reach them.
They're pure "art vinyl."
But given that all the means to get attention to these records may mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to Soho, there is little to complain about.
It is no surprise that the population group, most likely to have more time and money than most, also has the group that spends most money on luxuries, such as vinyl records.
Even though my research suggests that YouGov's results are true, at least in Soho's record stores, they do not exclude a large number of female collectors and vinyl fans that actually exist in both record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely attached to school or working.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday mornings groping around the record shops on Berwick Street, browsing through records and avoiding a 30-year-old who plays a TV runner who stares scaryly and looks at unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holker or ice shark is the longest living vertebrate - video report
According to researchers, the longest living vertebrate on earth is an ice shark.
According to shark researcher Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice shark was aged between 272 and 512 years, a female of five metres in length.
The French court rejected the application for the dismantling of the jungle camp shops
The French court has rejected the Calais authorities' application for the dismantling of dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in a jungle camp inhabited by thousands of refugees.
In a court hearing this week, Calais authorities made claims that the state should be allowed to break up 72 temporary shops set up in a refugee camp, selling the residents of a refugee camp a variety of things from tobacco to energy drinks and offering haircuts, and buying tea for 50 cents or basic meals in temporary restaurants for a few euros.
According to Calais' prefects authorities, these shops and restaurants must be dismantled because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent the grey economy and are associated with fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian aid groups told the court that shops and restaurants are essential to the camp, because free meals offered by a state-supported organisation and others are not enough for the growing population of the camp.
According to them, temporary shops and restaurants often offer shelter and free food to those in need.
Lille's court ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of 72 temporary shopkeepers, but considered the concerns of the Calais Prefect to be "fully understandable."
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants in the camp are of much greater importance than simply offering food to people who "live in extremely unstable conditions."
He says they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet.
One of the places under threat of demolition was the Jungle Book Kids, a non-profit cafe offering 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum advice to hundreds of unaccompanied minors in the camp who are the most vulnerable.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition requiring children's cafe to be maintained.
According to a letter to the Guardian, its closure "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that after the sharp increase in summer arrivals, the population of the jungle camp has risen to a record-breaking, more than 9,000 lives.
Food prices fall clearly faster in Finland than the EU average
Food in Finland will fall sharply to the satisfaction of consumers and to the shame of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by nearly five per cent in three years, while the average price in EU countries fell by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, in Germany and Sweden, food has become one per cent more expensive.
In the last three years, the price of food has fallen most in Finland among the EU countries with the same wage level as in Finland.
From analogue countries only in Britain, food prices have fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are based on an article by Statistics Finland's development manager Ilkka Lehtinen, published in the Tieto & Trends blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices that are related to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data are from June this year.
At the beginning of the 2010s, the price of food rose sharply.
In 2013, prices rose close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then a turn of events followed, after which food has become cheaper year by year.
Now the price is weighed by Russian bans on food imports, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
That is why the supply of dairy and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term," Lehtinen says.
Increased price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in the price.
The large chains of stores S Group and Kesko have both decreased their prices.
For the consumer, price competition has been shown as spectacular advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not a place for cheap food, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland from EU countries with wage levels similar to those in Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by value added tax.
He found that if the control countries had the same rate of value added tax, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with similar pay levels.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the control countries, only Germans and Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to get to the old EU countries' level of food prices, VAT should be halved to the EU average and continue the price competition," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that the calculations he has made at VAT rates are indicative.
School's not quite what it used to be.
Anyone returning to school may find that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been prepared for schools, which will be implemented in all primary schools at the beginning of the semester.
It is a rule that all schools in Finland operate.
The schools decide the details themselves, but the plan tells the official goals.
The new guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ in many ways from the old ones.
For example, the learning of the arts is abandoned, and instead, the schools begin to practice coding.
Swedish education starts in the sixth grade at the latest, and social studies begin already on four.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of students.
It used to be thought that the teacher was teaching the students, but now everyone needs to be active and learn from each other.
This is how you try to make school more interesting.
The world's longest-lived vertebrate was found - an ice shark can live up to 400 years
The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus), even known as ice sharks, does not reach maturity until 150 years old.
It can live another 250 years after that, reports a new study.
The numbers make the sport the longest-lived vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it is passed only by an Icelandic clam whose oldest known specimen has been dated to 507.
Greenland sharks swim along the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are one of the biggest fish in the Arctic.
The females stretch longer than the males, they can grow to more than five metres.
Because the rate of growth is slow, according to the follow-up, only about a centimetre a year, adult individuals have been forced to live for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues from the University of Copenhagen found out.
He defined the adult ice sharks from the age of 28 females that had been caught by fishermen.
The age of fish was revealed by radiocarbon dating of eye lenses.
The average age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The two biggest fish in the sample, 593 and 502 centimetres, were found to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have found that the female ice sharkes only reach maturity by more than four metres, the researchers calculated that they are about 150 years old at that stage.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann fired for nearly 300 - sellers will not be deducted
Nearly 300 employees are made redundant from Stockmann department store company.
Co-operation companies in a company that got into difficulties ended in the beginning of August.
"As a result of the negotiations, about 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will be made redundant," Stockmann said in his statement.
According to the report, the number of department stores sellers will not be reduced so that the customer service will not suffer.
In addition, about 80 support workers are offered new jobs as a seller.
Stockmann's negotiations involved about 3,000 employees.
When they began, the need for deduction was estimated to be about 380 employees.
The reduction of the population is aimed at annual cost savings of about €20 million, which are expected to come true next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme to save €50 million this year.
The background is Stockmann's difficulties in making the department store profitable.
Even though the Group's adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the department store trade still makes losses.
According to Stockmann's acting CEO Lauri Veijalainen, sales in department stores have not reached the company's goals.
"Unfortunately, staff cuts are necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail's positive operating result in 2018," Veijalainen said in a statement.
The second quarter result improvement was based especially on the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best second-quarter turnover and result ever.
Lindex' operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
Last year, the Group's operating result for the whole Stockmann Group was 4.1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperature below 20 degrees in the whole country
The low-pressure centre on the northern part of Finland will keep the weather rainy on Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
There will also be rain showers in the central parts of the country, but southward is pouty.
The temperature is not very summery any more, as mercury remains below 20 degrees in the whole country.
In the rainy areas of the north, 10-15 degrees.
Kenya's athletics team is shaken by the doping scandal - an odd explanation for the coach's move
Kenyan athletic coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it turned out that Anzrah was a national athlete in a doping test.
The news agency AP said the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is the 800-metre star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of Kenya's national team, said that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had given a sample as Rotich in the surprise test.
Doping officials went to report Anzrah to the authorities.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because he "did his crime against the Kenyan national team."
He performed as an athlete, gave a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour," Kip Tei, chairman of the Kenya Olympic Committee, thundered at Reuters news agency.
The Olympic athletics will begin on Friday, and Rotich is due to run right then and then.
It is not yet known whether the runner will be aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth in the World Championship last year and has already won Rio's favourites.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan athletics team claimed that Anzrah only went on an athlete's accreditation card to get free meals in the race village.
When anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid he would be exposed," the source said.
Where is everyone?
Rio athletics stadium rubbers its void
Where is everyone?
At least not in Rio Olympic Stadium watching athletics.
On Friday, a battle began in Rio about athletics medals, but the world's top individuals were allowed to present their skills to a confusingly empty stands.
The Rio organisers said on Friday that only 58 per cent of the first-day morning tickets and 65 per cent of the evening tickets have been sold.
The other one was in London four years ago, where the stadium was bulging about cheering people.
The tickets to the finals have already been sold out in Rio.
The loss of audience at the Rio Olympics has attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, there have been thousands of empty seats in the stands of rugby, canoeing and riding.
When Brazil's medal hopes for Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the stands were full.
After the Brazilian duo, Holland played against Russia, and about 30 per cent of the 12,000 stands were full.
The bad deal is explained at least by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with economic difficulties, is far away for European and Asian racing tourists, and many of the Olympic sports are strange for Brazilians used to football.
True, even the first match of the Brazilian football team did not fill the football stadium.
At the weekend, event organisers' spokesman Mario Andrada said that 82 per cent of the tickets had been sold at that time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million endings left to sell," Andrada said according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets for the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, even though the tickets cost almost half more than in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from about nine euros to over a thousand euros at the opening.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty spaces, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed, because the organisers need money and try to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, however, organisers have given 240 000 tickets to schoolchildren in the country for less well-known sports, such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty seats at Rio Stadium in the morning.
Even a beach volleyball on Copacaba sand has not interested the audience.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London 2012.
There were plenty of people in the gallery.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation by new means.
The Foundation, founded last year, acquires ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, private, companies and communities can use money to claim holder rights on the land.
The Foundation has acquired its first land area in Lapland.
The land area is virtually divided into blocks that those who want to acquire the right to wear for a fee.
The holder will have a veto in his 187-square block, which in practice means that not every holder will be required to be approved if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
You can also acquire holder rights for several blocks.
Acquiring a right of control is something concrete that you can leave as an inheritance or as a gift.
You don't have to carry banners or chain yourself somewhere to protect the environment," Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired the right of control for his company, explains.
Those who have acquired the right of control will receive precise location information from their block, allowing for example a visit to the block.
The names of those who have acquired the rights of the holder appear on the Foundation's website on the same map where the land block information can be found.
Leviäkangas sees its nature conservation acquisition as a risk only that the Foundation's operations change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been founded as a non-profit foundation to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the Foundation would act unethically or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea behind the Helsinki Foundation's Haltija project is to protect nature areas in such a way that they can be intact and at peace.
The Foundation acquires land either by buying or by making a donation.
It finances its operations mainly through the sale of holders' rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims outside Finland's borders and plans to buy land in Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its operations in a pop-up forest at Helsinki Market Square on August 13-19.
The bike thieves torment Turkey the worst in the big cities - see the situation in your municipality
The bike thieves torment Turkey the worst in Finland's big cities.
This year more bikes have been stolen in proportion to the population than in nine other major cities.
According to the bike thefts reported to the police, Helsingin Sanomat found out how many bicycles and parts of them have been stolen in the ten largest cities in January to August of this year, calculated per 1,000 inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti took the lead.
According to police records, there were four to five bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
Instead, in Espoo and Kouvola, police were reported only about two bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
It's a big difference.
"There are double thefts in other cities relative to the population," police inspector Tommi Reen describes.
Turku police wonder why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
"The frequency of thefts can be affected by how much people ride bikes in the city and how many bikes there are at all," says Sergeant Teemu Äikäs.
Tommi Reen from the police department thinks it is quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will take the lead in comparison.
The number of bike thefts goes largely according to what are the study and cycling cities.
Turku has a tight centre, short distances and lots of bikes available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city, where city centres are distant from each other and bicycles are not necessarily the primary means of transport," Reen says.
In all of Finland, slightly fewer bike thefts have come to the police's attention in January-August than in the corresponding period last year.
But there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, police report just over 20,000 bike thefts every year.
It means 50-60 bikes every day and about 4,000 bikes a year in Helsinki alone.
"They're big amounts," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more bikes, because only some of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report bike theft, even if fewer than one in 10 reported cases are solved.
Typical solved bike theft is one where police are immediately informed of the theft and the thief is caught freshly.
"You can also find cases in other investigations, when, for example, stolen bikes can be found in a drug-related apartment," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught every week in connection with the act itself or in connection with a police investigation, says senior officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bikes are stolen from, for example, the bike racks, courtyards, warehouses and bike cellars at shopping centres, i.e. practically everywhere they are usually kept.
As in previous years, Jopas are the most stolen of individual bike models.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves take the bike for their short-term use, for example, but a large part of the stolen bikes end up on the market, for example, via the Internet.
They remain on the domestic market.
"At least it hasn't come to the police's attention that stolen bikes are going abroad much," Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
Some will probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about that.
The buyer of a used bike must be vigilant, as he may be guilty of a concealment offence or a breach.
"The alarm bells should be ringing if a bike in good condition is sold at a price that is clearly underpriced," Reen says.
Special library officer Severi Hirvi carries his colorful Nopsa to the shelters of the Kallio library in Helsinki for the duration of his working day.
He has had five bikes, but none have been stolen, says Hirvi. "It has never been taken, it has been a good monk."
"Maybe this isn't so attractive to thieves, it doesn't necessarily have hipster value," Hirvi from Helsinki ponders.
Siiri Valve, who was in a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, quickly locked her bike with a small U-lock.
Now the bike pecked against the wall of the kiosk, but usually Valve locks his bike on something solid, like a bike rack.
"It's going to be a lot of thought, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," says a student from Helsinki about his white bicycle, the frame of which alone cost about 500 euros.
"All the time you hear from your friends that bikes have been stolen."
"Most of the time bad spins, such slob Jokos."
A year ago, a bike was stolen from Valve himself from the courtyard of the housing company.
But the bike had not been locked, so Valve was expecting it to be taken.
Persons under 15 years of age to be held accountable for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer jury members familiar from the United States
In Helsinki, a so-called peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from getting caught in a criminal cycle.
Initially, the experiment will apply to those under the age of 15, who are now left without criminal liability.
The peer jury is addressing the first crime committed by a young person.
The idea is that the peer jury will discuss the incident with the offender and impose a sanction.
A week later, the offender can join the peer jury himself to make up for what he did.
There may be other consequences, for example a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Laitio, director of youth services, says the model is not tight.
We have other mediation models that are used side by side.
"All of the youth's actions are directed in a more responsible direction, so that everything would not be ruined by the first mistake," Laitio says.
The peer jury has been modeled on the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that a young person, after his first crime, will not be faced with an adult panel, but will reflect on what happened with people about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Iikka Lovio, a service designer at Palmu service design agency that followed the experiment, said it was an assault that was successfully solved.
The first crimes, especially those under the age of 15, have not necessarily been dealt with at all before.
"It's been a message to continue on the path you've chosen," Lovio says.
The peer jury is part of the Helsinki project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new practices are offered to all those who need it, not just to young immigrants.
More than 70 Republican leaders want the party to stop funding Trump's campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the American newspaper Politico, who had received a draft of it.
According to the newspaper, the open letter is addressed to the President of the National Republican Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money to be directed to congressional elections instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump and his indifference, incompetentness and record displeasure threaten to bring a landslide to the Democrats in these elections," the letter said Politico.
Only direct targeting of all possible funds to the congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning with a Trump-crowned anchor around their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential election are decreasing day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent in the course of next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organisers of the letter is prominently anti-Trump Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress" and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists a number of Donald Trump's actions that are believed to have hurt millions of voters.
He is also said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for U.S. families with children
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton reported on the details of his economic policy on Thursday evening.
I'm running for president to make the U.S. economy go well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is running for president to make the economy work well for him and his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
Clinton's plan focuses on a massive $275 billion five-year programme to improve U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be partly financed by the tax increases of the rich, partly by private money.
The construction programme is a hand-to-hand hand for American workers who suffered as the factories moved to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme the biggest investment in well-paid jobs after World War II.
We are a builder's people, we must go back to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to make it easier for working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders anyway, pointing out that the rich should pay their fair share of the taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it will have to pay the departure tax, Clinton said.
Today he opposes the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he once supported.
"I, as the President, am opposed to any trade agreements that work against employees or wages," Clinton promised.
According to speculations published by The Washington Post before Clinton's speech, Clinton intended to criticise Republican Donald Trump's financial programme on Monday for "only favoring millionaires like this one."
Mr. Clinton has previously called a "Trump loophole" a discount on corporate taxes proposed by Mr. Trump.
On Thursday, Clinton emphasised that she herself was the daughter of a small entrepreneur.
He reminded listeners of small entrepreneurs, whose bills Trump has left unpaid, and of the clothes Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start by making his own products in America," Clinton said.
These are the ratings of Rio: the competitions have not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile app is interesting
Usually sports competitions are shown in TV viewer statistics as sharp peaks.
So far, the Rio Olympics have not reached a great number of viewers.
At a time, the competitions have glued 12 per cent of the population to the screens: at the same time, 615 000 viewers from Yle's Olympic channel TV2 followed the swim on Tuesday night.
For comparison: the European athletics competitions one month ago got close to 800,000 viewers at a time, and the European Football Championships got well over a million.
The most interesting of the Olympic sports have so far been Sunday night cycling and the gymnasium that opened the fifth day of the race, both of which reached almost half a million viewers on the Olympic channel at a time.
Yle sports chief Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the ratings and reminds that the viewers will be divided into several different instruments for the first time in the Rio Olympics.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympic Games from Rio Areena.
We are pleased with how many TV viewers choose the Olympics in the first place.
Even on the television side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sporting events Yle has dedicated an entire channel to.
When broadcast 24 hours a day, from 20,000 to 500 000 viewers all the time, it is a good basis.
The ratings are smaller than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - most of Rio's competition broadcasts come in Finland during the night.
Another reason for the weak interest - if someone thinks it's lame - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the early games, the interest would have bounced up with it.
In addition, athletics is just beginning, as are other species of interest to Finns: sailing and riding.
According to Pokkinen, the initial ratings have been close to what was expected.
When athletics begin, ratings explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the games, which in the first days of the Games rose to the Apple App Store as the most downloaded free app in Finland.
By Monday, the application had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'd say we're already going around 200,000 downloads.
"We won't get online ratings until later," Pokkinen says
Rio Areena hasn't worked as well as it would have been for all users.
Pokkinen says feedback has come and the faults have been corrected.
The use of Rio Areena has been accompanied by a delay and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
There are updated versions of the apps that should correct the errors.
The Rio Olympics are more visible on Yle's channels and in the arena than any other sporting event ever before.
Some sports can be watched on Yle Fem, and Yle Speech broadcasts the games on the radio every day.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborious for Yle ever, but also the last to be followed only by Yle channels.
From 2018, Olympic sports will be visible on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, which has a depth of 95,3 metres on Ristinselkä.
It may be even deeper.
Technology diving instructor Matti Kannela found about 20 square metres of pressure on Ristiselkä, the bottom of which was shown to be 104 metres by the diving computer.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried to strengthen the observation in vain by sonaring.
The method does not necessarily find a small depth in 100 metres, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So so far, the official depth is still 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes are Inarijärvi (92 metres) and Suvasvesi (90 metres).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi reach over 80 metres.
They have not been studied as closely as Päijänne.
Especially the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully charted.
"There could well be unknown depths," Kannel says.
If the deepest lake is defined by average depth, it is the Great Yukajärvi, 23 metres.
Viewed in this way, Päijänne does not make it to the top ten, and Suvasvesi is even further from the top.
Correction August 12th at 2.29 p.m.: The last paragraph corrected, where the deepest lakes in the middle depth were wrong.
Ihalainen from the tax discount: Pensioners' taxation still tighter
Pensioners' taxation is still tighter than employees.
Ihalainen says that the incident was raised under parliamentary elections and the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to the employees.
The Government's proposal does not contain this.
We think it should definitely be there.
The promises given should be followed after the election, he says to the media in the West.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received labour income reductions that reduced taxation.
The matter was heated up in parliament by opposition representatives who grilled Alexander Stubb, then Minister of Finance, for election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
According to Ihalainen, the policy presented by the Minister of Finance, Petteri Orpo, is mainly about securing purchasing power and not increasing it, because next year wages will not be raised.
He says the tax reduction will have a positive effect on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with Prime Minister Juha Sipilä's (Central) and Orpo's messages about the desire to respect the hard-won competitiveness pact.
He says sticking to the contract is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the reign.
It is done with the strength of the labour market organisations, so it should not be ruined by questioning.
It is necessary because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people's own faith in the future.
To tackle long-term unemployment in a row
Ihalainen appeals to the government to tackle long-term unemployment, at least to stop its growth, in the budget line.
In June, there were about 17,000 more long-term unemployed than a year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's goal of raising the employment rate to 72 per cent will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very big social fall.
Ambassador: There are no known Finnish victims in Thailand's attacks
At least four people died in the bombings that took place in Thailand last night and last night in Finland.
The embassy urges the Finns in the country to pay attention and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the authorities' instructions.
Finnish tourists planning to travel to Thailand should not cancel their journey because of the explosions, but the embassy's advice on caution should be followed, says Westphalen.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish travel season to Thailand dates back to the turn of the year.
The majority of Thailand tourists come from Southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The embassy has tried to reach out specifically to Finns in Hua Hin to get information about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be fine, says Westphalen.
No information about the unsub
According to Westphalen, the person responsible for the attacks is still unknown.
The ambassador thinks that the events may be related to the political unrest in Thailand's divided society and to last week's referendum on the constitution drawn up by the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people in the country were arrested who said they were against the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, the ethnic national conflict surrounding the Muslim population is smouldering, says Westphalen.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today is a big, local holiday in Bangkok, says Westphalen.
According to him, the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks should have an effect on the day's course, so that the authorities are very precise about security.
Thai police: The attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been ruled out, according to the Thai police news agency AP.
At least four people have died in Thailand in 24 hours after 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as the tourist-like Phuket and Hua Hin.
In a tourist attraction favoured by Finns, the holiday island Phuket had four bombs exploded in the night, says Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current information, they did not kill.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the newspaper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where, according to the newspaper, one person was wounded.
In the popular tourist destination Hua Hin, a total of four bombs have exploded yesterday and today, according to local authorities.
At least one died in both double bombings.
In addition, in southern Thailand, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Thani and in the town of Trang.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it is used to travel to the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The person responsible for the attacks is unknown
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the military junta in Thailand, the attacker is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not stir people up to panic any more, he said to the reporters.
According to Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, Deputy Prime Minister for Security, at least the attacks by Hua Hin and Trang are connected.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators have been meant to destroy the country's tourism, because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy urges the Finns in the country to pay attention and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the authorities' instructions.
There is no reason for Finns to cancel their journey to Thailand because of the explosions, but it is worth heeding the advice of the great ambassador about caution, says Westphalen.
Europeans who have been wounded
So far, very little is known about the attacks that took place during the night in Finland and their victims.
A little more information about the attack last night in Hua Hin has been obtained.
A local woman died and more than 20 others were wounded, including at least nine foreign tourists.
There are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians among the wounded.
At least three people were wounded in Hua Hin's second attack.
Two bombs exploded near a bell tower known as a tourist attraction.
Thai PBS says the police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where they think they have found another bomb.
According to the governor of the province, Surat Than's bomb was hidden in a flowerbed.
An employee of the municipality died in the attack.
There's at least one wounded.
The CNN-interviewed police chief said that two bombs were also used in Surat Than's attack, which exploded about every half-hour.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles won the women's four-game
U.S. Alexandra Raisman was second with a score of 60.098, and Russian Alija Mustafina was third with a score of 58.665.
Biles, 18, is still in pursuit of stand championships on the floor, jumping and boom.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics as much as possible in recent years.
He has eight personal world championships from three previous seasons.
He has won the four-game and permanno championships three times in a row and the boom last year and the other year.
In the US team, Biles has achieved two world championships in the team competition.
The Biles have lower World Championship medals with jumps and booms.
Finnish entrepreneur in Thailand: "Isku has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand, and a children's play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of Thailand's bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I don't think there will be anything more amazing about this, estimates Huovila, who has worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about 20 years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many of the tragedies that have hit Thailand nearby.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then avian influenza, and last year there was a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these earlier ones haven't driven out the tourists, I don't think this has.
Huovila's office is located a few hundred metres from the site of the explosion.
Huovila heard about the attack from his own employee.
The employee called at about nine o'clock local time and said it's not worth coming to the office.
Huovila says both the promenade and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning because of the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been set for the Queen's birthday, Huovila said, referring to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open around 10 o'clock local time.
On the beach, many had not even heard of the attacks.
At 2:30 in the day, the traffic at Patong had normalised and a large part of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the point of impact, the explosion has been quite small, Huovila said.
Later, the car was seen in Kruunupyyy on Jouxholmintie.
When the police got there, the car was set on fire.
The patrol spotted two men that fit the description, hiding in a nearby spruce.
The other man was immediately apprehended.
One of them ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft, theft and gross damage to the use of a motor vehicle.
The police thank those who gave the clues.
Research director on Russian leadership changes: Clear removal
The highest-ranking leadership change was made in Russia on Friday in years, when President Vladimir Putin dismissed Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is Anton Vaino, 44 years old, with Estonian background.
He's an ex-diplomat and was Ivanov's number two.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov's dismissal could be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from gathering too much power.
He adds that recycling management tasks is one way of exercising power.
This is a way to prevent people from building power independent of the President for themselves.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been in trouble with other leaders or screwed up.
Post drop to Ivanov
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, will be transferred to special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
On a tape presented by the state media, Putin said the change was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had requested a transfer to another post and proposed Vaino to replace him, said Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says from Ivanov's point of view it is a clear drop in the station.
Environmental and transport issues in Russia are not very high in order of importance.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most significant people at the top of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet era.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, such as governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the Finnish Institute of Foreign Policy says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place is Putin's changing his circle to younger.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield when retreating in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to escape to the city of Jarabulus so we wouldn't aim at them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians had been placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters took control of about 90% of the city of Manbij, which is important to ISIS.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city.
Corrected earlier news at 7:30: Previously we mistold that civilians were fleeing from the city, actually Isis fighters kidnapped civilians while fleeing from the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior's document publicity policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on public access to documents is illegal, says Tomi Voutilainen, professor of public law at the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutilainen says to STT that document access cannot be based on the authority's own policies, but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants for the Minister of the Interior's events to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision with the instructions of the Government Office and the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting file.
The Ministry's Communications Director says to STT that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's final Olympic show begins in Rio
As in recent years, Bolt has been running against time under the ranks.
He hurt his back thighs from the early part of the season and had to skip Jamaica's Olympic qualifyings.
This has not been a perfect preparation, but I am in much better shape.
I've been practicing well, and that's the key, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included samba dancers and journalists turned into fans.
Porina Bolt emphasises that the Jamaican star has risen in the era of athletics struggling with doping scandals and sliding interest.
Bolt's previous defeat in the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he was eliminated in the early 200 metres in 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by injuries and a loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at a hundred metres, with which he crushed the world record and the self-confidence of rivals, despite the final party, at 9,69.
This is harder
A year later, in the Berlin World Championships, Bolt reached his career with a clock.
The world records from Berlin are still valid for 9,58 hundred metres and 19,19 200 metres.
In Rio, Bolt has announced a world record of 200 metres and 19 seconds below, but no one believes in its birth except Bolt himself.
In 100, Bolt's challenger is Justin Gatlin, the Olympic champion of the 100th Olympic Games in Athens 2004.
Last year in Beijing's World Championship final, Bolt defeated the American in just one hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost a single time in the title finals, if only he has made his way.
In Daegu 2011, Bolt missed the $100 World Championship final because of fraud.
Bolt turns 30 in over a week.
He is an old man in a young men's sport, and the Rio Games are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set next year's World Championship in London as the final goal line of the career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the others.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Reveals from Rio: two athletes suspected of doping offence
According to China's state news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi's doping sample found traces of banned substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of a doping offence.
In addition, a Kenyan athletics coach was sent home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of an athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
He was fourth in Rio in women's 100 metres butterfly swim.
According to Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has taken his doping case to the International Court of Appeal for Sports CAS.
Xinhua reports that the sample Xinyi gave on Sunday showed signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping suspicions have also emerged in Rio.
BBC reports that Bulgarian female obstacle runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
Kenya, on the other hand, has sent an athletics coach home from Rio because of a drug abuse.
The International Olympic Committee KOK said on Thursday that Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete in a test situation and had given a doping sample for him.
According to media information, it is Kenyan speed coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had used the racing pass of a 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich.
There's nothing stopping Phelps - historical gold came in the show style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, U.S. Michael Phelps, swam in a 200-metre mix in his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to achieve Olympic gold of the same sport in the fourth consecutive games.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino was second in the mix before China's Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have some fun, the BBC Olympic swim commentator Helen Skelton laughs at Iltalehti's quick interview.
The story about Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read on the Iltalehti website this week.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't put much stress on if there's a little noise in social media or the British press about his revealing and special outfits.
Television is a visual media, he emphasises.
Skelton is wearing high heels and a short dress with certainly at least enough exposure - to the eyes of at least many conservative British viewers.
However, there are no steps backwards.
It's important to look good, and small things are just fun.
I'm sure Skelton wants to startle you and perhaps even startle you, but he emphasises that he doesn't want to play the lead.
It's not about me, he says.
They're here to watch sports, and the focus has to be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the fuss has reached all the way to Finland?
I can't, but anything that points to how hard these swimmers work and how big the sacrifices they make is fine with me, Skelton grins.
You know what?
It's a fuss about nothing if it comes from dressing (the host).
I'm a little amused if someone's radar has been hit with something like this.
Rio Police made two arrests on suspicion of terror
Rio Police announced on Thursday that it has arrested two people for suspected terrorism.
The police made the arrests in connection with the security supervision of the games.
In the same connection, the police made five other arrests and questioned two persons before their release.
All suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news site, persons arrested for terrorism belong to the same group the police arrested already in July.
The arrested are believed to have ties to the Isis organisation.
The detainees had reportedly fuelled violence in social media.
Among other things, the popular WhatsApp service had been used to spread messages that called for violence.
85,000 police officers are responsible for the security of the Rio Games.
Police blew up a suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria had to start their first-string Rio basketball tournament match in an empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place to the audience.
The police let the audience in after they had controlledly detonated the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that police have carried out a controlled blasting mission.
The police closed the arena because of the suspicious package found there.
The crowd got in after police had controlledly detonated the package.
The crowd didn't make it to the stands by the beginning of the match, because the police closed the arena for a while because of the suspicious package found in the hall.
The police blew up the package and let the audience into the hall only after that.
The drink woke up the team of Spain, which had entered the games sleepyly.
Spain, which started the games with two defeats, won Nigeria with a score of 96-87.
In the previous two games Spain reached silver.
The police carried out a controlled blasting mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
Last time the police had to blow up a suspicious discovery near the road biking goal spot last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their first-string Rio basketball tournament in front of empty stands.
Argentinian dame pounded Petäjä-Siren - the Finnish was thinking about protest
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren had a colourful competition day in Rio.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren suffered hard on Thursday.
Argentina's dame kicked Tuuli Petäjä-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening of the women's surfing day.
The winds were clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the offence.
He got stuck because of the crash, and others ran away, said Joakim Wilenius, Finland's head coach.
The athlete considered protest for a long time.
It was not worth doing, because it would have been pointless, according to the Olympic rules.
I should have dropped in the water to get compensation," Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finn hung on his board to the last, because he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
With the crash, the Finn was left in 27th place.
In the overall situation, London's 2012 Olympic silver medalist is the eighth.
When it comes to the track, the crash didn't have much effect.
Friday is a big day when you have to race 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that, according to science, prolong age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring more years to a person's life.
Some of the things are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person's health so that his life lengthens.
Sometimes things that a person can't control themselves can bring him extra years.
These include the tendency to medium-body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can prolong your life.
You don't even have to spend it - just getting a can of milk is enough.
Many studies have been carried out to find out the secret of a long-term life.
Medical Daily presented seven of the most bizarre research results.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drinking has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
Harvard University's study found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a "reduced risk of death", especially with regard to neurological or cardiac diseases.
Again, alcohol is spoken for by studies that say that moderate use - from one to three daily meals - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular flossing can prolong a person's life for more than six years, says one study.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents gum infections.
They, on the other hand, can contribute to the onset of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway found out how laughing affected a person's life span.
The seven-year project watched over 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to be alive after the test ended.
Sex, when the protection against sexually transmitted diseases is considered, is good for your health, according to many studies.
In addition, it can also extend your age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years in his life, he or she should also have an orgasm.
The exercise, of course, will bring additional years, and that will not be disputed.
However, reaching a long age does not require absolute slackness.
One Oxford University study found that women with large butts had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their system.
The same study combined these factors with lower mortality.
Whether it's an athlete or an Oscar-winning actor who got to medals in the Olympics, he's more likely to live longer than an ordinary bungee.
Many studies have tried to find the reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will add years to his or her life.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that the long life is due to the person's social status - which, for its part, makes it possible to seek recognition such as the Nobel Prize.
A study investigating the shopping behaviour of people over 65 found that the person who shopped daily was likely to be older than those who shop less often.
This is because running in concrete shops reduces loneliness.
It has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may lead to early death.
So count your credit card from your hand - online shopping does not, therefore, have the same effect.
A drunk driver who was drunk at the end of the night fell into a lorry
On Friday evening a serious truck and car head-on accident took place in Kosko, Southwest Finland.
The accident took place in Koskella, midway between Koskentie and Sorvastontie on Friday at 9 pm.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car that arrived had drifted into the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the crash, the truck was left in its lane, but it caught fire.
The driver managed to put out the fire himself.
The passenger car derailed into a ditch and then passed over the ditch to its roof.
A woman born in 1972 who drove a passenger car was squeezed in her car.
The rescue department removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to Turku University Hospital for treatment.
The result of the female breath test was 2.02 per mil.
He's suspected of aggravated drunken driving.
Posti sent loose candy to the wrong town
Salon K-Citymarket's loose candy selection was incomplete because the mail had accidentally delivered part of the load to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was buying bulk candy at Salo's K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product defects in bulk confectionery because Posti delivered our load to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when Posti gets the load delivered!
So if there is no traffic in the lawn cutting, the sign said.
The store's foxy sign is related to Posti expanding its services last spring to include lawnmowers.
Weed cutting is on Posti's offer until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing and decided to share it in social media.
I was struck by the popularity of the update.
Representatives of the media have been calling all the time, and the attention that this raises is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia's update had over 700 splits on Facebook.
Haltia was able to grab her favourites into a bag of candy, even though a few laers were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who is responsible for the business of Posti's Companies Transport Services, apologized for the damage to Ilta-Sanomis.
The background is that three of the five pallets got lost in the wrong place yesterday (Säinäjoki) and we stopped doing part delivery (Saloon) in three, but only took five pallets today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
The first news was from Ilta-Sanomat.
Teija Haltia was not indignant about the sign, because she found all her favourite bulk candy in the selection.
Drunk weight loss! 30 kilos lighter Lotta Backlund released a picture of her change
The comedian producer has thinned tens of kilos since the birth of her child.
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of kilos as a result of the change in life.
Lotta shared a picture pair on Friday about her change in Instagram.
Lotta was on a fitness course in the spring and was aiming for normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund started her weight loss work already in 2009.
He has lost about 30 kilos of weight in a comprehensive lifestyle change.
On Friday, Backlund released a pair of pictures of his incredible performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed in appearance over the years.
Backlund's before and after photo pair has gathered several praiseworthy comments from co-sweaters.
You're amazing, though.
On the same journey, motivation is hard!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the "Do It Now" project.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures, as I go on the same journey myself, the other says.
In the spring Lotta dropped the last kilos on the "Do It Now" project.
At that time he told Iltalehti he wanted to finally reach the normal weight, which was then 10 kilos away.
During a three-month fitness course, five kilos eventually fell.
The family's wish for a woman murdered in Loviisa: remembering the victim for police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim will be remembered not with flowers and petitions, but with a donation for police dog work.
Sipoo Veterinarian Centre has released a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim's family's wish for donations to police dogs.
The publication says that the victim had worked as a substitute at Sipoo Veterinarian Station and also had her nursing training there.
The veterinary clinic recalls the woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, with a sense of humor and a fear of work.
Dear Friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update states that the donation money goes to police dogs in its entirety, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisa woman was murdered in her own home yard in Koskenkylä, Loviisa.
The woman's neighbors have said to Iltalehti the victim was a very animal lover.
He owned several animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens and rooster.
The 27-year-old man suspected of murder did not know the woman and they had no connection.
Police dog Börje was involved in the killer's tracking, and he was wounded in a life-threatening situation.
Börje, however, survived and is recovering.
The District Court sentenced Posti for violating the Equality Act
Posti did not have the right to retain the salary of the employee who refused to familiarise the temporary worker, estimates the District Court of Kanta-Häme in its ruling.
The District Court required Posti to pay the employee most of the wages withheld and €2,000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the sentence, Posti could have withheld only part of the initiator's salary that corresponded to the part of the introductory work throughout the day.
According to the District Court, the employee had been put at a disadvantage on the basis of his trade union activity, contrary to the Equality Act.
The employee had followed the PAU's organisation decision to ban the introduction of the Post and Logistics Union.
During last November's postal strike, PAU made a decision not to familiarise Posti employees with temporary workers who break the strike.
People's News first told about the matter.
Turkey's return to the path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights development, written by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (p.a.) in their response to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
Earlier in a letter, the Journalist Association asked Sipilä and Soin to express their concerns about Turkish freedom of speech and press.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland has repeatedly highlighted the importance of press and speech freedom for Turkey.
Putin dismissed the chief of his administration - replaced by Vaino of Estonian origin
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed Sergei Ivanov, head of the presidential administration, says the Kremlin.
Soviet-Estonia Communist leader Karl Vaino's grandson Anton Vaino will take over.
Vaino is a 44-year-old former diplomat, who has been the deputy chief of the presidential administration since 2012.
Vaino will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, says Interfax news agency.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, will be transferred to special tasks in environmental and transport matters, according to the Kremlin press release.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had requested a transfer to another post and proposed Vaino to replace him, says Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era in KGB espionage.
Many considered Ivanov a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed president in 2011 before Putin was re-elected in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant buy-in to a no-play - will not be seen in the opening of the Champion League
The world record man for football transfers will not be seen on the field when England's Champion League is kicked off at the weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban was accompanied to England.
Manchester United's giant purchase Paul Pogba is sidelined as ManU opens its league season on Sunday against Bournemouth, said the BBC on Friday.
According to British media, ManU paid 105 million euros for Pogba to the Italian club Juventus.
However, the English Football Federation FA keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was burdened with a ban on Juventus.
He received two warnings in last season's Italian cup, and it becomes a one-game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, FA told BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is the league's second round on August 19, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, grandeur is a virtue
The exact criteria and ambitious visions of entertainment have established Flow Festival's position as an internationally respected event starred by world's top artists.
Flow Festival will begin on Friday in Helsinki.
Festarians have typically expressed themselves with a distinctive dress.
One of the main stage artists this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is styled with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to have just a main stage and a beer tent, says the artistic director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival in Suvilahti, Helsinki, this weekend has grown from a small block festival to an event of tens of thousands of visitors.
There is a simple question behind the success: What kind of event would the authors themselves want to go to?
It's quite unusual in event production to think like this.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities, says the artistic director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow was going to sell out again this year.
The goal has been to increase last year's 70,000 visitors by 5,000 people.
The festival will also have a series of interesting Finnish and foreign artists this year.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because the work needs to be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we don't want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle being steered on huge routes.
We don't want that.
For 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been magnified, with 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurant points and drinks bars in a partially artificial grassed area.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stage, this year's venue is a tent for 15,000 people.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a bit grandiose, but at the same time we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If you lose it, this isn't our thing anymore.
For Kallio, the greatest joy and reward for the work done is that even great visions are now possible in practice.
In the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, the operations were very dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki of around 20,000 euros.
Last year, the company running Flow had a turnover of about six million euros.
It can be used to produce even "creative things", such as building that 73-metre-wide tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves with a distinctive dress.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not deliberately profiled itself to be particularly fashionable.
Above all, we want to stand out with content.
Still, fashion phenomena also fit Flow's values: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year one of the main stage artists is punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer at the festival that combines indierock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because it's probably the last time we see this at a gig in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
It's not just what's on the commercial radio.
Iggy's latest record is damn good, and he's been doing a hell of a job in recent years.
The bombs in Thailand's tourist paradise were hidden in flower pots - tourists fled in terror
On Thursday evening, two bombs exploded in Hua Hin.
At least one local woman died in the attack and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and detonated with cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreign.
They were detonated at the same time as tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, according to police spokesman Samoer Yoosumran CNN.
Since 1989, Edwin Wiek, a wildlife protector living in Asia, tweeted a talkative picture of the attacks.
If the tweet doesn't show properly, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran up against me and said the bomb exploded at the bars.
It happened in one of the biggest bars, said Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson to Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after that, two bombs exploded on Phuket Island, which was favoured by the Finns.
No one reportedly died.
At the same time, there was another double bomb attack in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were wounded.
In addition, a bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
The police reportedly found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely rebel forces behind the bombings who are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, police have recently taken up the activities of criminal organisations that traffic in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new stand-by forces goes first to battle in a war situation
In an acute war situation, the conscripts are not ordered to fight until several months after the military oath was taken, says Central Finns.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, the head of training in the Defence Forces interviewed by the newspaper, for example, of the conscripts serving 5.5 months in a war situation, only those who are in the final stages of their training are able to fight.
According to the head of training, the first thing they do is assign the reserve members of the stand-by teams.
None of the conscripts or reservists are ordered to perform a task that has not been trained as required, says Sonninen.
Earlier in the summer, it appeared that the Defence Forces will begin to train the conscripts in the units of immediate readiness from next year.
The units can be used for military operations already during military training, if necessary.
Pamela Tola got the giant compensation for the mold house
Actress Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough fight over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of a two-storey separate house had been €330,000.
After the sale, however, the house revealed a serious moisture problem that caused a microbial growth that was dangerous to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in a condition for demolition in 2014.
The sales price had dropped to 132,000 euros, so the financial losses to Tola and Waroma amounted to as much as 198 000 euros.
The couple took the case to court and there demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case at both the District Court and the Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal ruled on Wednesday.
It upheld the District Court's ruling ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma a price reduction of €150,000.
In addition, the seller has to pay a total of 47 344 euros for the couple's trial and settlement costs.
The right moderated the price reduction slightly, because the buyers had already known some of the need to repair the dwelling at the time of the home sale.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the building defects that appeared were essentially more serious than what had been presented.
Tola was looking for a home in good condition
Tola said in the Court of Appeal that the couple had specifically looked for a home in good condition because they didn't want to go to repairs.
He had been given the impression that the building was renovated and in good condition and that there was no harm in the elements mentioned in the fitness check report.
The fitness inspection report mentioned ventilation as risks and defects, and the fact that the management of rain and melting waters running along the rock surface is not sufficient.
However, the discussions did not reveal that it was an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma were left under the impression that rainwater from the rock should perhaps be controlled slightly in a few years.
The deal was made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became apparent that the moisture problems in the dwelling were much more serious than expected.
The inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 revealed microbe growths that, according to witnesses, were caused by both the rainwaters of the rock and the capillaryly raised ground humidity.
On the west side of the house, the inspector estimated that the air contaminated by microbes could also enter the interior via the porch.
Healthy-risk mold or yeast above limit values were found in brush samples in the housekeeping room, basement staircase, living room window isolation and basement washroom.
The terraces were built without permission
The court also argued whether the apartment had been extended in violation of the building permit.
The court ruled that Tola and Waroma were not aware of Espoo City's decision to change the dwelling against the permit before the sale.
For example, the terraces were built, even though there were no proper permits yet.
But home problems were a key issue in court.
According to the Court of Appeal, on the basis of information obtained from the seller before the sale, the buyers could assume that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for extensive repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma felt there was no particular reason for the Court of Appeal to carry out a larger inspection than usual.
Buyers have not neglected their reporting duty, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Creepy archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to have children for Nazis - also Finns in the register
Journalist Christopher Andersson writes in a recent article by Dagens Nyheter, how the National Archives in Maryland in the United States have recorded documents about a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but they are also American, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian, 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to be Nazi brides.
The documents and registration cards come from a race agency in Nazi Germany.
The Race Agency served under SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true even more for women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, women were subjected to gynaecological studies to investigate the matter.
The race agency investigated women's backgrounds, among other things, by studying church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and give the race agency handwritten biographies and good recommendations from close friends.
The race agency wanted guarantees that women were "loves with children", "sparing", and "good National Socialists" who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as SS men's brides.
The story does not say what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created a state-supported programme known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program provided that every SS man should have four children, either in or outside the marriage.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the programme was not very actively promoted, according to the United States Holocaust Museum website.
Instead, Nazi demographic policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged getting married by offering loans and supported having children.
The German mother's Cross of Honor was granted to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum's website states.
Petäjä-Sire's sixth, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third in the first race of Finnjollie's day in the Rio Olympic Games, but remained the top of the whole team in the second race of the day.
Nirkko rose to eighth in the overall situation after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to 14th.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren fought at the departures of RS:X class 17 and three.
Petäjä-Siren is sixth in the overall situation.
In the 470-class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren were left in 23 at the start of the day.
In the overall situation, the Lindgrens are ranked 19.
Jari Sillanpää's Satulinna was recorded in a couple of hours' sleep: "I was so hungover"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of the favourite Finnish artists for over 20 years.
Sillanpää, who has reached the top of the cruise ship's bar as the 1995 tango king, the best-selling solo artist in Finland, and the star of dance platforms and festivals, is still able to pork, and he is currently in a frantic lift.
The book Jari Sillanpää, written by Mari Koppinen, about the life of the favourite singer, was published today on Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää tells about his life and career in both good and bad.
Sillanpää's career rose to total praise as he won the tango king's crown in the Seinäjoki Tango market in 1995.
In the competition Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already planned some different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango song for Sillanpää at the man's request, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different shape.
Satulinna was one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and after just a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so hungover!
Sillanpää remembers in the book.
You wouldn't immediately guess from recording a song that became a huge hit that it was sung in a hangover.
Even though I wasn't physically at my best, the mark was still good.
I learned that you don't have to insist on being perfect and top-notch all the time.
The second incident related to the man's most popular songs, which the book describes, happened almost 20 years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his then partner, and the case eventually ended up in the texts of "You Earn Gold" that were published as a single in 2014.
The book says that the songs ordered from Saara Törmössä were not as Sillanpää would have liked.
Sillanpää had imagined he was making a record that tells a true story about his own life, but the words of the song about the divorce were not true, but were written on the basis of a 7-day news report.
In the newspaper's news, Jari and his ex-lover broke up because of Jari's excessive partying and drinking, but Jari said it was a total nonsense and wasn't true.
According to the book, Jari was furious with the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and that's good.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52 per cent of voters were in favour of the resignation and 48 per cent would have stayed in the Union, even though polls during the voting week predict the opposite result.
Britain's economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous about staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flaged for divorce, even though a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme of the U.S. former president Bill Clinton's recent election campaign, "It's the economy, stupid" flew into a wreck in Britain's Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic curly language
The Centre for Macroeconomics, in its latest monthly survey, is looking for answers from the professional community to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economists were not listened to, because this time voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation of economists for the loss of economic status is that people don't understand the economy.
Many still have the illusion that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people working, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's off the right Brit.
Many also have the impression that a drop in the value of the currency would be a good thing, as it promotes the export industry.
According to the Economists, voters did not believe the economic arguments, because the consensus of economists did not come up sufficiently.
The BBC's level playing field, which gave only a couple of percent of economists in favour of the EU's difference, gave them the same space as the overwhelming majority.
The anti-EU press was not interested to tell what the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other powerful economic combinations about the consequences of the separation felt.
Those distant letter combinations spoke facelessly about economic growth, trade relations, sovereign debt and currency.
And if the economists' messages were both listened to and understood, they were ignored, because economists represent an elite with whom voters feel they have no common interests.
The academics in big cities, such as economists, would have stayed in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas, the message did not work.
Immigration is also an economy
The overwhelming profit motive of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
The immigrant will take your job, the immigrant will jam your hospital, the immigrant will take advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
There are foreign employees in every cafe.
How many more jobs would the Britons have if they left?
You can see immigrants in the waiting room of every health centre.
How much easier would it be for Britain to get medical appointments if they didn't exist?
Every school has immigrant children, too.
How much easier would it be for the children of a real Brit to get a place to go to school if they were to be rid of them?
There are foreigners living in every municipality.
How much more space would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond to them, and if they did, their answers did not get visibility.
Economists failed to explain that the immigrants have more jobs, fewer health centre queues and more money for education and social security.
Migrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to British public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen real estate fund prepared for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, Aberdeen prepared for Brexit in time by drawing up plans A and B.
A few weeks before the vote, in case the result was left, the plan B, the victory of the camp supporting the EU break-up, began to be prepared more closely.
The concern was that investors would begin to withdraw their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large liquid assets, but they could be needed now.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd, we had 25 per cent of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says about Aberdeen's only open daily real estate fund, which was the subject of the news.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20 per cent.
At the time, the fund was worth £3.5 billion.
The total value of the company's funds is about £20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all the open real estate funds in Britain.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was 10 per cent or even below.
So the real estate funds prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
The funds closed the deal
When the camp that supported the EU split won, Europe went crazy.
However, the less than two weeks after the vote in the real estate market were quite calm, says Vanhanen.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, who estimated that Brexit could be a big risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trade.
Together, they robbed the situation and brought the matter to the headlines of the Financial Times and BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball began to spin, and the fund after fund had to close its doors.
Aberdeen's situation was good because of the cash collected, but it also eventually had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually close the deal, but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, investors were given time, he said, to consider whether the money should now be thrown out in a panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it won't pay because it would cost you.
It calmed the situation, and most of them withdrew the announcement.
Since then it has been quite steady, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, says Vanhanen.
He points out that, for example, there has been no such turmoil in Aberdeen's Continental European funds.
However, there were a lot of inquiries.
Excessive attention to real estate funds
Vanhanen said the closures of real estate funds received excessive attention.
The open funds that were affected by the closures dominate about four per cent of Britain's real estate.
Aberdeen's closure lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties out of 80 of its London properties.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned their investors this week that it might keep its funds closed to the side of 2017.
At the moment there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been torn downwards, but the situation does not look more "hopeful" to Aberdeen.
The biggest questions now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even created new opportunities for some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The price of pound and dollar is lowest in 30 years, and there is a 15 percent discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property for up to 30 per cent cheaper.
There are many willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit's activities in the London real estate market
At two o'clock in the morning, things didn't look so good yet.
But at four o'clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, who is responsible for real estate investments at Aberdeen Asset Management, in the British real estate fund, woke up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the power word.
I realized that this is now going to plan B," Vanhanen says in his other home in Helsinki.
He immediately headed to work.
London City was already completely alive, despite the morning.
The TV screens that were normally set to be silent at the office were squealing the news, and the normally loud people were completely silent to listen as Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell about his resignation.
When the market opened, the screen terminals flashed just red.
It was one of those mornings you never thought you'd be alive, says Vanhanen.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain's largest real estate funds, finished two real estate deals the day after the Brexit vote, the Midsummer.
The atmosphere was confused.
However, the company was well prepared for the option, which is why the situation was kind of calm, says Vanhanen.
The Brexit vote started a correction
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, Britain's leadership went into change.
The market began to anticipate drastic falls in the real estate market in Britain and London in particular.
The London office premises were expected to have losses of up to 20 percent in the coming years.
Soon a group of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the wet has subsided, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it doesn't show up on Vanhanen's face, who spent his last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
He thinks it is far too early to say much about Brexit.
So much remains open: how the separation will happen and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
First information on the development of the London real estate market has already been received.
CBRE's information on price developments covers about a third of the market.
According to them, all London real estate prices fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City office buildings, the minus was 6.1 per cent, says Vanhanen.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and there have been worse figures in only five months, says Vanhanen.
All the equally large drops hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting, too, because Brexit was very quickly compared to Lehman's fall and the global economic crisis that began in the U.S. real estate market.
Vanhanen thinks the comparison is not quite apt, because this is a home-grown crisis in Britain.
The atmosphere is different, too.
The real estate market has not now seen panic sales like that, but the willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
There is also financial support as usual.
The repair movement could have been ahead of us anyway
In fact, the price adjustment is not a miracle to him - it could have been there even without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen's estimate, the real estate prices of London and other top cities in the world have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City, and especially the offices, are overpriced, says Vanhanen.
So the drop started really high.
London's prices have tightened up for four reasons, Vanhanen's list.
Britain's economy has grown strongly, as has London's population.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership that is globalised, says Vanhanen.
New players have emerged from the Middle East and Asia, and more institutions and even private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London, as a known city, is an easy target.
In addition, prices have been fuelled by low interest rates, which has forced pension companies, for example, to seek returns on new targets.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although Vanhanen said the leverage has been used now clearly less than during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
Decentralize, decentralize
In London, the price increase was levelled out last summer, says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen also began to lighten its holdings in London, and was a net seller last year.
There was some kind of change to be expected, and here it is.
So, what's the next step?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says Vanhanen.
He does not dare to estimate much of the future, but says that there is hardly going to be any peaks.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a downward or steady process ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen several moves up and down, since he has been in real estate since 1988.
And he's still an optimist, who thinks they can work through the pits.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you've invested in one market, you're too much of a victim.
If you have decentralised, the risks are also decentralised, says Vanhanen.
S Group begins to register shop information more closely
Soon the S Group will know what you're eating, as the trading group said today it will begin to collect more accurate information about the purchases of its regular customers.
So far, once the information has been gathered about the total amount of the receipt, the group will begin in early May to harass it also about the products purchased.
The S Group follows Kesko here, because the information on the goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to K-Plus Oy's CEO, Ismo Riitala, the feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the customer's consent and is used for marketing on a licensed basis.
The most effective channel is email.
Quite a few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala says to Taloussanom.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to the change in registration of the S Group.
Kesko already classes its regulars according to grocery shopping to ten groups.
The classification is updated monthly.
Stock customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The information is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase information is collected only from K Group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not give up their information.
Lidl Finland does not have a customer loyalty programme and there is no such programme planned for the time being.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own Onesbonus customer loyalty programme, which can be associated with in Valtitalo, Siwo and Euromarkets.
At the moment, we do not collect information about product or product group levels, we stick to the total amount of the receipt.
So we know which store the purchases were made and on what day and the customer's receipt total.
We have not gone to the level of the K-Group or the S-Group, says commercial director Anu Ora.
According to him, the loyalty programme will be reformed in the future, but Lähikauppa will report on the matter later.
However, Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
Initially, an experiment
So far, SOK's customer ownership and customer register has been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal and address information, the basic information has included occupation, education, form of living, the years of birth of children and previous personal data.
The persons belonging to the same economy and their role have also been registered.
The date and time of the purchase, the place, the total amount of the purchases and the method of payment have been recorded from the S-Etucard purchase.
In addition, information from S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase information will be stored in Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prismos, Kodin Terras and ABC chains, the data is currently recorded at product group level.
For a long time, customers have been hoping to be more focused on marketing, says Marjaana Saarikoski, head of customer ownership and partner operations at SOK.
The S Group says it will inform its customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data will be stored in the cashiers anyway, whether they want it or not.
The willing person can check their stored information on the S Group website.
For example, the cashiers cannot access the information, says Saarikoski.
Video: Heila puppy is Customs' newest dog confirmation - the puppy will be the first explosive dog
Black Labrador retriever's puppy vigorously sniffs five similar boxes lined up in the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long before it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog to play it with its favourite toy.
The box heila sat next to revealed a jar of shell casings for the powder gas.
Gunpowder gas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, the owner of the dog Heila.
Security situation and main reasons for e-commerce
Heila is Customs' first dog specialising in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossings and ports if necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila's main place of work, because the international security situation has changed as a result of serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused action in Customs, and since the attacks, surveillance has been strengthened, says Customs Chief Inspector-General Mikko Grönberg.
The second main reason for training a gun and explosive dog for Customs tasks is postal deliveries via Helsinki Airport.
As a result of the growing internet deal, up to 40 million postal items pass through the airport every year, including arms supplies and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made about 300 findings related to weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives and their precursors from online shopping, passenger plane baggage and air cargo at Helsinki Airport.
Heila will work across Helsinki Airport.
It will investigate registered luggage and mail.
In the future, it will be a big benefit in ports when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on Heila's performance, Customs will assess whether more gun and explosive dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is hopeful about the idea.
School at Kirkkonummi
Heila puppy training is coordinated by Customs dog school in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also visits police and Defence Forces experts to train with Heila.
The police have strong experience in dog training and the Defence Forces has expertise in explosives.
Together with other authorities, Customs decides what smells Heila is taught to recognise.
Heila is always further trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Tull's six drug dogs, as well as the cash and drug dog Massi.
Labrador retriever Heila has been selected from a litter of ten puppies.
The selection criteria for the dog chosen for the airport include briskness and hunting instinct, as well as calmness, because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human streams.
Heila, who lives at Suntio's home, is a close co-worker for the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can't go anywhere without Heila at home, Suntio laughs.
The subtle orders go to Heila for a one-time deal.
The Ilta-Sanomie cameraman loses the camera mic cover to a fast dog, but Heila returns the soft-toy cover immediately from the "move" order.
Hard competition for work dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, the next in October, to assess whether the training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heila can be seen working at Helsinki Airport next year, if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come and iron a dog wearing a work vest, says Suntio.
The cost of one work dog is about 60,000-70,000 euros a year for Customs.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to their owners.
The working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active contributions last from only 10 minutes to a couple of hours.
The owner of the work dogs is a tough competition in Customs.
About 20-30 Customs employees applied to own Heila.
The luck hit Suntio, who has never had a work dog before, but he has years of experience in dogs and surveillance tasks in Customs.
Mini-state got its first Olympic medal - the people get a day off
The Olympic gold of Fiji with less than a million inhabitants in rugby is valued so high in the country that the government has decreed August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the country's broadcaster, Fiji's government confirmed the matter after the championship was over.
The day off is taken the day after the team's return home.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
Fiji's rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian says the country followed the final in Suva, the capital, where a screen had been set up for the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game linked our multicultural community.
Even in Chinese restaurants the game was watched, I heard them encouraging, said Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru to the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - a Finnish lifter fainted after a wild performance
The weight lifter Milko Tokola managed his last attempt for 175 kilos after a tough fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature for a lifter.
During or immediately after heavy liftings, he has passed out many times.
No one has really been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola scored 175 kilos of push and 145 kilos of pull.
His combined result was 320 kilos.
Tokola tried to get his last push 175 kilos, as did one.
In the third attempt, the weights rose with a frantic roar.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury approved the lift.
The Finnish lifter's joy was accompanied by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired Estonian attacker Prosan - Veikkausliika - Ilta-Sanomat
Rovaniemi Ball Society, who plays in the Men's Football League, has concluded a long-term contract with Estonian attacker Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a leading player in our team with power and a small threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi.
We went through over 50 players from around the world with more than ten players.
Gradually, Prosa began to stand out as a good option, as RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a press release.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Tallinna Flora, where she scored 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played in the Estonian national team.
Prosa is due to be with RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemiers meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new attacker when last season's goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
The Brave Modern Family Star shones again: Teenager Star shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who has become a good friend of the Modern Family comedy series Alex Dunphy, is once again exasperating by showing off her pompous body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
Shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also his ass.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing her style and behaviour considerably more courageous.
The star has posed in pictures published in social media with very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very tight outfits.
Winter, who is on the threshold of adulthood, has also recently published several pictures of herself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can see it here.
Earlier this summer Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its image so radically.
At that time, the founder and CEO of PowerwomanTV, Amy Palmer, suspected Winter was experiencing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television almost his whole life and has grown up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more you look at the surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series when she was only 11 years old.
The actor has resented some of her long-term fans with her image change.
It's not hard to guess where she will be in ten years, when the downhill is already so hard, says one woman on Winter Instagram.
Some of the women's fans, on the other hand, defend the actor and advise them not to care about criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what people say.
You're an inspiration to many women, a young woman is gloating.
Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted to the aurora: In the autumn it is possible to see a fairy-tale mirror aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to start the aurora trips already in early autumn, Visit Finland says in a press release.
The main destinations of the Japanese aurora tourism are Inari and Levi.
Northern lights are the assets of our winter travel, and they are strongly associated with heart winter and snowy landscapes.
There is a high demand for winter aurora trips in Lapland, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the aurora season starts early in the autumn and goes far into the spring.
In the autumn it is possible to see the so-called "mirror aurora", where the lake surface reflects the aurora, making the vision double-folded, says Visit Finland's Acting Marketing Manager Anne Lind.
The main target group of Visit Finland's aurora campaign is the wealthy 25-35-year-olds, Japanese women living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising, for example.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and Turku and Tokyo universities, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive land image among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would long for clearer unique attractions from Finland, and this is where the aurora has enormous potential, according to Lind.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists in Finland have grown clearly more than other Nordic countries.
Last year they spent more than twice as much in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interesting for Finnish tourism as a target group because they spent over 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, says Lind.
Britain had to settle for silver in rugby-7 when Fiji's champion team won gold
The impressive success of the seven-player rugby race in Great Britain was devastatingly broken when Fiji won it in the finals played at Rio's Deodoro Stadium on Thursday between 43 and 7.
Fiji gave a master's lesson in ball handling, transfers, side diversions, support game, running lines and brutal strength, winning gold - if the country had the first Olympic medal in all its history.
The defeat meant silver, which was a little bit more comfort for Britain, because it was the third silver in the country on the same day, and they can be proud of their success in the first rugby-7 tournament in the Olympic Games, where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The hard win from the South African Boxes in 7-5 semifinals earlier in the same day could have had a negative effect on the team in the finals.
Despite this, Fiji's team in this form would have won the Brits, even if the 15-person team had been in full power.
The fact that at least one British gets a gold medal on his neck tomorrow may bring comfort to Britain: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, former English rugby-7 coach from Wimbledon.
It has been quite an experience for Britain.
Eight years ago they lost all the games in Ryan's training at Adelaide Sevens.
In Rio, they lost only one game.
Loss hurts, but progress is startling.
Fiji started out excellently and presented her tackle skills to the UK for fun.
It looked like Captain Tom Mitchell and his team ran into a bunch of moving buses, and world champions took the lead 5-0 when Osea Kolisau made a dive into the corner.
When the clock was four minutes away, Jerry Tuwai scored another goal on the right side of the goal kick.
Situation 12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's magnificent tackle prevented the rugged Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third goal, but that didn't slow Fiji down for long.
After seven minutes of play, Jasa Veremalua scored in the right corner, after which the UK was 17-0 down.
Nakarawa scored a second goal for a further start, with more than a minute left for the first half of the game.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou plunged through the UK team's more powerless tackles and hit the finish line.
After the goal kick, the opening period ended with 29-0.
It seemed that Fijians were born to play seven-player rugby, while the Britons are still in the role of an apprentice.
Which is largely true.
The UK made large-scale changes at half time and managed to hold off Fijians for four whole minutes, which was a good performance compared to the first half, until Joshua Tuisova scored a goal thanks to the Fijian team game.
Dan Norton managed to narrow the score to 36-7 by scoring a goal for the UK in the left corner, but the game had long since been lost to the South Sea archipelago, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
Fiji's pure joyous attitude was hard not to admire.
Mata Viliame made the final touch on Fijian cake by scoring a goal in the final moments.
The whistle rang, Fijians embraced each other, and the Britons fell on the field, completely crushed.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had won Japan's semi-finals between 20 and 5 and Great Britain had simmered past South Africa in a tight semi-final, where the balance was solved by the British goal kick.
Kyle Brown took the South African Boxes to the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with his dazzling footwork and crashed under the goalposts in the second half.
Marcus Watson, the brother of England's 15-player rugby team, Anthony Watson, sealed the victory and finally a silver medal.
The coach's fight against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to row gold
The more emotional the gold in these games could not be.
From the first draft to the last Helen Glover and Heather Stanning rowed 220 triumphant strokes to history and found additional meaning for their golden moment in Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though they were two in the oars, the third voice echoed in the boat was coach Robin Williams, who encouraged them to their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's duo, making them the first women in the history of British sport to achieve a similar achievement.
Their superiority was beyond dispute, their victory was already 39rd in a row and once again record.
What we see, two brilliant athletes connecting on the surface like swans to age, does not fully reflect the nature of success.
Behind every rowing gold there are a large number of helpful hands, each of which has contributed to the two to the achievement, but the most important of the assistants is the coach who diagnosed the cancer 30 months ago and then didn't know if he would see the day.
According to Williams, the situation was tight at the time.
"I had bladder cancer, and the tumor could be cut off.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
and the situation would have been pretty bad.
It changes a bit the way you think."
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky that Williams was able to begin his treatment outside the season of the sport in the beginning of 2014, when the interruption caused as little harm as possible, if you can say so in circumstances such as this.
"I needed money, so I had to heal quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around section 6, 9 and 15 metres at a time when they said a few steps were enough.
That's how it starts.
Rowing in itself is already a journey, but this made it a bit bigger."
Immediately after the victory, the duo's thoughts were in Williams, who had spent a nervous morning talking a little more than normal in an attempt to overcome his own unrest.
British Royal Artillery Regiment Captain Stanning, who had a tour of Afghanistan behind him, says: "I've been feeling like a wreck this week, which is perhaps a bit extreme, but it means so much."
"It just tells how much this means to me and how much we have worked together with Helen and Robin.
For the last three years, Helen's and Robin's cashiers have been fantastic.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so a huge thank you to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have hoped for a better person to train with, or a better coach."
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any competition in the last five years.
The duo has found an overwhelming rhythm to which their rivals have failed to match.
Even at the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Denmark duo began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had extra resources.
"We were very close in the moment.
Helen said, "Stay with me, stay with me."
It is very important not to drift off the route."
"We managed to leave well, and at the same time we didn't try to do anything amazing.
We didn't seek the heavens today, we just wanted to make a good rowing and win the race we did."
The two think for a year before deciding their future.
Glover celebrates his wedding next month with Steve Backshall, who is familiar with TV nature programmes
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last race.
It would have brought too much pressure."
"After London it took about six months before I realized I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
This time it took about four minutes to realize.
This feels so much better," he says.
Iceland will change the government of Panama leaks
Iceland will organise early parliamentary elections in October, which the protesters infuriated by the Panama data leaks demanded already in the spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed several Icelandic politicians to have evaded taxes using tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but that was not enough for the protesters.
His successor Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson promised then to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
Election Day has now been decided on October 29th.
Analysts say it's hard to predict how much the people's rage last spring will affect the result of the autumn election.
In June's presidential elections, criticalness towards those in power was clearly evident, and Gudni Johannesson, who had been nominated from outside politics, was elected president.
Trump said he was being sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of ISIS
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump withdrew his latest tumults.
He said he was being sarcastic when he claimed that sitting President Barack Obama was the founder of the terrorist organisation Isis and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was also involved in setting up the organisation.
The Democratic Party was furious about the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
You should never let anyone who can sink down that low as chief of the army, Clinton tweeted.
In the south of France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of the Muslim-like burkini bathing suit on the beaches, for example, according to the British newspaper Guardian.
A decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that it is forbidden to go to the beaches and swim for anyone who has no good manners and a bathing suit that respects secularism.
The decision also states that swimsuits, which extantly express religious ties, can increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice, when a 31-year-old man drove to a crowd celebrating the French National Day.
At the end of July, two men connected to the extremist organization Isis attacked a church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
The quality of the bathing waters in the Oulu region passed through the sieve - At Pyykösjärvi, the sea of blue algae
Water samples taken from official beaches in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Blue algae opacity has been observed only on the shore of Lake Pyykösjärvi.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environmental Action took water samples from nine EU beaches in the Oulu region and 30 other public beaches.
With the exception of the shore of Meriniemi, the levels of E. coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in all bathing areas were below the action limits laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E. coli and enterococci concentrations in the sea-going beach were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial levels had fallen below the action limit.
The blue algae opacity found on the shore of Lake Pyykösjärvi does not yet make the water unfit for swimming, but under favourable conditions the situation can quickly turn into a blue algae bloom, resulting in blue-green algae mass forming on the surface of the water.
The environmental action will monitor the situation with more frequent inspections.
If the blue algae opacity turns into a blue algae flower, it will also be announced separately on the beach's notice board.
Check the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK's Hakkarainen forest gift reduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside
The forest gift deduction is one tax change in the Ministry of Finance's budget proposal for next year.
A tax deduction is proposed to the Income Tax Act, which would be granted on the basis of a gift tax on the generation change of forest holdings.
In the Ministry of Finance's proposal, the forest gift reduction has four goals: to promote generational changes in forest holdings, to rejuvenate forest owners' age structure, to increase forest space size and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry's goal is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would make a deduction from the clean capital income of forestry.
The idea of making such a tool to promote generational changes in forest holdings is a good one, comments Juha Hakkarainen, Director of Forests of the Federation of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, Hakkarainen finds criticism in the tax change proposal.
A forest gift deduction is proposed for the forest owner's pure capital income.
It is a capital income from which all other deductions have been deducted.
MTK and Hakkarainen felt that the tax deduction would be more effective if the deduction could be made directly from the wood's sales income.
VM's proposal starts from the fact that by making a deduction from the clean capital income of forestry, it will prevent a loss of the forest's capital income that would be deducted from other taxes.
Such a person would receive tax benefits even if he did not sell wood.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner is unable to understand it, says Hakkarainen.
In addition, he said the model only applies to a small number of forest owners.
The tax deduction limit, which is linked to the forest's yield value, is 40,000 euros in the proposal.
It's too high in Hakkarainen's mind.
As such, he said, it will cut 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners out of the deduction.
The model would have an effect on about 10 per cent of forest owners, he says.
The VM considers that the border guarantees the goal of increasing the size of the farm.
According to Hakkarainen, forest gift reduction has taken decades in forest policy.
It is based on the aging of forest owners.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is now over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful hailstorm surprised the drivers in Himanga - two cars derailed into a ditch and ran into each other
A special chase took place on Friday morning in Himanga, Kalajoki.
According to the rescue department, two cars in a row were derailed in a ditch, after which the one in the rear crashed ahead of him.
According to Harri Pyhtää, the on-call fire master, the ditch is suspected to have been caused by a heavy hailstorm.
There were two people in the car behind, both of whom were taken to hospital for treatment.
There is no more accurate information about their injuries.
The driver of the car that was driving ahead was not injured.
The accident happened on highway 8 from Himanga a few kilometres to Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help to develop cancer treatments that are more effective than before.
The findings of Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska's research team show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases the cancer's malignancy.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to match normal soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer treatments may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells.
The results of the study have been published on 4 August in the prestigious journal Nature Communications in the field of cellular biology.
Muhos family home killing continues at court, the prosecutor demands a murder sentence also for another person
Muhos' family home killing continues at court for both sentenced persons.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for a family home killing in Muhos.
One of them received 8 years for, for example, killing and aggravated robbery as a young person.
The sentence of another is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The sentenced person was also sentenced for gross endangerment of road safety as a young person and for driving a vehicle without a right as a young person.
The District Court's verdict was appealed by the prosecutor, the plaintiffs and the man who received the harsher sentence.
The prosecutor demands a lesser sentence for a young person's murder to be sentenced to 12 years in prison.
They were in full understanding at the time of the act
According to District Court, 17-year-old young men killed a man who worked as a child welfare supervisor in a schoolhouse in July last year.
According to the grounds for the sentence, a 17-year-old sentenced to murder attacked a director sitting from behind on the sofa in the living room.
The director had let go of the grip and led the young person to his room, when one of the young people hit him with a vacuum cleaner tube.
The director was also strangled with leadership, hit and kicked in the head.
According to a state of mind study, both sentenced persons were fully understood at the time of the act.
According to the court, young people had planned an escape from the family home, at least since the previous day.
Ice shark is the longest-lived vertebrate in the world, increasing only at 156
The longest living vertebrate in the world has been confirmed by an ice shark, a study published in Science magazine.
In the northern Atlantic, such as Greenland, an ice shark, or Holker, can live to be up to 400 years old.
The female does not grow until the age of 156.
The ice shark's life span is increased by the fact that it grows only one centimetre a year.
Only one species of clam is known to live longer than ice sharks.
The researchers discovered the age with radiocarbon dating.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks contained radioactive residues.
Based on these, researchers were able to estimate the shark's age.
The elder's age was estimated to be 392 years - though the throwing in one direction or another could be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as a wise economy - Kansan Uutiset
Donald Trump's America doesn't need the rest of the world.
As much as a third of the state's total tax revenue would not be paid if Donald Trump's move to corporate tax was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, especially with tax breaks that benefit the richest.
Trump described his tax programme as revolutionary when presenting it in Detroit on Monday.
The company tax would fall from 35 per cent to 15 per cent.
There would be a huge amount left uncollected, $1,000 billion a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39.6%, 33 after Trump's discount.
The inheritance tax would be abolished altogether.
Trump blamed the state for over-regulation of the economy and for bankrupting small businesses.
The agreed environmental standards of haste must be re-established and energy regulation must be dismantled.
Barack Obama's healthcare reform needs to be re-examined.
We need to appoint "experts instead of bureaucrats" to the administration.
According to Trump, the "stupid" trade policy is one of the main causes of the problems in the United States.
Free trade agreements would be suspended.
A 45 per cent penalty tax and 35 per cent penalty tax would be imposed on imports from China.
We offer a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our creed, Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need the rest of the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes will unite cities, American ships will control the seas, American steel will lift new skyscrapers across the country.
Unlike his habits, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by the assistants, even though it was interrupted 14 times by well-organised protests.
Economists - including those close to Republicans - see Trump's programme lead the United States to a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own programme early on Friday, Finnish time.
Attack wave from the past - Kansan Uutiset
The sea is frantic, but a real tidal wave strikes in the middle of Madrid's street chatter - reckoning with the past can begin.
That sums up the essence of Pedro Almodóvar's new story.
Almodovar's previous steering work The Travel Lovers (2013) was a fun little satirical comedy, followed by Iho, where I live at the top of a Spanish career (2011).
Julieta (2016) is placed somewhere between the two works.
It is a conventionally serene love, relationship and family drama centred on a mother-daughter relationship.
The story is simple and is widely seen as a long flashback.
Life seems to be good for a middle-aged name character (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a random encounter, a new man friend (Dario Grandinetti) will be amazed until the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta times the stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
He begins with the time before his daughter was born, the moments when he met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, comes to the second leading woman, who is a TV star from The Time Between Snacks (2013-2014).
Julieta's aging has been handled in a way that can be considered a slob, but I would say it's time for a quick and verbal wipe.
Often the Almodóvar films have a fair distance from such a characteristic flashyness, up to the level of humor, in Julieta.
It is a flatly played, discreet, place with good music in some places, and a rather sad film that has the ingredients for elephantism.
Instead, the visual saturation that is typical for the Spanish director is still in place and so that it slowly begins to stick in the eye more as a pure technicality than as a functional dramatic effect.
The film's characters are affected by illness, death or other sudden losses, but the surface remains as fine.
This is especially true for dressing: in the case of a name person, the costumes change from one scene to another, and the same applies to spectacular earrings.
Almodóvar is accurate in these matters, but the main thing, the tunes of the scene, is not getting any better.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and slightly breathless.
Almodóvar has produced the manuscript based on three novels by Canadian Alice Munro, awarded with the Nobel Prize in 2013.
Novellit has been published in Karkulainen: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, and the result is a bit evenly written literary filming.
The ingredients would have been emotionally unmatched even with a much bigger drama, so much big things - especially gnawing guilt - are dealt with in the film's theology.
Directory and script: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three novels by Alice Munro.
lead: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The premiere of the film is 12.8.
The government is trying an election trick - Kansan Uutiset
There will be no new cuts, saying ministers, so that the Finns don't collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring will be done a lot.
There will be no new cuts.
The already decided savings of $4 billion are enough.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (cooked) say under the budget line.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM's proposal, because the cuts in social security were decided already in the spring's frame room.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits tied to the national pension index are cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment benefit will be reduced from 500 days to 400 days.
Training cuts continue.
Municipal elections haunt
Why are ministers so emphatic about the fact that there will be no new cuts on top of them?
Because next year is an election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and are the most important thermometer of the parliamentary term, not the polls.
It has been seen before that the municipal election result that takes government parties in different directions will spoil the government's atmosphere for a long time.
However, Gallup reports that the government party's base Finns expect a snout, even though the result of its previous elections was modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary election.
The Finns Party received 752 new delegates four years ago, most of which will be realised next spring in the right-wing government.
The lifeline of the government of the three roughly equal parties depends on the basic Finns' courage.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of the party's voters had enough of government politics already during the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's visitation have also surfaced.
First of all, the "no new cuts" rhetoric obscures the fact that next year they will be done violently and the second is trying to soften the attack waiting for the Finns.
Major cuts in 2018?
In a year, everything will probably be different - if Sipilä's government is still standing.
The government has set itself the goal of indebtedness in this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo's budget proposal will take 5.9 billion euros next year, more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government will not be able to follow its own programme: the debt will not be broken or even slowed down.
The other is to stick to the program.
It means new even harder cuts on the old ones in the 2017 budget line.
The budget would be pushed at least close to balance during 2018 and then in the spring the parliamentary elections will accept what will happen.
These measures will not break indebtedness
It is quite clear that the current measures will not break the debt, even though Juha Sipilä is trying to stir up a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäki at the press conference of the budget prove it irrefutablely:
World economy growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. there will be no leverage from the international economy.
Finland's national economy has hardly risen since the collapse in 2008, except temporarily during its recovery policy in the beginning of the 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent in this decade and has been prolonged from an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs €3 billion more a year than in 2008.
With the curves presented by Hetemäki, the government debt that exceeded the 60 per cent limit in 2014 will rise to 70 per cent in the middle of next decade.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment costs about six billion euros, which is practically fully covered by new debt.
This is the understanding of the centre, the National Coalition Party and the Finns Party about what is responsible.
Poll: Many tasks are left to municipalities
Three out of four think it is the municipality's responsibility to organise child day care, youth work and exercise, according to a study by KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people also pass on responsibility to the individual municipality for libraries, culture, adult education centres, building supervision, upper secondary school education and waste management.
The region's most obvious responsibility is regional planning, special health care, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for the mentally disabled.
There is no desire to transfer any of the tasks under the responsibility of the municipalities to the state.
A minor drunk driver ran away from a police officer at the end of the chase
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu ran away from a police patrol in Ilomantsintie on Friday night around 5:30.
The police patrol tried to stop the motorbike without lights, but the young man ran away from the police at a fair speed.
The chase continued to Sonakajanrannantie, from which the motorbike continued to Sorronahontie and to a smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but a police officer with a faster leg ran to catch the fugitive.
The breath test for the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a driver's licence that would justify driving a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, for example, as a gross endangerment of road safety.
A truck with a load of rocks fell into a ditch
A truck in a rock load fell into a ditch in Polvijärvi on Kaavintie on Thursday evening at 9:15 pm.
The truck had drifted to the left in a curved bend out of the road and fell on its side into a ditch.
The rescue department lifted the injured driver out of the crashed truck through the door above, together with rescue helicopter personnel and paramedics.
Lifting the vehicle was left to the car's owner.
Hydraulic oil was drained from the crashed truck, which was sucked into peat by the rescue department.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
The elderly woman disappeared this afternoon in Ilmajoki
The 87-year-old woman has been missing since afternoon in Ilmajoki Lahtinkylä in South Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for a tall, slim and well-rounded woman with white hair that extends under her jaw.
Observations and clues about lost movements are asked to call the hotline of the Ostrobothnia Situation Centre 0295440513.
The ingredients of a major accident in the air - look at the destruction of the photo gallery Parafest
The crash flow that knocked down the tents of Parafest festival caused massive destruction.
The chairman of the Joensuu Parafest association, Arto Pippuri, estimates that the festival will get on its feet financially, and the event can also be organised next year.
Parafest's last performer Kalle Salonen performed in the market at the end of Friday evening.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with performances in the city theatre premises starting at 1 pm.
There is a Parafest exhibition at the art centre Ahjo from 1 pm to 3 pm.
The programme will be organised as planned.
The crash flow is generated in a thunderstorm when rainwater and its weight trigger the descending air flow.
The changes in the shape of the water in the thunder cloud bind the heat, and thus the falling air mass cools and its speed towards the earth accelerates.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that there are several surges in Finland during the summer.
It is difficult to predict the route of the downflows.
The crash flow hit Parafest's back yard at the Joensuu Art Museum on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents fell down, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
Four people were slightly injured in the accident.
Among them was one child, who was slightly injured in further treatment.
Air pollution ages Londoners
According to the study, Londoners' skin ages faster than usual.
The reason for skin aging is air pollution.
The British study is reported by Evening Standard.
British skin care company Caci analysed London's most toxic particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired Londoners is two-and-a-half years older than, say, a fellow who lives in rural areas.
The skin-ageing particulates are a very fine dust pollution that comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to Evening Standard, die almost 9,500 Londoners every year.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac's study found that early aging is a risk, especially for Londoners who walk on their commute near crowded streets.
The residents of London may try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example with different masks, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
The tractor's brakes failed - pushed the man standing in front
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
After he got off the tractor and went in front of it, the tractor's brakes failed and the tractor ran over him.
The man wasn't under it, but the tractor was able to push the man enough to be transported to the central hospital with serious injuries to further investigation.
The tractor did not run any further, because it hit the rocks in the front.
Riento with renewed strength for the coming season
Liiga-Riento, who plays in the Volleyball Championship, starts from better starting points in October than in memory.
The team has been together for almost three weeks.
The common note is found with certainty better than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been gloomy for Rienno.
Jani Säisä, who continues as Rienno's head coach, praises the new team for being enterprising and united.
From the foreign trio, middle fighter Fred Musoni begins his second season in Rienno.
The new face is Murangwa Nelson, aged 23, and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who played in Rwanda's national team, is a 205-inch chipper.
Garchet is correspondingly a passer, a Brazilian with a length of 198 cents.
Through Josba, Kataja and River Boys to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has been playing in almost all of the gym band's World Championships since 2003.
Now Tampere is already in the sixth race, only 2013 was missed after Canada was better at North America's qualifiers.
I worked in Turku and played with women there when I noticed the ad.
The USA was setting up a national team for the gym band.
I got interested, and here we are, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York in the city of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was a year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen was admitted to Joensuu University to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, the sport was not yet played at the SM level like a gym bandy.
The ball was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in Jokipoji in the Finnish Championship series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played the gym band SM series in the university's company during the 1991-92 season, the next three seasons were spent in Josba.
In addition to playing, he coached the club's A-girls to the championship.
Women's Finnish Championship career culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played in women's SM series for 10 seasons, the balance in 169 matches was 51+34=85.
The latest SM season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen were appointed to the national team
Perttu Puska and Enoian-based Tatu Väänänen were elected to the Finnish national team to play in the Czech Brno EFT tournament from 6 to 8 November.
The 25-year-old Perttu Puska, who attacks in Helsinki, has played six men's land matches before this, in which he has accumulated a total of 9+4=13 power points.
The 32-year-old champion of Swiss Wiler-Ersigen, Tatu Väänänen, has recovered from the thigh problem and is part of the national team's standard equipment with 117 national matches experience.
In the national team, Mika Kohonen, who was last seen in Finland's shirt at last December's World Championship, was also named as a senior player for the brothers in Seinäjoki.
Petri Kettunen, from Kontiolahti, is the main coach for the Salibandy national team.
Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM gold missing from the prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is closing as a beach volley player, at least temporarily after the current season.
Beach volley's Finnish championships will be decided at Kouvola Sports Park this weekend.
During three days, the medals are played in a series of both adults and young people.
In cooperation with Kouvola's Volleyball players and the Finnish Volleyball Association, the Finnish Championship finals will qualify for the top six pairs of the rankings in each series.
The local color in the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, who has been a member of the Finnish beach volley for several years.
Hasu, who now lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to playing in front of a familiar audience.
Hopefully, as many as possible will be able to make it to the stands this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena at the baseball stadium.
I haven't played in adult leagues very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in finals in the neighborhood," Hasu says.
The Kouvola region set fire to Hasu's spark in sport and gave a good lunch for a great hobby.
There are good memories of childhood in mind.
I started volleyball when I was 9 years old at Elimäki's NMKY girls' E-girls.
The top part is too big a jersey, knee pads spinning around the ankles and huge aces and choreographies after the point, says Hasu.
In a small town, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
Everyone's families were strongly involved - the teammate's father coached us and our mother was the club's chairman for a long time.
Essi Hasuille beach volley was already a natural choice for indoor volleyball in junior days.
The beach of Kärälammi has been playing a bit since the 1990s.
The activity has always been active in the visitors.
I also went to see the Junior Championships sectionals myself, thinking that one day I would be there to play.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu, along with Annina Parkkinen, who is a beater, will play in the finals of the SM.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked duo in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We still lack the SM gold in the trophy cabinet, Hasu throws mysteriously.
The weekend's performance in Kouvola may be the last for Hasu in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges await civilian work.
Yes, the international career will be over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, at least temporarily, the toe slippers will be put on the nail, Hasu is planning.
The crash flow knocked over tents at a disabled event in Joensuu, the disaster was near
The crash flow knocked down three tents at the Parafest festival of disabled people in Joensuu.

According to Karjalainen, the tents had a total of about 200 persons.
There was a show going on in one bigger tent.
Two tents were smaller.
The accident happened on Friday at 5 p.m.
Karjalainen's on-call fire master Markus Viitaniemi tells the newspaper that the situation had the ingredients for the disaster.
According to the newspaper, the continuation of the event is at stake.

Solomon's Koli bravely became an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as an entrepreneur means taking risks, sweat and energy.
A young farmer, Solomon's Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future also in rural areas.
Soon two years ago, Koli, together with his younger brother Valtteri Koli, began to continue their home farm.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers through his own experience.
Starting out as a rural entrepreneur meant borrowing debt and increasing the size of the farm, so that the bread could come from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always been happy with the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur myself, I've put everything in the game.
If you start something, I think it should be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we set out to build a garden barn, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
But I was really brave enough to go along with the project, and I have been fully involved in it, says Solomon Koli, adding that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in producing pure Finnish food and that everything will turn out well.
The goal of Salomon Koli, who grows meat cattle, is to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has produced results, since Solomon's Koli has been selected as the top ten in the competition of the young food producer of rural future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible victory.
He can be voted on the newspaper's website until August 21st.
Bulgaria reports inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, Bulgaria's monthly inflation was 1% in July.
This is the highest value in many years (since June 2012) and the first time it has risen to more than zero since October last year, when the country reported a positive inflation rate of 0.2 per cent.
The average annual inflation measured by CPI over the last 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. the monthly inflation rate was 1.0%.
The rate of inflation since the beginning of the year (July 2016 per cent compared to December 2015 per cent) has been -0.2 per cent, and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2 per cent.
Compared to the previous month in July 2016, the prices of the following categories of consumer goods were raised: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), vehicles (1.8%), recreation and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household appliances and fixed-term maintenance (0.5%) and health (0.1%).
The prices of the following product groups remained on level with the previous month: alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat's anime effect is criticized as Asian caricature
Snapchat said the filter was inspired by anime, but some observers say it is racist.
With Snapchat's lens tool, about 150 million daily users can change reality and play with identity in ways that approach absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character in Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lens are unpretentious tools that distort characteristics, creating over 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All missteps quickly come to the public.
Snapchat's lenses have received criticism, where it has been accused of favoring blackface makeup or bleached skin tone as a beauty ideal.
So when it provided some of its users this week with a filter that turned their eyes crooked, distorted their teeth and made the cheeks chubby, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people.
Critics also wondered whether these repeated conflicts point to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and rage spread widely on Wednesday, and it was written, among other things, by The Verge and Motherboard the day after Snapchat said he removed the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was meant as a tribute to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some strongly denied the anime metaphor.
Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani, whose tweet of the pictures was widely distributed, said in her e-mail that the lens was "at least offensive and awkward."
He adds: "It's hard to deny that a very tasteless Asian caricature is like a filter effect.
It shows that the filter is not just a "yeslowface", but one that has been taken to a derogatory extreme."
Snapchat is not the only company that has to avoid these cultural traps.
There seems to be an endless struggle in American culture about diversity and social inclusion, from corporate governments to Hollywood and the equipment we carry with us.
Snapchat's audience consists of young people with more ethnic backgrounds than their older counterparts, which may mean that they are likely to expect even more discretion.
"When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that offends the user, things like this don't go unnoticed very easily like before," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
Zhu, who works as Product Manager and Designer at Medium release platform, decided on Thursday to remove his Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In a medium-published article and phone interview, he said he believed that ethnic conflicts reflected a lack of appreciation for diversity in Snapchat's recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized most of the company's leadership, consisting of white men and men alone, and ended his writing with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's either that there are no colored people on their one-sided staff, so they can make decisions like this, or they also have colored employees, but their position is not such as to dare to express their opinions directly and easily," says Zhu, a Chinese-American.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to answer the claim.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic backgrounds of its staff, claiming its status as a private company.
On Thursday Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic backgrounds of its staff, but according to its spokesman, the company has recently hired a recruiter to focus on under-represented groups of people and promoting inclusion within the company.
For their part, Zhu says he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to say this is not OK."
Congressional expert group said military officials distorted intelligence about ISIS
The Congressional Group of Experts published a report on Thursday that officers from the United States Armed Forces, Central Command, modified intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than what the events in the field gave reason to understand.
The Republican presidents of the sub-committee on intelligence and defence resources of the House Armed Services Committee set up a task force to report on the "general discontent" of military intelligence analysts, saying senior military officials embellished their assessments of American actions against ISIS.
Central Command, in brief Centcom, is the United States military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence results approved by Centcom's senior leaders generally gave a more positive picture of U.S. counter-terrorism actions than the facts in the field showed and were, without exception, more positive than those of other intelligence units," reports a press release on the report.
"It's unacceptable what happened at Centcom – our soldiers suffer when high-level political decision-makers are presented with false analyses," said California Republican Representative Ken Calvert.
"Centcom's management mistakes extend to the highest level of the organisation."
A 10-page report details the continuing problems that Central Command's descriptions and analyses of American actions to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
Even though the report does not contain conclusive evidence that Obama's government officials ordered reports have been forged, it gives an analysis of analysts that suggests Centcom leaders had pressured them to give a more optimistic view of the threat posed by ISIS.
"In the first half of 2015, many of Central Command's press releases, statements and congressional testimony were much more positive than what actually happened," says the report.
"For example, a Centcom official made a public statement that a large military assault to take back Mosul could already take place in April or May 2015."
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, is still under ISIS control.
"After months of research, this is very clear," said Mike Pompeo, Kansas Republican spokesman in a press release.
"From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest-ranking U.S. military intelligence leaders manipulated the intelligence results obtained to underplay the threat of ISIS in Iraq."
The Republicans set up a task force after learning about the suspicions expressed by analysts that intelligence about ISIS had been manipulated.
The report published on Thursday will be followed by more detailed results, as the studies will continue.
In addition, the Chief Inspector-General of the Ministry of Defense has launched an investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee published their own results, which were partly in line with the conclusions of the Republican task force.
"From 2014 to 2015, Centcom created an overly limited process of evaluating intelligence on ISIS and Iraqi security forces," said Adam B. Schiff, a high-ranking democrat.
According to Schiff, this process "was delaying the publication of intelligence results, "injuring analysts' morale, and "insufficiently paying attention to divergent views."
However, according to Schiff and the Democrats, there was no evidence that the White House had tried to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions to "predicted or political official lines."
News site Daily Beast reported on the preliminary results of a congressional study on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an investigation of the Pentagon chief inspector general, which began as a result of actions filed by Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, said in his statement that the Department of Defense will not comment on the congressional report as long as the inspector general's investigation is ongoing.
However, he says: "Sometimes experts disagree with the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a wholesome dialogue on these key issues of national security."
The investigation has other repercussions besides trying to determine whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (a claim made by several defence authorities).
However, the allegations made last year called into question how much President Obama can rely on Central Command and give honest assessments of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of intelligence about ISIS is consistent with the differences that arose over a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study that said President George W. Bush's government, despite protests from many analysts, only supported small troops in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would result from the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against intelligence about ISIS.
According to the authorities, last year, Hooker's team concluded that, despite opposing public statements, air strikes at the refineries controlled by ISIS had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's economy because it had built temporary refineries and was able to sell oil on the black market.
However, the result of the study was not passed outside Central Command, reported The Times in September.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised last year after many legislators had estimated that the testimony given to the Senate was too positive for the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel as Central Command commander.
The United States will win the fourth duel in women's field hockey and establish its position in a confrontation with Britain
After scoring three goals in a winning 6-1 win against Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team on Thursday, when the United States won India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had done the same thing before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I don't belong to people who keep track of their goals."
But he knows this: The Americans have won four games in their Olympic tournament and lost zero games, and in their group they share the first place with Britain, who continued their winning streak when on Thursday they won Japan 2-0.
Britain and the United States will play against each other on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams made it to the finals, which determine which of them will be the first and which of the six teams will be the second.
First-placer avoids a longer encounter with the hard-core Dutch team, who won the second block.
Despite what happens on Saturday's game, the Americans have already raised a stir about their surprising success in these games, four years after it was the last of 12 teams in the London Olympics.
Bam was also on the team in London.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and didn't grab the field hockey bat for the first time until he was 3 years old (his older twin sisters played the sport in Drexel), and he was 16 years old and was the youngest national team player of all time.
He missed the 2008 Olympics when he did not make it to the final list of players.
After this came the 2012 competitions, where he and his team did not see much success.
The following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed as a coach, after which things began to change.
"The change was cultural, mental and physical," Bam said.
"Our pace of work in London was not what it is now.
We have turned around."
On Thursday night, Bam opened the goal in the first half by hitting the ball close by with a knuckle.
India had come to the game without a win in the tournament, but it turned out to be a surprisingly tough opponent and kept a 1-0 score until the third period Bam stepped into the field.
Bam carried the ball along the left side of the field for a long time, squirming into the middle field, hitting the ball to the finish line, leading the Americans to 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal halfway through the fourth period.
The game was the first in the tournament, where U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty, and in the first three games, one hit had sunk in the goal.
Briggs is now living in a successful season,
So did Bam.
"Our investment is now good," said Parnham, but how good, it depends on the result of Saturday's game.
In the middle of the Olympic hulina, the trampoline brings Zen
Regardless of the place and the time, the Olympics are inevitable.
The events, competitions and struggles in Rio de Janeiro seem to follow as an intense message constantly and everywhere.
As if the Olympic fire itself were a flaming baton that moves from archer to swimmer, swimmer to gymnast and gymnast to triathlonist.
You cannot open a TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the cafe queue without avoiding hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
The first-time Olympic Dooley charms with a smile and might well be the name on everyone's lips that would be seen and heard at the best viewing and listening time, would be favored by sponsors and would appear in a good mood TV commercials if he were just a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28 from Lake Forest, California, competes for Olympic gold on trampoline.
Olympic fire does not shed an equal light on all competitions.
Further away from the center, partly in the shadow are less-known sports, such as air gun shooting, archery, badminton and taekwondo.
We will always have a breast swim, and may the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if I'm allowed to write a modest article about my own special favorite, I want to draw attention to the subdued charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since the Sydney Games in 2000, its visibility over the last 16 years has been so low that many people I interviewed didn't even know it was an Olympic sport.
Ignorance can be regional.
There have been athletes from the United States in the Olympic trampoline, but the country has never won the medals or progressed to the finals until 2012.
In the men's trampoline, the medals seem to go to the Chinese and the Russians, and the Canadians have taken the women's side of the medal prize.
China's Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie MacLennan are defending the gold medals they won in London this year.
However, there is the underdog's charm in trampoline, partly because it sounds more suitable for circus school than for the Olympics.
(I confess in this connection that I am not an expert, just an ordinary fan.)
The sport has its comic potential, which has been used in cartoons in the endless bouncing scenes of the characters, but it also has the same dignity as gymnastics and swimming jumps, that is, sports that are essentially combined in the trampoline.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampoline, meaning "bounce board."
Ambitious champions jump with a huge trampoline that throws them at a height of nearly 10 metres. Before landing, jumpers have to make a series of acrobatic movements, such as twists, folds and volts.
According to the official Olympic program, jumps are judged on performance, severity and "flight time."
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 different countries compete for a trampoline gymnastics championship, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction of Olympic sports is straight ahead.
When seeking gold, medallions have to go further, faster, up and over, sometimes across the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
In addition to the finish line or the starting wall, they also have another goal to pursue in televised reports, namely the world record or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is sublime, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to make the viewer cry.
But I also find this a bit exhausting just watching the games.
This is where the trampoline offers a breather.
In the trampoline, the direction is upward.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast bounces up weightless like an astronaut, falls down, and bounces back up effortlessly.
Of course, there is also a competition, and it's not easy either, but it has nothing to do with a frantic rush to the goal or jumping far, just a dreamy and smooth combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to Zen as an Olympic competition can get.
Women's qualifying matches and finals will take place on Friday afternoon and will begin at 1 pm local time and men's matches on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will send the finals as part of its afternoon broadcast, which will begin on both days at 2 p.m. local time.
In the middle of Olympiamania, there is a calm and wonderful moment that might go unnoticed in the midst of a general fuss.
And if awareness can only be raised by offering male athletes to be watched, and by objectifying them - as recently suggested by US male gymnasts, according to the Wall Street Journal - then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his gasping new fan group.
An entire generation protested in Ethiopia, a long-standing ally of the United States
Violent demonstrations in Ethiopia
Government forces have violently dismantled demonstrations demanding political change across Ethiopia.
According to witnesses, several protesters have been shot to death in clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking up?
For the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries and a trustworthy Western ally, with a fast-growing economy.
In recent months, however, the country has been shaken by anti-government demonstrations that are spreading to ever wider areas.
Just last week, thousands of people rushed to the streets demanding a fundamental political change.
According to human rights organisations, the government's reaction was ruthless.
Witnesses say the police shot and killed several unarmed protesters.
The videos of demonstrations, supposedly at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year, show how security forces beat young people with sticks who have been forced to stand up against the wall with their hands.
The UN's leading human rights officer is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep the country united, and it is even harder to move forward," says Rashid Abdi, research director of the International Crisis Group of the African Sarvi project.
Ethiopia, of its population, is the second largest country in Africa after Nigeria, whose stability has been promoted by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence services strongly support the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, especially in Somalia, and few African countries, if any, will receive this much help from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has improved radically, even a new urban train in Addis Ababa, the capital.
The streets of cities are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Ethiopia, however, is still a long way from a model country for democracy, with human rights organisations constantly reporting on government repressive policies, the opposition in the country is very limited and dissidents are quickly silenced.
Many people have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the wilderness.
But the situation may be changing.
"If the people are smothered and have no choice but to protest, it will burst out," says Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer at Central Ethiopia.
"The whole youth is protesting.
A whole generation protested.
There are many reasons for discontent, always from land use to the government coalition's stranglehold on power.
After the widely criticised elections last year, the ruling party and its allies got even the last seat previously belonging to the opposition, and as a result they now dominate the whole parliament.
At the same time, tensions are growing on the Eritrean border, where the aggravated situation claimed hundreds of deaths during the battle in June.
Analysts fear that more or less defeated separatist groups in recent years, such as Oromo's Liberation Front or Ogaden's National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the chaos and rearm themselves.
There are a number of reasons why the embittered mood that has been lurking under the surface for years is breaking out right now.
The first is obviously innocent: smartphones.
Only for the past couple of years have Ethiopians been able to communicate on social media, as cheaper smartphones became common and internet access improved.
Even when the government repeatedly block access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many people get access to the internet through proxy servers that hide their whereabouts.
Many Ethiopian youths said that this is how they invited people to demonstrations.
Another reason is the increase in solidarity between Ethiopia's two largest populations, the Oromas and the Amharas.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.
For a long time, the Amharas, mainly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, have dominated the country's politics and business and exploited oroms, many of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But this too is changing.
"The cooperation is deepening and we are getting under the same umbrella," says Oromo leader Mulatu Gemechu.
The biggest demonstrations have been in the Oromo and Amhara regions.
Many amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unjustly dominated by the Tigre tribe, which represents only about six per cent of the population, yet controls the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason behind the unrest is Meles Zenaw's death.
Former rebel leader Meles was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until he died of an unnamed illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius who could see around the corner.
Analysts said he was especially good at detecting the first signs of discontent and using ambassadors who compromised the relations between the opposing parties.
"The current government lacks this essential instinct," says conflict investigator Abdi.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, stepped into Meles' boots with almost no knowledge.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigren region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he doesn't have the trust of the Tigre-managed security forces.
Many fear that this means more bloodshed.
The last time there were similar riots in Ethiopia in 2005, when thousands protested against the elections that, according to analysts, the government first screwed up and then stole.
In the post-election unrest, many protesters were killed, although there were fewer deaths than in the previous months, and the unrest stopped relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for far-sighted infrastructure planning, such as the new urban train, and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But the internal resentment against Ethiopia's government has clearly not prevented it from getting stronger.
And a grudge is taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month in Amhara city Gondar, protesters attacked companies owned by tigres, and anti-tigree hate speech is becoming more common in social media.
Analysts say the protests put the United States and other Western allies in a difficult situation.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for drones monitoring neighboring Somalia, but the U.S. says the base has recently been closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its allies in an already unstable region to collapse.
"This requires tight balancing," said Abdi.
Donald Trump said he was being sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of ISIS
Donald J. Trump tried to withdraw his words on Friday in the latest dispute over his campaign by claiming that he was not serious about claiming several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were "founders" of the terrorist group Isis.
The clarification raised new questions to the Republican side about the presidential candidate's ability to communicate clearly to the citizens of his country.
His supporters, who have to try to defend their candidates during these stormy moments and explain comments that he may not have meant, are also in a awkward situation.
Trump made the claim at the election on Wednesday evening and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when claiming that the president and Hillary Clinton created ISIS.
Early Friday morning, however, Trump tweeted and said his claim was sarcasm.
Mr. Trump made a complete twist on the tweet about the previous day, when he said he had been completely serious about his accusations during several interviews.
When radio host and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by saying Obama was trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate refused to back off.
The latest review storm rose as Trump tried to focus his campaign back on the economy as the support numbers dropped.
Trump and Clinton gave their economic policy speech in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the topic again.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes and thought Clinton's speech was boring.
Trump has defended himself with sarcasm before.
At the end of July, he received widespread criticism when he seemed to urge the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's email and later explained his comments, saying: "Of course I was sarcastic."
In this way, Trump stretches the limits of political speech and draws back his words if necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing certain messages that are responsive to his supporters, watching supporters react to messages, and "solve" in one way or another, depending on the reactions," says Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who has been monitoring the language used by both presidential candidates.
"But I also believe he understands his claims and knows they are round enough to pass through different sieves."
Instead of softening his statements to the election audience, Trump has changed his style even more pungent in recent days as his polls have continued to decline.
A new poll by NBC, Wall Street Journal and Marist, published on Friday, said Trump's support is significantly lower than Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, while Florida has a tight level playing field.
While Trump usually tries to avoid apologizing for his provocative speeches, he often accuses critics of misinterpreting his words or of not understanding his sense of humor.
But since he was increasingly under scrutiny during the last months of his presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have put his loyal supporters in an awkward position, in which they are forced to publicly defend Trump's comments no matter how provocative they may be.
One of Trump's most prominent supporters, former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani vigorously defended the presidential candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I consider what he said to be a valid political speech," said Giuliani, when asked if Trump was truthful in claiming Obama and Hillary Clinton founded ISIS.
"It's true in the sense that before Obama, Isis was an almost unknown, small organization that Obama mistakenly called "a lower-series team" and that's why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq."
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, where Hillary Clinton was the Foreign Minister, allowed Isis to continue his actions when it failed to take decisive action in the Middle East.
Before Friday's election in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to attack the media on Twitter, accusing them of blaring his speeches and of having a discriminatory attitude towards him.
He mocked the "unsuitable and pathetic" TV commentators who try to find out about him, but he said they couldn't do it.
Some Democrats mocked Mr Trump's explanation, saying it only showed more clearly that he was not fit to be president.
The café that has stopped because of the excessive rent increase opens at Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a bit of a shabby cafe in Williamsburg, where only cash was paid for, and there was no Wi-Fi, but that offered good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the cafe was priced out of its streetside position on Bedford Avenue when the rent became excessive.
Soap Cherie, who replaced Verb Cafe in summer 2014, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
Locals find this loss of a coffee shop that has been avoided from middle-classing sad.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is no more, Chelsea Hotel has been destroyed and Verb is now a soap shop."
But even though New York is no longer the same, new ones will be created there.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new cafe in Greenpoint, just over a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb cafe has Wi-Fi and can be paid with a credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still unambitious.
The coffee is still good, too.
The owner and manager of the new Verb cafe is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe.
He started in Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to finance the opening of a new cafe, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the same.
Verb orders bagels from the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso machine model.
It also re-introduced even old Verb lamps.
Mr Rodriguez said, however, he wanted to try something new and
added new products to the list.
There are bacon-chicken-egg-cheese-sandwiches available and capers and browned onion rings for filling.
There are also dark rice bowls on the list.
There is no more beer at the cafe, but instead juices made from fresh fruit.
After nine months of keeping the cafe, Rodriguez said he noticed that old regulars began to visit the Verb as a steady stream.
"A lot of our old customers were also priced out of Williamsburg," he said.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who recently visited the cafe on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited Verb regularly.
Even after moving to Greenpoint, he took walks to Verb, then still in Williamsburg.
When Verb was closed, he said he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized I liked Verb's coffee and culture," he said.
Now he's drinking coffee again, even though on that Sunday he took a chai tea mix instead of his usual iced coffee, which is also on the list.
Another long-time customer, Tom Rosenthal, faithfully visited Verb since 2003.
He always went to the cafe before work and ordered the same without exception.
"I came to the cafe every day at quarter past seven, like a plane, and there they already prepared my voibage with all the fillings," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to the menu.
Nowadays, Rosenthal still orders his standard product, but occasionally he varies from bacon, egg and cheese fillings to his bagel.
Rodriguez says he doesn't hold a grudge about the soap store taking the old place.
Soap Cherie's owners even offered to make a special soap, which is made with Verb's own cold-dried coffee.
"We may still take the offer," Rodriguez said.
Poles who have traditionally lived in Greenpoint have also welcomed the cafe with joy.
One of the new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez now says he's looking for a suitable place to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has brought with it other benefits.
The local juice company wants to bottle and sell cold-dried coffee from the cafe.
The cafe may also expand to the next building.
For many customers, though, it is enough to get their old favourites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular in Williamsburg, and he said his heart was broken when the cafe was closed.
When the new place was opened and I ordered a coffee there, it felt like coming home, says Whitt.
"I missed the smell of the coffee shop."
Ugly food from the Great Depression in a new work: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in his office in the White House for lunch.
President Roosevelt, who was known as a culinaryist, was fond of the luxurious dishes of Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as foie liver paste and Maryland turtle soup.
On that day his menu was more modest: Devil's eggs (deviled eggs) in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and for dessert, plum pudding.
"It was a sign of culinary solidarity for the people who suffered," Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, adds: "It was also a message to the Americans about how they should eat."
The couple in Brooklyn Heights both work as food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, tells about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman's latest book, 97 Orchard, tells the story of an apartment building in the Lower East Side district through food.
Their new joint work is A Square Meal, published by Harper and published on Tuesday, depicting the history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity when agreeing to meet a journalist at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small and ordinary lunch bar near Flatiron skyscraper and opened the same year as the big stock market crash happened, 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and olive-filled sandwich and 57-year-old Coe for turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When the reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple said it was very suitable for the discussion about eating a major depression.
"Musemies were very popular," Jane Ziegelman said.
People ate peanut loaf, liverloaf and beanloaf.
They were made from substances that were cheap and sufficient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they will be enough for the whole meal."
Andrew Coe grins.
"It must have weighed like lead in the stomach," he said.
Before the great recessions, the American dining table, especially in rural areas, was based on the buffet principle of "eat as much as you want."
Women cooked for farm workers, and freshly baked pies were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal is the chronicle of how the people survived when they suddenly had to give up the abundance.
"This was a time when food became a central and distressing topic for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
As distressing was the new affordable diet: according to Ziegelman, mysterious dishes such as crumbs and casseroles became the main dish, and the casseroles were called "a great way to take advantage of the leftovers," because chefs could cover not so attractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which for years had been the main part of an American meal, became a sparingly used luxury.
Strange mixes were tried, where the most important thing was to meet calorie and nutritional values rather than taste or even a healthy kitchen sense.
While doing research for a book, which also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared baked onions filled with peanut butter as a food for shortage.
"It didn't get any popularity at the dinner table," Coe said,
Ziegelman adds: "It was unreal.
Peanut butter and onion do not fit at all.
This was characteristic of many household recipes."
Household experts, like Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Home Office between 1923 and 1943, directed the eating habits of citizens in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, encouraging women to be precise budgetmakers and to meet the challenge of turning carrot-cream-pags into tasty dishes.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical treats.
Especially tasty are reports of the government's reactions to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat cake" attitude.
While publicly praising his childhood's simple food on a Iowa farm, he himself ate, like a millionaire and a sophisticated master he had become.
"He liked continental cuisine, like fish and cucumber sauce," Coe said.
"He ate almost in a gold-coated dining room wearing a tuxedo.
He was completely alienated from reality."
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't encouraged him to set an example with his stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who wasn't at all interested in the taste, the food served in the White House was not only the most boring in Washington, but also the least poorly prepared."
Many of the food from the recession was abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of the tradition is still reflected in how we pay attention to calories and food intake and how science has been applied to cooking.
When writing the book, the couple said they had begun to understand Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, such as why she couldn't throw away the food.
"He was really afraid that food would have to be thrown away," said Coe.
"People even began to get sick from his food," recalls Ziegelman.
"For example, once for wind hats."
After the main dish plates were emptied at Eisenberg's lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe took out the plum dessert they prepared at home, the same one President Roosevelt ate at his lunch.
"It's called plum mousse," Ziegelman said, adding that it was a common trick to name modest recipes.
There was no whipped cream, just plums, little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We reluctantly sunk our spoon into thick brown goo.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe sanded a second time and a third.
"The walnuts would make this better," Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budget holder.
Gilead's full compensation for legal fees for a patent dispute with Merck on a hepatitis C drug
The U.S. regional court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to full compensation for the legal fees it received for the patenting of a hepatitis C drug against drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from $200 million in damages for the violation of two Merck-owned patents in connection with Gilead's successful drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni, and the U.S. judge found Merck to have committed violations involving perjury and other unethical practices.
In an appeal registered on Thursday, U.S. regional court judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to the exemption from the legal fees it received for defending the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which controls the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can treat over 90 percent of patients with hepatitis C.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and demanded private ownership of the sofosbuvir under laboratory work, which is the active ingredient in Gilead drugs.
U.S.-supported forces have taken Manbij from Isis
The U.S.-supported forces have taken control of the city of Manjib, near the Turkish border in northern Syria, as the last extremist ISIS fighters left the city, says the spokesman for the troops.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) group is now scouring the city to find the last Isis fighters hiding in the city.
Sharfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council of the SDF, told Reuters that 2,000 hostages abducted by ISIS fighters have been released.
"We are now in full control of the city, but we are still conducting search operations," Darwish said.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% federal tax
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton released his 2015 tax return on Friday, showing that his and his husband's income at that time was $10.75 million and the real federal tax rate they paid was 34.2.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton making nearly $5.3 million in speech fees, and Hillary Clinton, who previously served as Foreign Minister, said he earned $3 million from Simon & Schuster publisher for his book on his term of office in the State Department.
Clinton's vice presidential candidate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine and his wife Anne Holton announced 10-year tax returns.
The real federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to model economic transparency," says Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in a statement.
The complete opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and cancels his promises to release his tax returns.
According to the custom, US presidential candidates have always published their tax records, even though the law does not require them to do so.
A New York businessman, Trump, and his lawyers have appealed to the IRS for an audit and say it's the reason Trump hasn't released his income data.
"The transfer is yours" tweeted Clinton's campaign assistant, Ian Sams, referring to the Democratic candidate's tax records.
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release his tax records until the inspections were completed.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said that his refusal to disclose information raises questions about Trump's equity, his contributions to charity, business relations and many other ties, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has taken up this issue and released a video online on Friday to highlight prominent Republicans who are pushing Trump to release his tax records.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the issue in his economic speech in Michigan.
"Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades, and does not publish his tax returns," Clinton said to the crowd.
According to Politico, Trump did not pay taxes at all or just a little for two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist quoted several tax lawyers and auditors on Friday that the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a key issue in the presidential election.
Clinton has supported a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that those making over $1 million a year would pay at least 30 percent of the tax.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, at a Clinton election in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose main headquarters in the Berkshire Hathaway multi-purpose company is located in the same place, challenged Trump to meet, where they would both reveal their tax records.
Buffet says that he has also been audited by the IRS and that Trump is not afraid of the IRS, but of voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid a real federal tax of 32 percent on average between 2007 and 2014 and the real combined tax rate they paid was about 40.5 percent.
The Clinton tax returns for 2015 show that unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was paid.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clintons reported dividend and interest income to be $19,000.

Chili powder-filled condoms to support elephant protection in Tanzania
Wildlife conservationists in Tanzania have found an unusual way to keep elephants away from human settlements - elephants are rushed by throwing condoms filled with chilli powder at them.
The method has proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which created the idea a few years ago, has, together with the United States Nature Conservancy, launched a campaign to teach volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania how to protect their homes and crops without damaging elephants.
Not long ago spears were used to rush elephants.
Friday is the world's elephant day, dedicated to the protection of animals.
"After developing the method, we have seen a change in attitudes in these villages, because now the villagers can rely on them to keep elephants from their fields without harming them," says Damian Bell, Executive Director of the Honeyguide Foundation in his statement.
First, the intrusive elephant is rushed with a flashlight and a horn.
If this doesn't work, throw a so-called chilli cloud.
The mixed chilli powder is placed in a condom together with the firecracker, and then the end of the condom is twisted so that only the fuse is left outside.
When the fuse is lit, the condom explodes and spreads a fine cloud of chilli powder into the air.
Usually one cloud of spices is enough to drive an elephant away.
The last thing is a thrower that shoots a fireworks known as a Roman candle into the air and creates a loud and bright explosion.
A Jewish filmmaker criticized a Berlin hotel for removing Israel's area code from Arab "call" – RT News
A French film director from his roots, a Jewish background, gave birth to media rage after revealing that the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel does not mention Israel's area code in its country code list, and the hotel employee appealed to the "calls" from Arabic customers when asked.
Claude Lanzmann, author of Shoah's Holocaust documentary, vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
During his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of code numbers offered by the hotel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries you can call directly from the room.
"How is it that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been completely destroyed – as if it did not exist?"
Lanzmann writes.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel via a separate call centre.
The film director asked for an explanation about the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes that the receptionist's response upset him.
The receptionist said that removing Israel from the list was "a carefully considered decision by the hotel management of Kempinski."
The reason behind the operation further upset the film director.
According to Lanzmann, the official said: "Most of our guests are Arabs, and they are calling for Israel's area code to be removed."
Israel's German ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, interviewed by Suddeutsche Zeitung, called the case "a great shame."
"We are all shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's a great shame.
And the more shameful it is, given that we are in Germany and this is the very chain of hotels.
That is all that is needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," says the ambassador.
The incident caused quite a reaction online, where it was called a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of simply giving in to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Desperate" was said in a publication that highlighted the hotel's location near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm Street.
Der Spiegel writes that the hotel denied the charges quickly, called the incident a mistake and apologized to Lanzmann.
"The direct order to exclude Israel from the code list was never given," writes Suddeutsche Zeitung, a representative of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the area code has since been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to protest against Brazilian students
Students clashed with the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered together to protest against government reform of the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The riot began when law enforcement officials tried to break up the student group, as a result of which the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students who wanted to demonstrate their dismay at the government's plans took part in the demonstration.
Mr. Geraldo Alckmin, governor of the state of Sao Paulo, has made a proposal for a austerity measure to close nearly 100 public schools and place 300,000 students in new schools.
Some of the protesters made graffiti on the walls against Michel Temer, who was temporarily in charge of the presidency.
The student demonstration took place just a few days after the streets were filled with protesters in favour of the excommunicated President Dilma Rousseff, when the Senate voted on an official charge.
Trade between Russia and Iran has grown 71% – RT Business
Since the end of the sanctions, the annual trade exchange between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent, says Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
According to him, Russian companies' interest in business in Iran has grown since international sanctions against Iran were lifted.
Russian companies continue existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
The further expansion of trade is, of course, one of the top priorities in cross-border cooperation," Dzhagaryan says.
He notes that during the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and increased to $856 million.
Russia's exports to Iran, especially, rose rapidly by 91.5 per cent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent to $158 million.
The trade was accelerated by the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
"Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of which were travel visas.
In addition, Iran was for the first time among the first 20 countries with tourists travelling in Russia.
And it is not too daring to say that the record number of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year," he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend travelling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Scot Callum Skinner scored as the British won the gold of cycling
Scottish Callum Skinner drew attention to the reputation of men's team print at Rio velodrom last night, when the Great Britain trio defended the title earned in London 2012.
The 23-year-old Skinner of Glasgow was in the anchor he inherited from his fellow Scottish Sir Chris Hoy, who made the legend proud as he rushed to the finish line and captured the victory from the favourite New Zealand team.
Britain won a surprise victory four years ago when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic golds.
And they repeated the trick after they had finished sixth in March in the London World Championship, despite the fact that Hoy had since left his competition career.
The problem between Beijing and London was replacing Jamie Staff, who specialises in the role of the first leader.
Hindes came out just in time.
Hoy's decision to end the race career also left a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Scottish Skinner was the man the British coaches believed in and saw the potential he has now redeemed.
Hindes, Kenny and Skinner, who won the championship with Hoy four years ago, made the Olympic record in time, but in the first round, New Zealand was faster.
And Britain's trio won gold in a duel.
Hindes was close behind after his round, but Kenny struggled to lead the team, which Skinner retained.
A big part of the change was to change the strategy so that Hindes drove to slow the pace at a higher gear, which enabled Kenny and Skinner in particular to keep up the pace.
Hoy followed from his post as a BBC commentator and reached Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they stepped on the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow says: "I'm flattered about the comparison.
I'm just trying to do my best and succeed.
We made an Olympic record in the finals and won the world champions.
It was incredible.
There is no better way to win it."
After winning in London in 2012, Hindes, together with Kenny and Hoy, deliberately admitted to falling on the track because of a bad start.
Later, he withdrew, and Britain's rivals had no way to complain.
This time there were no problems like this with the sovereign victory.
Hindes says: "It was like London, all the tickets from Great Britain were in the stands.
Our team became united during the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships that winning the Olympics feels great."
In other words, one competition, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of ten track championships in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of the progress that has been made in the last five months, we are facing a successful five-day velodrom.
As Kenny has shown by his abilities, it is not impossible to imagine that he will repeat Hoy's achievements and win three Olympic golds in one Olympics.
This would mean an account with six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, and who was born also on March 23 (the magical date of British sports, also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday).
The medallions would then be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny is next in the race for the sprint, which begins today and will be settled in three days.
Bolton 28-year-old Kenny says: "At the moment, I can only rejoice in this.
The team competition is always the best.
You will enjoy the victory together with your friends.
Winning alone is a bit lonely."
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he needs to win the knight's rank."
This was the only medal contest of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest in a four-man team race.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The world record that was made in London 2012 and won gold is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final (at 22.42 pm) will be held today on the second day of the competition, and Wiggins will certainly be the focus of attention.
Yesterday he had an argument with the competition operators before the time drive, when they invited him to measure his height.
In a similar women's competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavie reached the world record time of 4:13.260.
Great Britain's team can now count on its great cycling team to take over the middle of the Olympics and bring a number of medals to the country.
After the truly exceptional demonstrations of full leadership in Beijing and London, expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
There have been dramas in the background, the least of which is not the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April, amidst claims of sexism and bullying, and the end of major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, the competitions held on velodrome the first night show that Britain's already legendary reputation of climbing to the top at the perfect moment is once again realised.
Portland smelter's future at stake due to the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the aluminium smelter plant in the state of Victoria, Portland, and thus the jobs of thousands of employees are at stake when the power company that supplies electricity to the smelter said that one of the plant's owners is dissolving the supply contract and it is expected that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This is the result of Victoria's government's decision earlier this year not to continue the subsidies that keep the plant running.
The flat-rate 20-year grant will expire in November.
The Alcoa Portland plant is in danger of losing up to 2,000 jobs.
As many as 2,000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk as a result of the closures.
The snowball effect can continue to grow, as the smelter consumes about 10 per cent of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's smelter, which led to the closure of Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa Portland's smelter is losing money and is in danger of closing its doors.
The measures correspond to the speculations that have been going on for years about the future of the plant, first caused by a strong Australian dollar and recently by the cost of the factory's production.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminium smelter from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says it expects that the other three owners of the smelter plant will also terminate their contract.
The majority owner of the plant is Alcoa-Alumina joint venture, with Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp holding minority shares.
AGL says it expects the Portland plant to remain in operation, meaning that the physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue.
AGL says the contracts are so-called hedging contracts that were to come into effect in November 2016.
The notice period for contracts is 12 months, so they will end in 2017.
"As a result, AGL expects the contracts to generate revenue in the financial year 2017," says the power plant.
Potential returns for AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by strong future market prospects for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL already said that it had reduced the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million "as an advance for the termination of the contracts."
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to keep the smelter operational or to secure the supply of electricity to the smelter."
The American company said it had made a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to come into effect from November of this year, even though it still has to figure out why it has now withdrawn from the deal.
Due to the weak financial situation in the sector, analysts have been cautious about their estimates of both the smelting plant in Portland, Victoria, and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
AGL's operational director Stephen Mikkelsen said in a speech to analysts earlier in the week that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity on an annual basis and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
"If these plants leave the market, it will mean a significant drop in demand in the (electricity) market.
For us as a producer, that would not be good news," Mikkelsen says.
Kardashians reality star Kendall as cover girl of September Vogue
The Kardashian-Jenner clan model and his mother and manager Kris's fourth daughter Kendall Jenner, 20, pose in the famous September issue of U.S. Vogue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's ad face and performs in Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news on his Instagram account on Thursday.
"Looking at the deck in a room full of my loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The release of the cover was followed by a strange (or maybe just a Kardashians style?), a handwritten video that featured all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (bar-harassers Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favourite uncle, producer Ryan Seacrest) who had forgotten his sister's cover picture, ending in a classic twist: they were all planning a surprise party for their sister.
The plot is cliche and is used in almost every degree programme birthday session (Seacrest said: "You thought we'd forgotten you?" as sincerely as the cartoon character of the children's morning TV), but Krisin had to get the rest of her daughter involved in this publicity in some way.
For the appearance in the September issue of Vogue is undoubtedly a new era for the Kardashians.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have reached the cover of Vogue before (she appeared on the cover of Vogue together with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is quite unique.
The September issue is Vogue's most sold release in the year.
More of a big picture book than a fashion magazine-like issue attracts a large number of advertisers (a fashion site from Fashion calculated that last year's 832-page opus had 615 pages of ads).
The release of the September cover star is so eagerly expected that in the previous two years, the pictures of the magazine have been leaked to the public even before the official announcement.
Previously, the cover models for September have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, celebrities working as models have been on the cover rather than models that are celebrities.
Oscar winner and Dior ad face Jennifer Lawrence were on the cover in 2013, and a year later Lady Gaga got the credit.
The magazine describes Jenner as a successful model of his generation, and even if he were more of a model-working celebrity, he is in quite good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of well-known people, reality stars or children today who know how to make a good Snapchat video (even though Jenner is all about these things).
You can rightly call them talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry more than anyone else.
Beyonce, who appeared on the cover last year, has one of the strongest years of her career, when she released her Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Because of his reality-TV background, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, Victoria's Secret's original model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and his colleague Gigi Hadid by calling them "the bitches."
These feelings have flared up again when news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue came out.
However, the constant squirming of discontent seems irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is a cover model for the September issue of Vogue.
He is a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
He's walking around in Marc Jacobs' fashion show.
He's an ad face for Estee Lauder makeup creams.
He and all his sisters sell pictures of themselves through pay-per-view applications.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, who he was shooting for Love magazine.
And in his spare time, he performs on reality TV, perhaps just as a way to meet his sister and her children.
Legal aid centres turn away 160,000 people a year
Every year, more than 160,000 of the most vulnerable people in the country are turned away from legal aid centres, and the sector is preparing for the effects that further cuts will have on the centres already operating at the limit.
In Queensland, three of those seeking free legal aid and legal services are already turned away from five people - the majority of them are elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unjustified evictions and similar injustices without resources.
Public legal aid services, whose workload has already been overloaded, are preparing for further cuts in the budget.
As of June next year, legal aid centres are in danger of losing another 30 per cent of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Public Legal Aid Center, says that thousands of people are already turned away from the centres each year, according to the latest calculation report drawn up by the National Legal Aid Centres' National Association.
If the federal government does not twist its decision, Farrell says the situation will only get worse.
"Queensland public legal aid centres are constantly underfunded, meaning thousands of people will be turned away as they seek the necessary services they need," Farrell said.
"People leaving out of violent relationships, people under an uncontrolled and crippling debt burden, divorced families, workers who have been unduly laid off – all of them have problems with legal issues, and this report shows they are not able to get the help they need.
The federal government plans to cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, which means that thousands of Queensland's most vulnerable have to deal with complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Attorney General and Queensland Senator George Brandis to give up these financial cuts immediately so people can get the legal aid they need.
Last year the state administration fulfilled its promise to bring legal aid funding to the national average.
Now is the time to take into account the needs of public legal aid centres and their clients, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work."
Donald Trump's campaign was sued for threatening an employee with a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly not taking any action after its leadership was told that the manager of North Carolina had threatened the employee with a gun while driving in the Jeep in February.
The event is described in an action filed by former state campaign software trainer Vincent Bordini in a state court in Charlotte on Wednesday.
Bordini said he had waited for months for the situation to be dealt with internally before he understood, according to his own words, that this was not going to happen.
Bordini said in his lawsuit that campaign manager Earl Phillip "put out a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger and pressed a barrel into Vincent's kneecap."
According to the complaint, after making a complaint to the local and regional management of the campaign, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experienced the same thing with Phillip.
"Even if a gun is not fired, it will cause damage," Bordini said in his lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused a general rage when he said to the crowd in North Carolina that "second-round supporters" - who are considered gun owners and gun enthusiasts - can take action if his opponent Hillary Clinton wins the election and gets to choose the judges.
Trump's campaign staff said the media took his words out of context and Trump did not use his words to encourage violence.
In his lawsuit, Bordini claims compensation from the campaign for indifferent conduct and Phillip for assault, assault and emotional suffering.
Trump's spokesman, Hope Hicks, did not immediately reply to a message asking him for a comment.
Despite attempts, Phillip was not reached.
Charlotte's local news agency WCCB said Phillip recently left the campaign.
Phillip's consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, received no immediate response to the call.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has conducted a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must use the Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also revives the economy and creates well-being - not just in local communities and London, but in the whole country.
For me, this was the most interesting thing in Heathrow, and like in the 2012 London Olympics, we made a huge effort to benefit our whole nation and all our regions.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratford and East End.
We will do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships and 40,000 new jobs, which will eliminate youth unemployment in the surrounding areas of the airport.
Like the London Olympics in 2012, there are always people who think Heathrow's expansion is too big a challenge.
As far as the Olympics are concerned, I learned that Britain will never be ready for them and that we are going to find ourselves in an awkward situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and they will also be wrong about Heathrow.
There will always be obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow will answer every question it asks.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is also an infrastructure project that benefits not just the few, but many.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and increase the economy by £211 billion, bringing skills and employment both to the airport environment and to the UK as a whole.
We have a great task force at Heathrow, which has carried out on time and by keeping to the budget a £11 billion infrastructure investment programme that included the T5 terminal - which has been voted the best air terminal of the year for two consecutive years - and the T2 terminal, which was built in the middle of two of the most crowded runways in the world.
Now they are ready to produce a third runway, backed by a private investment of £16 billion.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be an expansion of Heathrow.
It is time we used the same Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow so that we can guarantee the future of our trade and create the skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the chairman of Heathrow's board and former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook in anti-advertising cat-mouse games
The attempts of companies that earn money from online advertising to distract anti-ad software have turned into cat-mouse play, says one company that produces blocking software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook had announced on its own page that it was blocking advertising programs, Adblock Plus published a blog post where it said users could update the filters of their blocking software and thus again block ads from the social networking service.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would change the label codes for ads on its desktop website, making it harder for anti-advertising software to identify which parts of the page are ads.
Now, though, Adblock says he's solved the new codes.
Adbuck's publicist Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that "this kind of balling between the open source anti-advertising community and the misdirectors has been going on ever since the anti-advertising was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon make its own repair move again.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of the concern that ad blockers have become in the industry.
Globally, an estimated 200 million people use anti-advertising software, reports a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year, which has nearly quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook is used daily on mobile devices by 1.03 million active users, and mobile advertising already accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
However, the company plans to invest in misleading ad-block programs in its desktop application, because according to the publicist, mobile ad-block programs do not work on Facebook's mobile apps and Instagram.
The revenues from Desktop ads are still high enough, which is why Facebook considered the investment worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook also said that it will update the ad tool for user settings so that users can more control how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticizes Adblock's new filters, as they also prevent the appearance of some of the usual Facebook writings.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to solve the problem," Facebook's spokesman said in an e-mail release.
"Impression programs are clumsy and inefficient, and that is why we have instead invested in developing user settings such as ad tools, so people can control the targeting of ads themselves."
A woman committed suicide by leaving herself under cars on a Swiss motorway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police are asking for witnesses' help on the motorway for the first hours of Thursday's accident, in which a woman deliberately left herself under several cars.
The accident happened on the A1 motorway in Vaud canton near Morges shortly after midnight.
The woman did her desperate thing by laying down on a dark road, and she was hit by more cars, says Vaud police in a press release.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman with a clear aim of committing suicide, including a lorry.
The woman died at the scene.
According to the police, many of the drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some have still not been identified, and the police are asking them or other witnesses to report themselves.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter says in Le Tribune de Geneva that a criminal investigation has been launched, which is a logical step in a situation like this.
However, it remains to be seen whether the drivers involved in the accident will be charged.
"Was it impossible to avoid a collision?
That will remain for the prosecutor to find out, says Hofstetter.
In the last five years, there have been two similar cases that do not hold drivers responsible.
According to the newspaper, in both cases a person walked on a motorway in the dark and the court ruled that motorists cannot expect to run into a pedestrian on a motorway in the middle of the night.
Last year, a police officer was released from the charge of involuntary death of a man who was lying on the A1 near Paynerne on one August night in 2014.
The court heard that a 22-year-old victim had drunk heavily and passed out on the road.
The court found that the police - who were about to respond to the distress call - were justified in driving and that the man on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation."
Anyone who knows about the accident near Morges on Thursday is asked to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus has been viable
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus may have been viable.
NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model to study Venus' past with the same tools and algorithms as climate scientists use.
The model was designed to determine whether the conditions in Venus could sometimes be similar to those on Earth, even though Venus is shallowly hot and waterless and its atmosphere consists almost entirely of carbon dioxide.
According to the researchers' previous performances, Venus' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere.
However, based on the latest simulation, it can be assumed that Venus has had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and it has still been spinning slowly.
The model was also used to determine the early Venus topography.
The planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographical variation to sustain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 per cent dimmer.
"In the GISS modeling, Venus spins slowly and its daily side is almost two months at a time per sun," says GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and creates rain that creates a thick layer of cloud, which acts like an umbrella and protects the surface largely from the sun's heat.
As a result, the average temperatures in the climate are even a few degrees lower than Earth's current temperatures.
The model was used to create Venus' story, which corresponds to the planet scientists' earlier assumptions about its development.
Even though Venus may have been viable, it has, for several billion years, been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light.
Its oceans evaporated, and ultraviolet light burned vaporized water.
In hydrogen karate, only a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere and a deadly greenhouse effect remained in space - that is, Venus as it is today.
Researchers reported the results of the new Venus climate modelling in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and vice president of the club's hockey operations, claiming a lack of influence in the team's decision-making.
Colorado vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the club will immediately start applying for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have performed my duties as head coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and vice president of the club's hockey operations with energy, passion and determination," says Roy, 50 years old, in his statement.
"In the summer, I've been thinking long and hard about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the coach and the club's vice president of hockey operations must be in complete agreement with the organisation.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are not currently met."
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his investment in the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakic says.
"We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him well for the future."
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the league's top coach for his first season as Avalanche's head coach from 2013 to 2014.
Under his leadership, the club reached 112 points and won the middle division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoffs and hasn't made the extension in the last two years.
Avalanche reached 39-39-4 power points during the season 2015-2016 and stayed five points away from Minnesota Wild while playing from another Wild Card position at the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goaltender Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career - two in the Montreal Canadiens and two in the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers start negotiations and stop the strike
The main negotiators say the North Sea oil workers' pay strikes will be interrupted when all the parties involved in the dispute take part in a new round of negotiations.
There have been strikes against Wood Group, which offers oil field services, on drilling platforms that are controlled by Royal Dutch Shell in the North Sea.
According to a joint statement by the parties, "Wood Group and trade unions Unite and RMT confirm that they have agreed to resume the process in order to resolve the dispute."
From the beginning of next week, we will be holding a number of full-day meetings over the next few weeks, dealing with problems from fresh points of view.
The trade unions justified their recent actions, which they said were the first in more than 25 years, as a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group cuts its North Sea contractors' tariffs by about 9% this year.
The company's tariff reduction is consistent with a 10 per cent reduction in the prices of contractors working in the countries in 20114.
According to the company, the additional cuts will give it the space needed to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut thousands of employees off from her payroll and announced plans to abandon oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, thus seeking to improve its operations after its megafusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Lower crude oil prices and the economic situation resulting from the UK's decision to leave the European Union in June are putting pressure on energy companies.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest industrial conflicts that have been experienced in the North Sea for a whole generation.
According to him, the North Sea is vital to the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and the whole country, we need an economy that benefits many and not just few," Anderson said.
It is expected that less than $1.4 billion will be spent on new North Sea projects in 2016, compared to about $7 billion spent on them in the last five years.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of the stars in the Pleiades star cluster
The latest task of the Kepler space telescope has been to measure the rotation rate of stars, which has helped astronomers to compile the most comprehensive list of spin rates of stars in the Pleiades star cluster so far.
Based on new information, astronomers are able to determine why stars of the same cluster spin at different speeds and how the rotations relate to planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing the results with other star groups, we will learn more about the relationship between the star's weight and age and even about the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, researcher at Caltech University's infrared processing and analysis centre in Pasadena in a press release.
The Pleiades star cluster is 445 light-years from the Earth.
Many of the stars have been born about 125 million years ago, meaning they are just reaching their adult age.
They're spinning faster than ever.
As the rotation rate peaks, large amounts of star wind burst from the growing stars.
These winds have a braking effect on the stars as they progress through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star ages, its spin rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by monitoring the time between the appearance of identifiable starspots (which correspond to sunspots).
The latest listed speed data suggest that larger stars spin slower than smaller ones.
Rebull likens stars to dancers - bigger ones spin slower than smaller ones.
"We see from Pleiades' "dance" that the slow spins are typically larger, while the fastest spins are typically very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades star cluster is so close, it acts as an ideal space laboratory to compare the stars' characteristics with rotation rates.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides a pillar of support for theoretical models of spins of both younger and older stars," Rebull said.
We want to get a lot more information about how, when and why stars slow down their spin rate and stop their "dance."
Rebull and his colleagues present their latest analysis of Pleiades' spin rates in three new articles that will be published shortly in the Astronomical Journal.
