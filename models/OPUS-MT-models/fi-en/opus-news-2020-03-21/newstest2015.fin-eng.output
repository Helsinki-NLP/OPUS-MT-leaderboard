The city of Juankoski will join the city of Kuopio in the beginning of 2017.
Kuopio City Council unanimously approved the union on Monday.
Juankoski City Council approved the union last week.
The municipality of Tuusniemi was also involved in the settlement of the municipal union, but its council decided that Tuusniemi would continue to be independent.
Kuopio and Juankoski decide on the implementation of the next municipal elections separately.
The next municipal election will be held in 2016.
After Juankoski's accession, Kuopio has a population of about 111,000.
India and Japan's prime ministers meet in Tokyo
India's new prime minister Narendra Modi will meet his Japanese colleague Shinzo Abe in Tokyo to discuss economic and security relations during his first major international visit after the May election victory.
Mod's five-day visit to Japan aims to strengthen economic relations with the world's third largest economy.
At the top of the discussion are plans for extended nuclear cooperation.
India has also been said to be interested in a defence cooperation agreement with Japan.
Putin: Ukrainian troops shoot civilians
Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed Kiev's leadership for refusing to conduct direct political talks with the separatists in eastern Ukraine on Monday.
The current Kiev leadership does not want to carry out the essential political dialogue with the eastern part of its country, said Putin, according to the news agency Itar-Tass.
He also said that the Russian-minded separatists, who Kiev and the West say are assisted by the Russian army, tried to push Ukraine's troops further away from their current positions, where Putin said Ukrainian army forces were shooting civilians.
The goal of the militia fighters is to push out these armed forces and their artillery so they don't get the chance to shoot the people in the area, Mr Putin said.
The event took place on Friday and Saturday at the Ryrmi repair shop.
It surprised me that the crowd came from the very beginning of the evening.
The number of visitors was expected in two days, says promoter Tom Kangas.
The Wall River Hiphop Festival was held for the third time.
Next year again.
We are still going to be a hip-hop festival, so pop is not going to happen, Kangas assures.
On Tuesday a law will enter into force in Finland to restrict the purchase of materials suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In the future, individuals will have to apply to the Police Department for permission to purchase or hold substances or mixtures that could be used as a source of explosives, so to speak.
These substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate, and mixtures containing them, if the concentration values are exceeded.
For example, hydrogen peroxide is present in detergents and detergents, but the concentrations do not usually exceed the limit values.
Nitromethane is used, for example, in the acceleration drive.
However, precursors acquired before the entry into force of the Act may be held and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster accused of hotel rapes in Nairn and Pitlochry
The accused of rape in two hotels is facing a trial.
George Webster, 28, heard the charges in a hearing before Glasgow Supreme Court.
He is charged with rape at Pitlochry's Scotland's Hotel in Perthshire province on June 7, 2013.
Webster is accused of attacking a woman "in her unconscious state, in her sleep, and thus unable to make a decision on her own."
Webster is also charged with another rape at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, the Highlands, on May 4, 2014.
According to Judge Lady Rae's decision, the trial will take place on 17 November in Edinburgh at the Supreme Court.
Champion League: Super Raheem shone - Mario was overshadowed - Champion League - Ilta-Sanomat
Only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling once again showed why he is considered a hope for the future of English football.
On Sunday, White Hart Lane had an electric atmosphere when Liverpool, who was strengthened at Mario Balotelli, arrived as a guest of Tottenham.
Super Mario's debut was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian working in the field with a completely different attitude than Manchester City.
Balotelli was still a long way from his top.
The Italian lost three high-quality goals and fed only half of his 16 pitches to his own team.
Pool supporters who have already chosen the player will expect better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers placed Balotelli in the role of Luis Suarez, who travelled to Barcelona, as the team's second attacker alongside Daniel Sturridge.
The star of the team was Raheem Sterling, the tip of the midfield diamond instead of Balotelli, who pushed past Hugo Lloris' important opening goal for a 3-0 win.
Sterling, 19, isn't just brilliant with its power.
The Englishman 20 cents shorter than Balotelli is between the opponent's lines than a fish in the water.
The property is not common to a player who runs at about 34 kilometres per hour on the lawn at best.
Rodgers also deserves great credit for Sterling's development.
After the match, a Northern Irishman told how Liverpool has systematically developed a player more comprehensive than a winger from a northwestern Londoner who grew up at Wembley's foot.
Susanna Mälkki was elected chief conductor of the Helsinki City Orchestra - "I'm happy and proud"
The Helsinki City Board has decided to appoint Susanna Mälkin as the next chief conductor of the Helsinki orchestra since autumn 2016.
The newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times, have asked which orchestra he will take next.
Susanna Mälkki says she will begin her new mission with joy and pride.
Helsinki City Orchestra has played a key role in our country's music life for over a hundred years, for example by performing a large number of Sibelius's music.
The orchestra has been led by the best Finnish conductors and I have worked with many members of the orchestra before.
I look forward to our future cooperation, he says.
Administrations of wage-earner organisations gathered in a matter of pension negotiations - Domestic - Regions - News - Karjalainen
A new impetus is being sought for the pension negotiations today from the social partners' own meetings.
The administrations of wage-earner organisations SAK, Akava and STTK will discuss the negotiating situation in the morning.
After that, the actual pension negotiations will continue.
Labour market organisations have been plagued, among other things, by the dispute about how to tie the retirement age to life expectancy.
The organisations have promised a career solution by autumn, but according to the latest estimate, it would be in the course of this week.
It's a pike.
The Rovaniemi women's volleyball league team, Woman Volley, tripped over the League-edicing Vampula athletes at the Pihtiputa in the finals of the training tournament on Sunday.
The vampula turned five long fights into a 3-2 win.
The final round of WoVo lost 15-11.
The neighbor was always one step ahead.
The fight was good, but in the defense and passport game Vampula was a bit better, WoVo coach Teemu Mäkikyrö saw.
The WoVo spruce was fraught with the fact that Jennifer Keddy, a six-foot-old American center, was stuck on the sidelines.
Sara Niemi played as the center.
Karoliina Kyllönen, despite her thumb injury, was able to play and, with Johanna Pekkarinen, formed WoVo's most powerful combination.
Jenna Keskimäki, who started as a chipper, was allowed to make room for Jana Jaudzema during the last 1.5 rounds.
The best part of the vampula was a skilled Russian pastor and Libero Hillaelina Hämäläinen, who WoVo circled as much as possible.
WoVo's preparations for the league will continue at the turn of next week as Hämeenlinna's HPK comes to a training camp in Rovaniemi.
The team will meet on Saturday at the "store" at 6 pm in an official training game.
On Sunday, there will be a second encounter at the sports academy.
Lidl is beating wild numbers in Finland
The company's Finnish stores' turnover grew by nearly 25 per cent to nearly 1.2 billion euros in the financial year ending at the end of February.
The company released its results on Monday.
Lidl now has 142 stores in Finland, and the expansion will continue.
Lidl also said that he paid nearly 14 million euros in taxes to Finland from the last financial year.
Lidl Finland belongs to the German Lidl Group.
The company has over 4,200 employees in Finland.
Ovarian cancer dies more often in sparsely populated areas due to late diagnosis and complicated access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released the video as a tribute to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia have a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
Researchers reviewed the patient records of more than 1100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35 percent of women lived more than five years after the diagnosis.
Chief researcher Susan Jordan from the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
SMALL RESEARCH: New drugs may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers went through women's health history over seven years.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, the woman's age at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, previous illnesses and socio-economic status also affected the chances of survival.
In older women and when cancer spread more widely at the time of diagnosis, the probability of survival was lowest.
Women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not try to determine why women living outside the city are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers a delayed diagnosis and complicated access to treatment as possible reasons.
"Gynecological oncology specialists treat this disease best, and their receptions are mostly located in large cities," Jordan said.
While teleservice treatments are becoming more common and the distance is less important, the researcher also suggests increasing the mobility of doctors so that specialist doctors can take care of patients closer to their home, as well as programmes to support patients treated far from home.
According to Dr. Jordan's study, women with ovarian cancer have a poor long-term survival rate regardless of geographical location, highlighting the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programmes.
A study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, a 33-year-old housewife in Gold Coast, Elijah Neave, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The city of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen sled parking in Friendship Park, next to Hotel Pohjanhov.
On Monday, the city board decided that the proposal for a station plan for Friendship Park and its surrounding surroundings will be placed on public view at the service point Osviina.
Statements are requested from the Environmental Board and Lapland's ely centre.
With the change in the plan, the city wants to enable the snowmobile activities related to tourism to continue in the area.
A park area is to be formed to include the area between the current Friendship Park and the river.
From 15 November to 30 April, there will be a permanent maximum of 200 snowmobiles.
You can also place refuelling points in a certain part of the area.
Service traffic is also allowed in the new park area.
The city of Rovaniemi has rented the area of Friendship Park to safari companies for snowmobile use during the winter.
The lease was last renewed in spring 2014 and will be valid until spring 2018.
Even loud opposition has been raised by snowmobile parking and the change in pattern.
The residents of neighboring apartment houses have been upset with noise as well as worry about emissions.
However, emissions in the area have been investigated, and there have been no findings beyond the guide values.
The renewed equipment is also lower than the old one.
The friendship park as a parking lot is also supported by the fact that if the starting point were to be moved further away, the hotel safari pigs should be transported to the safari departure points on buses estimated to have 15 departures a day.
According to the city, the area of the friendship park and the surrounding area are also large enough for the sleds, better than the places presented as replacement points of departure, such as the east side of the Ounasjoki bridges, next to the boat pier.
The friendship park is good for its location, even because in the future operations can expand into areas such as Ounaspaviljong.
The establishment of parking activities is part of a city strategy approved by Rovaniemi City Council, according to which the city's goal is, among other things, to create a good framework for business operations by providing sufficient high-quality areas for logistically and functionally affordable locations.
The friendship park has also been marked as a starting point for snowmobileing in the city centre's partial general plan, which has not yet received legal force.
The decrease in owner-occupied housing is visible in garden shops
The reduction in the number of home owners, especially among those under 35, could lead to a tens of millions of sales in garden shops, as young consumers today reach the "main target group" of garden sales for their age.
According to the Financial Times report, tenants spend only 55 per cent of the money they spend on gardening.
The study also showed that more and more people live in highly urbanised apartments without gardens, and the size of the garden will be reduced as the front yard is increasingly paved for parking, and these factors also threaten the garden sector, which is estimated to be worth about £5 billion a year.
In London's major area, property ownership has fallen from 61 to 43 per cent in six years, where gardening products are the least used per household in the country.
However, according to HTA and the British Garden Association (RHS), the increase in housing rental or the decrease in the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
According to RHS' leading garden advisor Guy Barter, "for example, plants grown in mobile breeding vessels are especially popular among tenants, since such breeding vessels can be included in the move if necessary."
According to HTA's report, the years 1997-2005 were the booming season of garden sales, as housing ownership and wealth increased from the late 80s to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that the trade will pick up this year due to better weather conditions, worse than last year's weather in March and April.
Turkey interrogates a U.S. diplomat for a spy report
The Turkish State Department has invited the country's most experienced U.S. diplomat to report a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Bulent, the U.S. embassy administrator and Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
German newspaper Der Spiegel and online newspaper The Intercept have written that documents leaked by former analyst Edward Snowden from the National Security Agency (NSA) reveal that Turkey was the main spy of U.S. and UK intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the significance of the report, saying that all major states have been spying on each other.
The previous report on the espionage of Ankara by Germany's main intelligence service brought about a more angry reaction in the Turkish government.
Cannes winner Croze performs in a new Finnish film
Canadian actress Marie-Josée Croze, who performed in several successful films, has been attached to the leading female in the new Finnish film.
Croze plays in director Mikko Kuparinen's film for 2 nights in the morning, which starts shooting this week in Lithuania.
Croze won Cannes' best female lead in her role in the Barbarian invasion in 2003.
He has performed, among other things, in Steven Spielberg's film Munich and Julian Schnabel's film Perhonen's glass dome.
Mikko Nousiainen is the leading man in 2 nights to morning.
The film will have its premiere in Finland in September 2015.
Majorcan Magaluf police chief charged with corruption
The people who reported the incident presented evidence of extortion by police officers and city officials in the District Attorney's Office in Mallorca on Friday.
The Chief of Police of Calvià, located on Mallorca Holiday Island, has been arrested for damp partying as a result of allegations of corruption made by shop owners and bar owners in the known Magaluf area.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was placed in custody after several shop owners on Punta Ballena Street filed corruption charges against him, and most of Magaluf bars and nightclubs are located on Punta Ballena Street.
According to an online daily newspaper Mallorca Diario, those reporting the incident presented evidence of extortion by police and city officials in the office of the District Attorney's Office for the Anti-Corruption of Mallorca on Friday.
The other two local police officers were arrested by the Spanish National Guard in connection with corruption charges and are being questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
The country-wide daily ABC wrote about the anger of nightclub owners about the bias of the authorities, which significantly complicated their business.
"It's not money anymore, it's survival," one shop owner said to the court.
You will not destroy our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was on the headlines in several countries this summer, as a YouTube video spread online, where an 18-year-old British holidayer had oral sex with 24 men during a so-called pub crawl.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to curb the drunken and uncontrolled behaviour of Magaluf holidaymakers by reducing the number of participants in infamous, alcoholic pub crawlies.
In addition, the Playhouse nightclub, where the oral sex video was filmed, was ordered to be closed for a year, and the club owner and pub crawl organiser Carnage were jointly fined EUR 55,000.
Especially among young British tourists, the popular Magaluf tourist attraction has also become popular with the so-called balconing trend, which has caused a number of alcohol-related accidents when people have jumped from balcony to balcony or from balcony to hotel pool.
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters as rockets and mortars bombed their communities during the 50-day Israel-Hamas war, and schools remained closed as the region recovered from the fighting.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in rocket-bombed communities in southern Israel, but the signs of battle are still visible.
In the southern town of Ashdod in Pashosh, the workers removed shrapnel tracks from the walls and slided before the children arrived after the rocket hit the day care centre.
"We're a bit scared, but also excited," says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbutz called Saad, an Israeli community, and works as an English teacher at a school in the city.
Many children living in this area are in desperate need of routines.
Bart's 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, thinks that going back to school after a long time is "a bit weird."
"We have had difficult times at times when we didn't leave home," he said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Before the cease-fire last week, thousands of people from border communities like Saad had stayed indoors or left their homes for safer areas away from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many of the residents of the Nahal Oz community near the Gaza front are suspicious of the return of the Palestinian grenade after killing a 4-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, more than ten families had not yet returned.
The children of these families have so far been placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city near the Gaza border, where heavy Palestinian fire was being carried out.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that "the education and safety of children will be taken care of."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The cease-fire immediately halted the fighting, but it did not provide a solution to a number of key issues, such as Hamas' call for the lifting of the Israeli-Egypt blockade and the reopening of Gaza's air and sea routes.
Israel wants to disarm Hamas and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
Egypt is expecting the start of a new round of indirect negotiations later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of dead, saying that at least half of the dead were soldiers, though it has not had solid proof of this.
66 soldiers and six civilians died on the Israeli side, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gaza soldiers shot 4,591 rockets and grenades in Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
Israel's army, on the other hand, carried out over 5,000 air strikes and other attacks.
Israel's attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250 000 people fled to shelter at more than 100 UN schools that had been turned into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people were still protected and fighting continued, school officials moved the beginning of school the week before.
"I hope the school opens soon and we can go back to school, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children," said 13-year-old Mohammad Amara, who lives in a sheltered school in the city of Gaza.
According to a commonly used indicator, housing prices have risen most in seven years during Australia's winter months.
The price index of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic dwellings, which measures the prices of Australian capital housing, rose by 1.1 per cent in August, was found in RP data on Monday.
With the rise, prices rose in June, July and August to a total of 4.2 per cent, i.e. more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, which is more than twice as high as in the 12 months before August 2013, but prices have not risen steadily across the country.
According to RP Data research director Tim Lawless, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the price rise.
RP Data results show that housing prices went up 16.1% in Sydney and 11.7 percent in Melbourne the year before.
Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin's housing market is next the busiest; the average price increase is between 5 and 6 per cent.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by just 1.4 per cent a year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring that began in Australia will increase the number of apartments for sale in the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
"In view of the rise in the sales of the apartments to be auctioned, the generally high pace of sales and the continuing low interest rates, it is likely that the rise in the prices of the dwellings will continue over the next three months," Lawless said.
The new Gösta Museum has drawn record audiences to Mänttä
The new museum and visual arts have attracted record audiences to Mänttä this summer.
By the end of August, there have been over 70,000 visitors to the Serlachius Art Museum.
The new Gösta Museum was opened in June and has featured classic works of pop art from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, among others.
Mänttä's Fine Arts Weeks said on Monday that they had made a visitor's record, after 14 500 people had visited the Waiting Party this summer.
These numbers have not been used to.
People have stopped from the doors and windows," says Director Pauli Sivonen from the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the number of visitors to the Serlachius Museums will be close to 100,000 this year.
In previous years, there have been about 40,000 visitors.
Mänttä-Vilppula, located in the middle of Tampere and Jyväskylä, has about 11,000 inhabitants.
Museum director Sivonen reminds that new museums are always phenomena when they open up.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he said.
In Mänttä, it is hoped that the art season will go a long way through the summer.
In the autumn, new exhibitions will be opened at the art museum.
Police are investigating four thefts in Kajaani in recent days.
On Sunday night in Pohjolankadu, a window was broken into the commercial property.
The unsub had received a small amount of money from the cash register.
Between Thursday and Monday, there was fuel stolen from the truck's tank on Syväojankatu.
On the other hand, between Sunday and Monday, the boat and its outboard engines had been taken from the boat harbour of the double neck.
The rowing boat was light on the outside and yellowish on the inside.
On the inside, it said "OIVA" on the beak.
A couple of suspects were already caught by the police.
On Sunday night, a commercial property was broken into in Tikkapurontie.
The police dog got a trace and a 20-year-old Paltamoman was found hiding under a tree in the woods.
On Monday, the police caught another man in Paltamo who is also suspected of committing the same burglary.
Missing amphetamines brought a murder charge in Kajaani
The disappearance of less than 10 grams of amphetamines brought a murder charge to a Kajaan man born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, the man had gone to the apartment with his cohabiting partner and another man and shot the owner of an apartment he suspected to be a drug taker, a 34-year-old Kajaan woman.
The defendant denied the charge and claimed that the other man with him was the shooter.
The incident came to the police's attention when a police patrol stopped a passenger car where a party was burning clothes used in blood work.
In addition to the burnt clothes, a cut-off shotgun was found in the car.
Kainuu District Court will pass judgment on the matter later.
August was unusually warm in many places.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, the same warm August is repeated on average once in ten years.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute's statistics show that the average temperature in the whole country was higher than usual.
In most parts of the country, the deviation was one to two degrees.
Due to the heat in July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature of the whole summer was measured in Pori in the first week of August, where the meter showed 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says: My father never hugged me.
He never said he loved me
Henry was born into a seven-child Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley in the British Midlands region in 1958.
Henry's father worked at the factory and died when he was 19, and the boy and father had a distant relationship.
Henry is currently practicing for Rudy's Rare Records, a comedy show that is partly based on imaginary conversation with his father and has been developed on the basis of a series of Radio 4 channels.
The audio track is a mix of reggae and rap at upbeat speeds.
Henry has had to go through painful childhood memories.
She has been in therapy several times since her mother died, and she thinks a lot about her relationship with her father.
It was very difficult to read the father.
His face was never visible, only a voice said: stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I'm looking at cricket now.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, went to the pub with my father to discuss, for example, the shape of a beer sheath or the beauty of cricket batting.
I never spoke to him about such things.
For most of my life, he was the smileless man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal smelter shop in Dudley to get an idea of what his father's life must have been like, even though the working conditions are better now than they were then.
The smelters are a bit brighter these days, but they are practically dark, smoky, labyrinth-like depths with flames, smoke and soot that remind me of hell.
Father used to take a bath and just lie in the bathtub, and slowly he started singing by himself as he washed the dirt from the smelter.
As I walked around the smelter, I realized that he had been working for years to get us food on the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry's childhood lacked the closeness of his parents.
My father never hugged me or said he loved me.
It wasn't until my mother started to get sick a little before she died that we started repeating that we love each other.
Henry has a daughter, Billie, with Dawn French, and through her own child, she has been able to share the love she herself lacked as a child.
Do you have to keep saying, "I love you"?
Will you stop hugging me?
Dad, I'm 22!
Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry is still a good friend with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to Mother's death.
When I began to suffer from heavy overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to turn around.
After that, I started to exercise a lot, and I also had to start a heavy diet to reduce the symptoms.
It's very difficult –
And boring.
No one enjoys eating carrots.
Henry's well-known, short beard perhaps describes his change during career development.
Having received a lot of good feedback from critics about his role as Othello, he is absorbed in making a theatre.
Next was the comedy of Mistakes and the Fences of August Wilson ("Aidat").
Making the theatre offers a different experience than the sitcoms and comedy that Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry started in the industry when he was only 16 years old, a factory employee.
A DJ spotted him on stage doing impressions and contacted the New Faces talent competition.
Henry's TV career began in the mid-70s. "For quite a long time, I was the only black imitator and comedian on TV," he said.
Henry learned when he was working.
I had to grow up in the spotlight of publicity, I had to learn to make jokes about the assembly line between 1975 and 1985, while I was living in stardom and on television, and it was a difficult time.
Lenny New Faces in 1975
Henry's manager had stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment show where people appeared black in makeup, so Henry ended up as a comedian for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never taken part in it, but I do not regret it.
Even though my position was strange and reprehensible, I got to work at huge events and learn how to deal with the audience.
Still, "British TV's award-winning, multi-year favourite and light entertainment show" was also "a grotesque parody of black people."
Henry worked in another comedy series in the '80s, where both joked and admired black British culture.
The Lenny Henry Show's first episode was shown in 1984, and in the 90s Henry was known for his character as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
Henry spent the next decade on ads, documentaries, TV shows and film parts, but after his show LennyHenry.tv in the BBC in 2008, he said to himself: "What are you going to do next, Len - now it looks like you're just trampling on your spot or going on sidetracks."
Next came the Radio 4 documentary series "What's So Great About?".
In the first part, Shakespeare was discussed.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It wasn't really taught us properly at school, and I think it belonged to the white middle class, who wears tights and has money.
That's why Shakespeare raised fear in me.
All the people we interviewed on the show - Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench - said to me: "Try.
Don't abandon the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
Date words and understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry uttered 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he had been sold.
I felt like I could do this.
It almost felt like a part of me was missing earlier, and now it was put in place.
"This is what it's about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your verse, do a little background research.
So the training process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was carried out.
The play was finally a success.
Apparently it was expected to fail, but not quite so.
Soon after, Henry played the lead in the comedy of Mistakes.
Suddenly I played in the British National Theatre, and I couldn't quite believe it.
At one point I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
On one occasion there were technical problems in the play, and Henry clearly felt it was his job to entertain the audience.
"A little voice in my mind said to me, 'You have to do 10 minutes alone until the computer works again.'"
Instead, the director's assistant announced that the performance will be continued as soon as the problem has been resolved.
I walked out of the stage, and a part of me sighed with relief.
It's not my duty,
I can leave it to others.
"You're part of the play, stay in the role"
Henry "Fences" at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the lines to the "Fences" play was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes people more durable.
This play was also well received, so it was like a sign from the gods, "This is what you have to do."
This, of course, is what Henry says with a KUMMALY voice.
So I decided to stick to this.
I sincerely love this job.
I love training rooms.
Henry, however, is still basically a comedian: our conversations are constantly interrupted by small pups of humor as he trades between impressions.
Abstention from stand-up comedy is a matter of will, as getting immediate thanks from an unknown audience seems dangerous.
If you keep thirsting for it, it can lead to a dead end.
I sometimes spend a lot of time at the Apollo theatre when I feel that way, but generally it doesn't inspire me the way I used to.
I'll ask Henry if he's going on another stand-up tour.
It gives me real joy to sit with the director, who will help shape the beginning, middle and end of the journey, and I don't think I ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new rebirth?
I think so.
I like acting -
It's really funny.
The story is constantly told during the performance, and that's something I like to do.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya is drawing up a register of officials to remove "ghost workers"
Kenya has begun to draw up a biometric register of civil servants in an attempt to remove "ghost workers" from the government's payroll.
Employees who did not sign up for the register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, the government announcement announced.
The government suspects that thousands will continue to be paid after leaving office.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to eradicate public sector corruption after taking office in 2013.
According to an audit earlier this year, at least one million dollars was spent a month on the wages and other financial abuses of 'ghost workers'.
The government suspects that wages will be paid into the account even after the person has died or left his post, the BBC's Wanyama Chebusiri report on the capital, Nairobi.
All officials will have to register themselves in the identification centres in the next few weeks to ensure that their data is recorded in biometric form, as reported in the Government's press release.
According to the press release, anyone who fails to do this for no proper reason will be removed from the payroll.
"This measure significantly rationalises the public sector because it defines how many people really work in their duties, and it also clears pay lists at both levels of the government, solving the problem of "ghost workers", says Anne Waiguru, an official at the cabinet of the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
Seinäjoki's profit for the financial year 2015 could be EUR 25.5 million in deficit, unless the city adjusts its operations and expenditure development in a tight economic climate.
Based on the current budget preparation, the annual margin is about 9.4 million in deficit.
Possible ways of improving efficiency were to cut back on the scope and level of services, as well as the purchase of services, the sale of property and subsidies, and the increase in revenue from taxes and payments.
The investment target of EUR 10 million is 8.5 million.
There will be no relief for the municipalities.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, the inadequate increase in tax revenue, increasing unemployment and a five per cent cut in state shares further weaken the outlook.
The purpose of the economic seminar is to find new ways to balance the economy.
The city government is unanimous that savings must be made.
The ship must be turned to the goal of the strategy, says Kimmo Heinonen, president of the city board.
The city board returned the proposals made to the management team to be prepared.
The city council's proposals are the basis for budget preparation at the council's financial seminar in Fram on Monday, September 8.
After the council seminar, the budget proposal progresses through board processing to the city council and city council.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested as suspects against "conspiracy" government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey as suspects of "an anti-government plot", local media sources report.
Police officials did not comment immediately.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, there were 14 high-ranking police officers among those arrested.
Some of the police were in contact with corruption investigations last December, targeting government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey on charges of organising a large criminal gang and tracking telephones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who served as Prime Minister during that time) said police action was part of the planned action against him and other in power by Islamist leader Fethullah Gullen.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most of the schools in Ukraine opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This is a traditionally significant day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told expectant journalists that not all schools have reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The ceremonies of the first day of September were not held in every school.
There is no peace in the whole of Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the whole huge Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukhov, who is a leading teacher at Slavianski school, where Yatsenyuk's daughter goes, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally return here and that children will be able to learn something that will benefit them in the future.
The celebrations of the first day of school traditionally include children's written shirts, balloons, and giving flowers to teachers.
According to Perry, Texas, the defamatory tweet was trespassing.
On Sunday evening, a defamatory photo of a Democratic district attorney was sent from the confirmed Twitter account of Texas governor Rick Perry during a hearing of allegations of abuse of power.
The tweet was later removed, followed by a new tweet where Perry swore he had nothing to do with the picture.
The Tweet was sent illegally from my account.
"I don't approve of tweet and I've deleted it," the later publication said.
Perry's backup forces did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.
Although tweets were sent from Perry's confirmed Twitter account, it is unclear who posted the photo.
The first tweet contained a defamatory cartoon of Travis' district attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunken driving in April 2013.
Perry blocked Lehmberg's post when he refused to resign, which led to a grand jury meeting in Austin this month, when Perry was accused, and Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
The title of the Tweet was: "I don't always drive drunk, three times as high as I can... but when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for pointing fingers."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office did not lead a grand jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antonio who was assigned by a Republican judge.
Perry has said he is innocent and called the accusations a political plot.
His influential legal aid team has asked the judge handling the case to reject the charges and said that the law on the basis of which the governor in Texas's longest office is accused is unclear, mirrored against the constitution.
Perry cut $7.5 million in state subsidies to the state's public inviolability unit, which operates in Travis County and handles public sector accusations when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision led a left-wing follow-up group to file a formal complaint.
Perry's confirmed Twitter account is regularly updated – and sometimes also famously.
After gaining fifth place at the Iowa election meeting during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to end the tie by publishing a picture of himself on Twitter running around the lake with the text "Here I come, South Carolina!"
Berkeley said the housing market is "normal" again
One of London's most important builders has warned that the housing market in south-eastern England has "returned" to normal activity levels.
The capital of London's apartments have been plagued by huge demand and steep price rises, while the widespread credit bubble has been feared, causing the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgages in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of a high-level developer Berkeley, said on Monday that "since the beginning of the current economic year, the market and the number of shops have returned to normal since the spike in 2013" and added that this has allowed a "stable operating environment".
During the recession, the London housing market went well as foreign investors tried to reach the capital by herd.
According to the land register, housing prices in the city rose by 18.5 per cent just the previous year, well above the average in England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
Berkeley's average selling prices for private, affordable and student buildings rose by about a fifth in the previous year, reaching a price rise of £423,000 by the end of April.
However, the strengthened pound has made London's real estate a less attractive destination in recent months - some of the interest has also been influenced by new property tax laws and political rhetoric about a possible "tart tax" before the May general election.
London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage report, which reported more stringent quotes, would lead to a lower level of market growth both in terms of sales volumes and prices in the second half of the year.
The latest information from the Bank of England showed on Monday that the number of approved loans dropped in July, suggesting a cooling housing market.
Real estate agent Hamptons International has decreased its 2015 forecast for London real estate prices, according to which prices will fall by three per cent, since the index of houseowners' views on prices has already begun to weaken.
The number of shops in London's most expensive areas, Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has dropped by a quarter to a year ago, says real estate agent WA Ellis.
However, the demand for homes in the capital is a blessing to Berkeley, who increased the income from the properties sold to over £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that "the demand for a well-designed, right kind of product in the best locations has remained stable and thus sales have remained active."
In June, the company said it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year before April, almost a third more than at the peak before the economic crisis in 2007.
The annual pre-tax profits rose by 40 per cent to £380 million one year ago and the turnover increased by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
On Monday, before the company's annual meeting, Pidgley said that Berkeley's earnings match current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the pre-tax profit for the whole year is £450 million.
Berkeley stock sold evenly on the London stock exchange for £23.96 in the afternoon.
The hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence's nude photos online
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards ceremony.
A hacker who claims to hold photos of a hundred other stars leaked Oscar actor Jennifer Lawrence's naked pictures online.
A representative of the Star Hunger confirmed that the images are authentic and condemned the hacker for "an insolent violation of privacy."
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes Jennifer Lawrence's stolen photos will be charged.
The images originally published on the 4chan image release page had apparently fallen into the wrong hands because of the weakness of Apple's iCloud storage system, and it is claimed that there are dozens of other female stars on the list of hundreds of other hacked stars, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed said.
It is not known how much of the photos are authentic, though Scott Pilgrim versus World Star Winstead condemned hacking on Twitter.
"For those who watch pictures taken by me and my husband in the privacy of our home years ago: I hope you feel good," Winstead tweeted.
But Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and "Victorious" shows denied the authenticity of the images and tweeted that "these so-called nude pictures of me are WRONG, don't you understand?"
Let me finish this in the beginning.
BuzzFeedin announced late Sunday that a pop star Ariana Grande spokesman denied the authenticity of the pictures about the star.
Only we have an extract of Howard Jacobson's praise for a new novel about love and letter "J"
They dissolved, it was the best description of what happened, and gradually they were separated from each other like a cardboard box left in the rain.
Only once in a while did she hear from the woman that she was too serious, hard-working, intense, detached, and perhaps also a bit thorny.
That's when he waved his hand.
He recognized the spike.
Yes, he was stingy, like a hedgehog.
The latest victim of her spikes had been in an early relationship, but it had been promising; it had seemed that this relationship could have helped her to be lonely and could have even brought some substance to her life.
Ailinn Solomons had untamed hair and was a delicately delicate beauty with a joyous heart from a northern village that was even harsher and farther away from everything than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older traveling companion, who Kevern assumed to be her aunt, an aunt who inherited a house in a damp but paradisaic valley, and the name of the valley was fittingly called Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
The pipes were leaking, there were spiders in all the bathrooms, snails had left their mark on the windows, holding the whole place as their own, weeds grew in the garden that resembled giant cabbage heads.
The cottage was like a children's fairy tale, at the same time threatening and magical, a garden full of secrets.
The author said: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is nominated for the Booker Literature Prize in 2014.
The nominations will be published next week
Kevern had sat hand in hand with Ailinn on a broken terrace chair in the middle of a long haystack, enjoying a surprisingly warm afternoon in the spring, both listening to a scattering receiver through which the whole country heard soothing music and calming news as the crossed sun-tanned feet of Ailinni reminded him of a song sung by a long-forgotten black performer and his father had often listened to the blinds of the cottage below.
Your leg is too big.
Such songs were basically too aggressive and were no longer played in the receiver.
They had not been banned - nothing was actually banned - they just weren't played anymore.
They were wanted to be forgotten, as was the word unhola itself.
Public opinion did what the laws and decrees had not achieved: just as people in the literature chose heroes' memoirs, cookbooks and romances to read, they favoured ballads in music.
With the wildness of the day, Kevern began to dial the imaginary piano and sing serenadia to Ailinn's big feet with a boldly comical voice.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"It was a famous song by jazz pianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, while naturally raising two fingers in front of his mouth.
This was what his father had always done before the letter "J" could escape his lips.
It had begun as a game between him and Dad when he was small.
His father said he played the same game with his own father.
If you let the word that starts with a j out of your mouth and you didn't remember to lift two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn't a very funny game then, and it wasn't now.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn had never heard such a thing.
Jazz wasn't actually banned, either, it just wasn't played.
Improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was only room for one "if" word in life.
When the song began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same thing happened to cleverness.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was the wit of music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10, jazz music had become familiar to him through his father's semi-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailinn Fats Waller was black.
Given Ailinn's age, it was likely that he did not remember the time when the popular singers were not black.
Here, too, there was no need for laws or coercion.
Obedient society meant that each of its parts was grateful - grateful, for having been saved like luck - for the principle that each group did the things that were natural to it.
Based on their temperament and physical characteristics, people with African-Caribbean genealogy are best suited to entertain and exercise, so they sang and ran.
Originally, those from the Indian continent were like naturally talented with electrical equipment, so it was up to them to make sure that every family had a working phone that was used to handle things.
Those remaining from the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke plates.
When what happened, IF IT happened, those from the Gulf and the Middle East, whose grandparents had not fled quickly in fear of being accused of burning flames and fearing that the flames would catch them next, opened restaurants that served labneh yogurt and burned water pipe, and continued their lives looking down and depressed.
Let each one act according to his talents.
Ailinn had only heard ballads, and it was hard for him to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung could ever have been dressed as music.
Love was expressed through music.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe for the bigfooters.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created an illusion of security.
No word would pass through the soundproofing of giant cabbage head leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to put two fingers to his lips with Ailinn.
Ailinn thought he was weird already.
"My father thought it was funny," he said instead.
Ailinn shook her head in disbelief, and her hair covered Kevern's field of vision.
Nothing else to see in the whole world but Ailinn's huge, crow-black hairbrush.
That's all he wanted to see.
"If you say so," he said, but he didn't sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
Ailinn seemed genuinely confused.
Are my legs that big?
He looked again.
Your legs aren't really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was still too early for that.
"I find you attractive because of your thick ankles," she tried to fix the situation.
I'm twisted in that sense.
This didn't help.
He'd wanted it to sound like fun.
Often, when he wanted to be funny, the effect was quite different, because he, like his father, lacked the convincing charm to control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite his gentle eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and got up from his terrace chair and knocked over the receiver and spilled the wine they had just been drinking.
The wine, too, had been made only from celery flowers, so he could not use it as a reason for the collision.
In his nervousness, he seemed to shake like a palm tree leaves in a storm.
"And your thick head is what I am attracted to in you twistedly," he said...
Except I don't feel that way.
Kevern felt sorry for Ailinn, both because of his own, unnecessarily cruel words, and because of the fear that appeared in his eyes at the moment that Ailinn decided to stand up to him.
Did Ailinn think he'd hit you?
He had never told Kevern about life in the icy northern archipelago, where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that it had basically been like life here.
The same huge, icy sea that waved against them.
The same confused men, though even more pale and diabolical after the incident than their smuggler and deportant grandparents, wandered from the pub to the pub, ready to beat every woman who dared to resist or tease them.
Thick head?
He would still see a thick fist if he wasn't careful!
Suck first - kissing had become the most common word for an erotic encounter between a man and a woman; the antidote for the meaningless love ballads pumping out the receiver - suck first and then attack.
Kevern thought that was too much, because the sucking in itself was already hostile.
Ailin Solomons' body language told him to leave.
He pulled himself out of the terrace chair like an old man.
Ailinn also felt exhausted, but he was surprised by the depth of Kevern's grief.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn watched him go, just as his traveling companion watched Kevern go from the upstairs window, a man who was the reason for his heavy life.
Adam leaving the garden, he wondered.
He was feeling sorry for Kevern and the men in general, even though some of them had raised their hands against him to strike.
A man who had turned his back, bowed down, ashamed, beaten and lost all the will to fight - why did he feel that he was so familiar with that vision, even though he did not remember that he had ever seen it before this moment?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A 32-year-old scientist Esme Nussbaum, who worked in a private institution that measures public opinion in Ofnow, did a short study of the continued low- and medium-level violence in areas of the country where the reduction, or even the end, of the violence was most likely, taking into account the money and energy used to eradicate it.
"A lot has already been done, and much still remains to be done," he wrote, "in order to compensate for the natural aggressiveness of a people who have fought for thousands of years and most often won, especially in those abandoned and remote parts, where, despite the church towers over hedges, humanity has rarely been known over time.
Some things, however, cannot be completely removed.
The higher the tower, the lower its impulses.
The people cry among sentimental ballads, devour the stories of overcome adversities, swearing in the name of the virtues of marriage and family life, but at the same time the old-fashioned cruelty holds persistently in its grip on both rural communities and urban community areas, and there is evidence of a new, more evil-souled fight in homes, workplaces, on our streets and even in playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to dramatise," his director commented after reading the full report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum put her eyes on the ground.
I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme continued to appeal to her right not to answer personal questions.
A feminist?
Once again, silence.
"I don't ask," Luther Rabinowitz said, "because I'm opposed to atheism, lesbian sexuality and feminism.
There are no prejudices in this workplace.
We are servants of an open-minded society.
While a certain kind of hypersensitivity is perfectly acceptable and respectful in itself, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, such as what you just presented to me.
Clearly you have something against the church - and what you call cruelty or evil-souling, others usually call natural energy and physical strength.
To say what happened, IF it happened, as if it happened yesterday, if it happened at all, destroys the earth's fundamental vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind Rabinowitz's head, the flamingon-pink LED light proclaimed a guideline that Ofnow had already distributed to the country for a quarter or more of the previous century.
Smile for your neighbor, value your partner, listen to the ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, chat, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence and the sung word is better than written, but nothing beats love.
"I understand what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum replied in a quiet voice when she was sure her director had finished, "and I just want to say that we are not as effectively healed as we imagine ourselves to be.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will find ourselves repeating the same mistakes that originally led to SILEN'S what happened if it happened.
True, this time we will not shed our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "as you describe 'mistakes' as what our grandparents may have done or not done.
You also go too far when you say they poured out their 'hate and mistrust on others'."
A person like you should not be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we are not talking about 'us' or 'them'.
There was no 'us' or 'the others'.
It was a time of chaos, that's all we know about it.
"If we are completely honest, in that chaos," Esme ventured to continue, "no group in society can say that they have behaved well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done was done, be it good or bad.
That's when it was.
There is no need to talk about it - that is something we agree on.
And just as it is unnecessary to share accusations, there is no need to make corrections, whether they are justified or not, and even if there is a way of making them.
But what is the past for, then, if you don't learn from it --
The past exists so that we can forget about it.
If I may add one more thing --
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'm going over your report," he said, saying it was time for Esme to leave.
The next day, when he went to work as usual, he was hit by a motorcycle driver on the sidewalk, whose driving was described by passersby as "bad-souled and furious."
Coincidence happens.
Lesotho's army forbids planning the attack; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Lesotho military officials have denied staged the government's overthrow and said they were acting against a police officer suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country saying the army had surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in Maseru, the capital.
The head of state and his family travelled to neighboring South Africa after telling him he had received a death threat.
The military representative, Major Ntle Ntoi, denied the attack and said the army responded in this way to a threat from "political fanatics", who have been said to have tried to arm fanatics.
"Lesotho's defence forces took action after receiving several intelligence reports that some police forces are trying to arm young party fanatics when they are ready to cause problems," he told Voice of America news agency.
According to Clayson Monyela, president of the South African Government, the military's actions looked like a revolutionary attempt.
"Even though no party has claimed to have overturned the government by force, the actions of Lesotho's defence forces seem to be fully consistent with the signs of a revolutionary attempt," he said.
According to Lesotho military officials, the soldiers return to their barracks on Sunday, and the capital had a calm atmosphere.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will lead the government in the absence of Thabane.
Thabane says he believes that he is the target of action because he has tried to fight corruption.
There have been tensions in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to disagreements between the government of the great coalition.
He thus denies that he has underestimated the power of the government, even though it is claimed otherwise.
Kauppalehti: Microsoft to set up a data centre in Uusimaa
The IT company Microsoft has set up a large data centre in a location in Uusimaa that the company refuses to specify.
In a statement sent to the media by Microsoft, the company states that it does not indicate the location of all its data centres for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the centre is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It is an investment of several hundred million dollars for Microsoft.
In public, Oulu or Kajaan had previously been the place of the centre.
Microsoft will complete its Oulu office, which will take away about 500 people.
In all, Microsoft has announced that it will terminate up to 1,050 jobs in Finland.
Microsoft Communications Director Camilla Lindfors says to STT that the company does not comment on how many employees the new data centre employs.
Kauppalehti told about the establishment of a data centre in Uusimaa on Monday.
A man accused of beating a girl in a traffic light crossing
A 78-year-old man is charged with running over a three-year-old girl at a traffic light crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart is charged with running over a girl at a crossroads in Pittenween, Eastern Neuk.
According to prosecutors, Stewart drove his Audi Q3 car carelessly and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78 from Anstruther, denied the charges at Dundee Sheriff's Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC ordered the trial to be held in January.
Four tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to take pictures or video underwater, you have several different devices options to choose from.
The cheapest option is a water-resistant, compact point-and-shoot camera like Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action camera like GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which cost about $300.
I myself took these photos at the family party using several different cameras, each of which cost less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules that are worth following.
Always double-check your device.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery and other parts of the camera are waterproofly closed.
In addition, set the camera's description settings to match the images or video to be taken.
Some cameras or combinations of camera and video camera have a setting that optimises underwater film conditions.
In addition - before you jump into the water, make sure how deep your device can be.
Some cameras can only take 5 feet, others can take 50-60 feet.
Check out both normal and waterproof models in our purchase guide and digital camera reviews.
Take several pictures - many of them fail in some way.
The compact cameras have an LCD display that allows you to compose the image, while the action cameras often don't have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it's hard to see underwater, and the composition of the picture can either succeed or fail.
So take several pictures.
If your camera also allows for branching, which means taking multiple images at once with different settings, use this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light will decrease significantly deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface while shooting in the pool, lake or sea.
This will also give you more colors; the deeper you go, the less colors you see.
Try to get close to the target to be photographed.
This is important advice when filming on land, but even more important under water, because light conditions are scarce.
It is very important when an action camera is used: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of view, meaning the camera has to be close to the target to fill the whole picture up to the frames.
China will not allow Hong Kong to choose its leaders - protesters swear revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese parliament decided that Hong Kong voters are not allowed to choose candidates for the 2017 elections despite the growing unrest that calls for democratic reform.
The decision will probably spark the long-awaited protests of Hong Kong's business block after activists began planning and implementing demonstrations only hours after the decision was published.
The Chinese People's Congress's decision basically gives Communists the power to eradicate all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
"This was to be expected, but it is still exasperating," said Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They've lied to the Hong Kongers.
It is clear that we are dealing with an autocratic regime.
Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Congress Committee, defended the Chinese administration, saying that the general nomination of the Hong Kong leader would be too "chaotic."
From 1997 onwards, when Great Britain handed over Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised the residents of the region that it would be allowed to choose its own leader from 2017 onwards.
According to Chinese leaders, Sunday's decision was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but it also makes it clear that China wants to strictly control the electoral process through an appointment committee that is managed from Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be accepted.
The summer before the decision, Hong Kong organised some of the biggest and most prominent protests in the region for years.
The campaign for democracy was largely backed by Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organisers have threatened to block the business block if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong a genuine universal right to vote.
On Sunday night, just hours after the decision was published, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong's main government buildings.
In the demonstration, the organisers announced that the movement would move to a new era of civil disobedience and create protest waves in the coming weeks.
They did not, however, give details, apparently fearing that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In a press release online, the organisers said the movement "considers Occupy Central as a last resort, which will only be introduced if there is no hope of dialogue and there is no other way."
We are very sorry to announce that today's last chance for dialogue has been broken and the invasion of the centre will take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday security measures were tight near the government's main buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, unrest is fueled by the feeling that people are slowly losing control of their city.
The wave of those from the mainland has created competition for products and services.
There is also the fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are disappearing under Beijing's increasing pressure.
Some have criticised the Occupy Central movement because its demonstrations threaten Hong Kong's survival - the business world.
"The protest they're talking about can lead to huge financial losses, depending on how many people take part in it and how long it lasts," says the legislator Regina Ip, who has long criticised the movement.
We do not want there to be any concern that Hong Kong is slipping away from our grip.
Such an image would be bad for investment.
There have also been stories in China's state media that Hong Kong's democracy activists are the minions of the Western powers that fuel the revolution."
This summer, activists organised an informal referendum on voting rights involving 780 000 people - more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest demonstrations in the region in favour of democracy.
The US prom tradition strikes British universities: private jets for new students
We are excited to meet the demand by setting up Britain's first luxury form of travel for today's students.
In addition to a private plane, the company also offers other vehicles, such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, to ensure the most memorable entry to the university.
Stewart said there is also a security aspect to the service.
The service is the best possible option for students who would otherwise drag their property across the country in cars loaded to the limit.
When this is combined with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to offer today's students as easy and high-quality transport as possible to the university.
According to the company representative, no reservations have yet arrived because the service has just been established, but added that "students will start making orders over the next few weeks."
The company believes there is a demand for the service, even though most students pay £9,000 a year.
Today's students are very different from those who started their studies 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of their expectations and hopes, and now it is more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is just the way to do it.
However, the national student organisation criticises a service that is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, vice-chairman of the organisation's university section, "this service plan seems to be a long way from the life of the student majority."
Many this month's studies begin to be shocked at the level of living costs, as the financial support available in the form of loans and grants has fallen behind the huge increase in basic living costs, and only next time can one begin to wonder where to find thousands to be used for something as simple as getting on campus.
Ipswich's "pig house" for sale
Real estate agents removed the sales image of a house on sale in Suffolk after finding that a big pig is lying in the house's living room.
A one-bedroom house with a price of £120,000 is located on a private road in Ipswich.
The ad included a picture of the living room where the pig leaned on the couch.
According to real estate agent Connells, the pig in the picture is the owner's pet.
"However, the photo ended up in the ad by mistake and has since been removed," the company's spokesman said.
In the ad, Connells describes the former meeting house as "a unique one-bedroom house."
Even though real estate has removed the image from its website, it still appears in ads.
The sale of the house has attracted interest in social media, where questions have been asked whether the pig is included in the price of the house.
Torres' departure confirmed, Kagawa returns from ManU to Dortmund
Spanish attacker Fernando Torres' departure from Chelsea was confirmed, but the replacement entered with almost the same opening.
Chelsea announced that she had signed a four-year contract with the French tip of the Loic Remy Neighborhood Society QPR.
According to press reports, the purchase price is 13 million euros.
Torres, 30, moves to AC Milan with a two-year loan contract.
He moved to Chelsea from Liverpool with a record £50 million sum four years ago, but never met expectations.
The Japanese player Shinji Kagawa's failed trip to Manchester United also came to his decision.
Kagawa is expected to return to Borussia Dortmund, Germany, where he made his breakthrough before he moved to ManU.
According to newspaper information, the purchase price is about 8 million euros.
Kagawa's new contract is four years old.
I wanted to make my dream come true in the Champion League.
Now I'm happy to be Dortmund's man again.
This is a great team and a wonderful environment," Kagawa said.
Another Bundes League club in Berlin Hertha will be strengthened in Salomon Kalou.
Côte d'Ivoire's national team attacker is moving to Hertha from French Lille, with a transfer estimated at about €3 million.
Before Lille, Kalou, 29, played in 2006-12 in Chelsea.

The explosion happened early on Sunday and was so powerful that it shook buildings within a hundred metres.
Our whole house moved: we trembled with fear.
The explosion was so strong that our ears were ringing," Maryline Yyvon, who lives next door to the crash, described.
Already on Sunday, emergency accommodation for the house's residents was set up in a nearby school.

Bulgarian prison staff will hold a national protest
Hundreds of prison workers across Bulgaria protested before the Ministry of Justice in Sofia, the capital.
In a peaceful demonstration, they declared that they wanted back the old working regulations, which were recently amended.
The salary increases are also to be discussed with the temporary Minister of Justice, Hristo Ivanov.
For a month, prison officials have been protesting symbolically against new working hours, saying they want to return to the old 24-hour shift system.
Despite the meeting of representatives of the prison workers' organisation and the Ministry of Justice, there was no agreement, says Bulgarian national radio (BNR).
Negotiations are ongoing, Mr. Rosen Zhelyazkov, Director of the Enforcement Directorate-General, told BNR.
The protest of the prison workers' organisation is also expected to involve members of the Ministry of the Interior's trade union.
Basketball: Fan encouragement almost too much: Sasu Salin nearly fainted on the field
Basketball Sasu Salin was the embodiment of Finland's victory today.
He was able to forget his pitch-black U.S. match and beat Ukraine's second-half-time blood with stopping solutions.
But Salin passed all the credit on to the wolf fans and did it in style:
I nearly fainted at the end of the field, that encouragement was so great.
In the eyes, it was blurry, couldn't help it.
The noise and the white audience sea were almost too much for me.
Salin's power moments contained nine shallows in a fast pace, spherical ripples, record records, and tangled everywhere that happened.
I don't know how it happened, but I got into a flow state like it all worked out.
They just come from somewhere sometimes, now to an incredibly important place, Sasu was gloating.
That's my role.
To do all that.
Now it was great to see that others caught up with the plot.
It grabbed the whole gang.
Salin is the team's joy pill and spirit creator, so it's no wonder his example raised the whole team to a flight that was too much for the big, rough Ukraine's five.
Finland in the World Championships after 32 years of break: The previous ones remembered a blasphemous judge's game
Heikki Montonen (right) who carried the bag was Finland's main coach in the Argentina World Championship in 1982.
It has been 32 years since Finland's men's volleyball team played in the World Championship finals for the last time.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where legendary Reino Kosonen was Finland's second coach and current player agent Jouni Parkkali as a general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing from the tournament like yesterday: it was a hot fight against France in the primary section.
"In the finals of the match, the judge's game was glaring," Kosonen recalled.
We had already won, and both teams had already settled in the back line.
Suddenly, the game was continued.
We lost it 2-3, and after that, the pasmas went crazy more," Parkkali said.
Finland played under the command of head coach Heikki Montonen and eventually finished 17th.
Now Finland is back among the world's menus, as Poland's World Cup tournament is on its way today on Saturday.
Many things have changed dramatically in international volleyball in 32 years.
The players' strength values are about the same as before, but there is more quality and skill now.
The average lengths of players have also grown.
The game is even faster," said Parkkali.
But what about Poland?
Finland's player material has expanded, and the burden can be shared.
I expect Finland to be able to go from the primary section to the next.
Then it can be tough," Kosonen estimates.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were in a victory match against Tunisia.
Current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the World Championship.
Let's hope we're making 17th place up.
South Korea and Tunisia should go down," said Parkkali.
Genre legend Reino Kosonen was the national team's second coach in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö aired in the Tunisia match.
Sauna and evening worship at Buenos Aires Seamen's Church were part of the national team's programme at the World Championship in 1982.

Veera Vento and Veeti Tikkanen did not make it to the finals of the Young Star song competition.
No other investments were published in the competition.

The competition moments always leave great memories, says Immonen.
Finnish tourists rescued Cita from a mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all the praise"
When Merethe Mikkelsen and his dog from Norway got in trouble in the mountains on Thursday, Antti and Tuomo Soini bravely offered to help.
On the weekend Mikkelsen looked for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank his helpers once again.
Mikkelsen said in a public Facebook update that Cita dog with him in the mountains on Thursday hurt his paw.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk in steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to lure it and pull it a bit further, but its legs didn't just carry it, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, there was no help from the police, a nearby hotel or passers-by.
As the night went dark, the situation began to look threatening.
Fortunately, there were two hikers who were ready to help: Antti Soini from Tampere and his father Tuomo.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway in Galdhøpiggen and headed to their camp site when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm about the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog," Antti Soini says in a message to Ilta-Sanom.
Soon there was also a German man who had a mattress with him.
From the mattress to Cita, they got the kind of gurneys the injured dog was attached to.
The German man came after us after we thought about what to do with the dog and carried the dog down the slope for a while, Soini says.

The dog was carried down with the help of an camping mattress.
According to Soin, the performance was not physically heavy, but it was slow to carry in difficult terrain.
After about an hour and a half, however, Cita was happily able to get down.
After what happened, Mikkelsen was still looking for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank them once again.
The Soins answered him on Sunday, but the German man is apparently still unreached.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen rejoices.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't necessarily have come back.
I would like to find these people, because I feel I didn't thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all the praise and credit, I am eternally grateful to them.
On the night before Monday, the Soins were already on their way home.
They had been happy to hear from Mikkelsen: - I hear Cita is feeling better already!

The show description of the episode in Iltapulu says:

Genetic anomaly is often misdiagnosed
For years, a British woman feared death because of a misdiagnosed diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of his youth had only a few years left to live because he had been diagnosed with another illness.
In reality, he suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), a group of hereditary diseases that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
According to Charity CMT UK, a false diagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases, because so little is known about them.
It is estimated that around 23,000 people in the UK are suffering from CMT disease, which causes symptoms in motor skills such as muscle weakness, difficult walking and toes curling.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and it is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, he thought he had Friedreich's ataxia (FA), which has a very poor survival rate.
Rodgers thought he was going to be in a wheelchair before he turned 18 and died before reaching the age of 30.
Now a 51-year-old mother of two says, "As a child I knew I couldn't do the same things as others.
I fell every day, and it took me longer to do everything than everyone else.
I was never able to skate or skateboard with other children, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he had several Achilles tendon cuts to straighten his legs, and when the doctor left the room, he quickly glanced at his research papers that said he was suffering from FA disease.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, I checked the medical records in the library and wrote to the FA association," he said.
When I got information from them, I was shocked and panic-like.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair by 18 years of age and die before I turned 25, and in between I would slowly lose my full capacity.
I went through this on my own and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by the time he was 17, he found that his walk had not deteriorated as much as he thought it would and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said, "Girl, I don't think you have this disease, because otherwise you would already be in a wheelchair."
I think you're suffering from something far less dangerous.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
"When I was told what CMT was, I thought I was lucky," he said.
Charity CMT UK organises a CMT month to pay attention to the disease.
A hundred migrants were found in a coal car in Macedonia
Macedonian authorities have found more than a hundred illegal immigrants on a train carrying coal, the Ministry of the Interior said on Monday.
The stowaways were mostly Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
Migrants were found late Sunday in Veles, Central Macedonia.
It was hard to communicate with most of them.
They didn't know where they were, where they were coming from and where they were going," said Ivo Koteski, a spokesman at the Ministry of the Interior.
According to police, migrants had paid about 3,000 euros each to get to Greece, and another 800-900 euros to get to Serbia.
Illegal immigrants travel extensively through Macedonia, a couple of million people, on their way to Western Europe.
Already three million people have fled the bloody civil war in Syria.
Guardian: Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai support Scotland's independence
Pop groups Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai have joined Scottish independence supporters.
According to Guardian, the bands will star at a concert in Edinburgh in a couple of weeks to support the independence project.
There will be a referendum on Scotland's independence on 18 September.
In his statement, Mogwai said that the vote is an opportunity for the Scots that only happens once in a lifetime.
Previously, for example, actor Sean Connery has given his support to independence.
Instead, for example, British stars Paul McCartney and David Bowie have appealed to Scottish people to remain part of Britain.
In Gallupes, the supporters of independence have been defeated.
Difficulties in department stores continued in midsummer - domestic news - Ilta-Sanomat
The decline in department store trade continued also in July, says Päiväistavauppauppauppa ry.
According to it, the turnover of department store and hypermarket chains was 3.2 per cent lower in July than one year ago.
The worst has been the sales of home and leisure products, whose turnover fell by more than seven per cent from one year ago.
Dressing products also sold clearly less well than in the previous summer.
By contrast, the value of retail sales of daily goods grew by nearly three per cent year-on-year in July.
The sales grew most in small shops and large supermarkets.
The turnover of department stores and hypermarkets has contracted by more than two per cent throughout the early part of the year, that is, January-July.
The sales of daily goods, on the other hand, have grown by nearly one per cent.
Joan Rivers family "hopes for the best"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since she was admitted to a hospital in central New York, but her daughter was hopeful today that a 81-year-old comedian would recover from his illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers wrote today.
We hope for the best.
His mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday because of a cardiac arrest, saying the hospital was called an emergency by the Yorkville Endoscope clinic on the Upper East Side.

The incident has caused a broad response in the audience, and Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa, for example, have offered support online.
Areva-Siemens: Olkiluoto's third reactor will be completed in mid-2016
Areva has delivered an updated schedule of Olkiluoto 3 to Teollisuuden Voima TVO.
According to Areva, the project's recent delays have mainly been due to the application for approval of the reactor automation systems.
The project is already years late.
In May, TVO did not give any estimate of the time of completion of reactor three.
Nastola donated 1.4 hectares of beach property to Bottas - worth about 60,000 euros
The Nastola municipal board donated a 1.4-hectare beach property to Valtteri Bottas, a format driver, on the shore of Kärkjärvi, from Villähde.
The municipal government showed a fair sense of sport and was unanimous in its decision.
There was no gravel noise at the meeting when the property was decided on, says Mayor Pauli Syirakki.
Bottas' gift plot has farm buildings - seven in all.
The municipality will disassemble them even this year, except for one.
Bottas has promised to build a leisure home on the property within two years.
We are impressed that he has enjoyed his birthplace and wants to remain here.
Valtteri has visited primary schools every year to tell about her sports career and her life.
And hopefully it will continue to be, says the mayor.
The mayor estimates the bank property's monetary value to be 40,000-60,000 euros.
The beach is shallow and child-friendly.
The area has been owned by the municipality for over ten years.
Over the decades, Nastola has, with varying success, kept those who have been successful in sports using gift plots in the municipality.
The world champion Aki Parviainen and the world champion of Aerobick, Tuuli Matinsalo, got the home plots from the municipality and built the funky detached houses.
But they didn't stay in Nastola, they sold their properties and moved out.
Parviainen and Matinsalo came to Nastola for work and then changed their life situation elsewhere.
Bottas is a native of Nastola, and his situation is different, Syaraki thinks he will stay in his municipality of residence.
Hull hired the attacker with a record sum of Hernandez's club
The Champion League club Hull invested the club's record sum in the purchase of the Uruguayan national teamman Abel Hernandez.
Hernandez will switch from the Italian club Palermo to Hull for £9.5 million, or about €12 million.
The contract is three years.
Hernandez scored 14 goals last season when Palermo won Serie B and went to Italy's main series.
In the Uruguay national team, he has scored seven goals in 14 matches.
In last summer's World Cup final, Hernandez entered the field from two matches.
Abel is a fantastic acquisition and shows how far we have come in a short time, said Hull's head coach Steve Bruce.
On Monday, Hull also said he had acquired Senegal's national team captain Mohamed Diamen from West Ham.
Russian space experiment failed - the geckos sent on a sex trip died
The five little geckos sent by Russia to reproduce into space have died, says Roscosmos, the Russian Federation's space agency.
The Gekos travelled on board the Foton-M4 satellite for over a month and a half.
The satellite returned to the country on Monday morning Finnish time.
The purpose of the experiment was to study geckos' reproductive capacity and behaviour in a weightless state.
One male gecko and four females participated in the experiment.
Even though the experiment sounds bizarre, its purpose was serious.
There is little information about the effects of weightlessness on the development of geckos' eggs, for example.
The effects on the geckos can be used to predict the effects that weightlessness would have on a person while he is staying in a space similar to longer periods of time, illustrated by New Statesman in July.
According to Roscosmos, the time of death and cause or causes of death of geckos will be determined.
According to the news agency Interfax, passengers who were described as "sex geckos" froze.
The surprise is also the fact that the fruit flies that traveled with the same Foton-M4 were able to survive the trip without difficulty, and they also had offspring.
France arrested a terrorist suspect at Nice airport
France arrested a man suspected of terrorism at the airport of Nice on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected to have been a recruiter of a jihadist group in Syria.
The French authorities informed the matter on Sunday.
The authorities were able to track him after he had used money to lure a 16-year-old girl to go to Syria.
The girl was to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border from there.
The airline did not believe the girl's explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but alerted the authorities.
The authorities contacted the girl's father, who was completely unaware of her daughter's intentions and told the authorities that the family had no relatives in Turkey.
According to the authorities, the man is from Chechnya, but he now lives in France.
The French intelligence authorities had followed the man's actions earlier.
In France, the authorities have been concerned that the radicalising young people who lured Iraq or Syria into wars also pose a security risk to France.
The authorities estimate that some 800 French citizens or those registered in France have travelled to Syria, returned from there, or are currently planning to go to Syria during the last conflict.
Koponen: We have a good chance of winning
The basketball team's hopes for an extension are at stake when Finland meets Ukraine in its second World Championship match today.
If the opening loss to the United States was expected, Ukraine is again one of the countries from which Finland should take the winnings needed for the post.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I think we have a good chance of winning, Petteri Koponen predicts.
On Saturday, Ukraine struck the Dominican Republic 72-62 in its first match.
The team is coached by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, under whose command Ukraine plays aggressive basketball.
Ukraine's key player is game leader Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a hundred metres champion of the world three years ago.
Jeter scored 16 points against the Dominican Republic.
Pooh Jeter fast guy, but we've played them before, and we have to get our standard defense in order, Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland would play better than last night's defeat for the United States.
We need to find our own strengths again.
I can guarantee that there will be a normal pack of wolves in the field, Möttölä said.
The alleged naked images of Hollywood stars are spreading online - some confirmed as authentic
There are a number of nude images on the Internet that are allegedly portraying well-known public figures.
Among other things, actor Jennifer Lawrence has been the victim of a "naked image" campaign.
The entertainment website TMZ has released an angry comment from Lawrence's representatives that seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a blatant violation of privacy.
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes Jennifer Lawrence's stolen photos (on the Internet) will be prosecuted, the representatives will threaten.
According to TMZ, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the images that spread about her are authentic.
He had taken those pictures years ago with his husband.
When I know those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what a creepy trouble was for this.
I sympathise with everyone who was the victim of hacking, he writes according to the site.
Instead, actress Victoria Justice calls photos under her own name faked.
At least there are genuine or fake nude photos of Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovsky and Teresa Palmer.
Honka goalie criticizes his own: "They don't work hard enough to get out of here"
Football club FC Honka is currently in the final position of the Veikkauslijoen.
The comments from goaltender Walter Viitala after the Sunday VPS match describe the club's confused current situation.
I haven't had a goalie coach in four months.
But you have to adapt to everything," Viitala said after the battle that ended in 1-2 defeat.
Honka made a lot of defensive head mistakes especially during the first half of the match.
The goaltender Viitala wasn't pleased with bad defensive play.
The player traffic in Honga has been busy this summer, and that's why the defenders in front of Viitala have also changed frequently.
With the gamer roulette, many young players have also gained opportunities that they might not even deserve.
"Some people don't work hard enough to get out of here once in a while," Viitala snorted without naming a single player.
Honga's head coach Shefki Kuqi agreed to some extent with Viitala.
"After the game I told certain players that if you come to practice and games to have fun and think you're a betting league player and don't have to work, you're probably on the wrong team," Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of young people time.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of it, it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also reminded us that it is not possible to expect immediate success from players as the players change constantly.
This season has not had the same composition twice in a row.
Especially in the head of defense, there's been a change of people.
That is the main reason why we are in this position," Kuqi said.
After the VPS loss, Honka is a serial jumbo, with TPS, the second last one in the squares.
There are still seven laps left in the betting league, so the Espoos still have time to avoid falling to One.
I've never dropped a team, and I'm not going to do it now.
We are definitely not going to fall from this series," goalie Viitala said.
Lars von Trier doing a TV series after decades of break
Film director Lars von Trier plans to return to the production of TV shows.
Danish director is preparing a TV show called The House That Jack Build.
Louise Vesth, who was the producer of Trier's films, told about the show today at the Venice Film Festival.
According to the production company Zentropa's release, the series' descriptions should begin in 2016.
Trier is reported to be working on the script from this autumn.
The series is in English.
The mysterious project is also reported in the press release by Trier's long-time partner, Peter Aalbæk Jensen, a producer of his hard selling speeches.
According to him, a similar series "has never been seen or will never be seen."
"Hold your breath," Aalbæk Jensen said in a press release.
Lars von Trier, 58, has been known in recent years for his tumultuous media appearances and films such as Antichrist and Nymphomaniac.
In the 1990s, he directed the Kingdom Series to television.

From a participant in Ice Bucket challenge, dislocated jaw
British Isabelle Roberts roared so hard when ice cold water was poured over her head that she damaged the bones of her face.
This Ice Bucket challenge ended painfully badly.
The woman has been taken to care for her roughness while performing the Ice Bucket challenge so hard that her jawbone was dislocated.

Ice water is poured over a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts just before the accident
I tried to shut my mouth, but I couldn't, my jaw was locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister noticed the same thing and began to laugh, but I had to be rushed to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old British who took part in the Super Popular Challenge on Tuesday was taken to the hospital, where the jaw was put back in place.
Video has become an Internet sensation and has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
A perspective on howling wolves (even): How can you explain the growth of fans?
I was feeling really great today.
That's what basketball player Sakari Pehkonen said in 1995, after Finland had played against France in the European Championship final in the ball hall of Marouss, Athens.
Pehkonen wasn't exaggerating.
I remember the game when I was there.
So were the about 100 Finns who shouted noises at an empty hall that attracted 20,000 viewers.
What would Pehkonen have said 19 years later after the Finnish-Ukraina World Championship match?
In Bilbao, there are eighty times the number of Finnish fans.
The European Championships in 1995 was a search time for Finnish basketball.
The men made their way to the finals by winning, for example, the Russian qualifier at the Helsinki Sports House.
That victory opened the doors to Europe's cream.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people like Hanno Möttölä.
Chief coach Henrik Dettmann raised Möttölä to the final tournament team with lime lines.
A solution many disagreed with.
It can now be said that Dettmann was wise from a distance, even though everything did not go according to the script.
After Athens, the national basketball team dived deep.
There were probably just over a hundred Finns present at the Athens Games.
It included journalists, players' relatives, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
There are journalists, relatives and coaches in Bilbao, but there are also fans.
And there are a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to unfathomable proportions.
I don't think anyone can say an exact chapter about Finnish racing tourists.
Estimates have moved between 7 500 and 10,000.
Whatever the number between now and then, it's an incomprehensible amount.
This is an explanation for sports sociologists.
In the global world economy, companies move across borders.
There is still an opportunity to see how we are doing internationally in sport.
As mobility increases, we can see how our girls and boys are doing in the world, says Hannu Itkonen, professor of sports sociology.
Surely there are Finns in both Spain and the volleyball World Championships in Poland who are looking for an experience.
Shared experience.
But that doesn't explain everything.
There must be attraction in sport itself.
Itkonen places sport as a part of popular culture.
It is a lower threshold to go to sports games than to Berlin to watch art.
But without success, you can't move the masses.
Let's go back to 1995.
Then head coach Dettmann challenged the basketball league and players to throw themselves into top sports professionally.
It took almost ten years.
Then the direction changed and the national team action was raised to a pedestal.
The volleyball people made the same move a little earlier.
Now both enjoy the fruits of the work.
As Itkonen says, both sports have managed to produce their top sports, where the sacred trinity works: sports-media sponsors.
The audience will also be interested.
And the media has taught what this kind of carnival support is, Itkonen reminds.
Are the ball sports able to pass this massive interest on to the home series as well?
On average, hundreds or slightly over 1,000 viewers are played in basketball and volleyball.
Itkonen thinks the question is good and does not necessarily give an answer that would promise very good for the species.
The other school thinks the interest will be transferred.
The other one is the one who doesn't want sweet to the full of the stomach.
This group is ready for an adventure trip to the World Championships, but in their basic thinking, domestic series are not of double interest.
It's a challenge for companion people in the middle of a rush.
Bottas property confirmation - nearly 1.5 hectares from the lake shore
Nastola rewards the formula driver Valtteri Bottas with a beach property.
The municipal government unanimously approved the transfer of 1.4 hectares at its meeting on Monday.
There will be a free-time residence on the property in the future.
In Nastola, Bottas' success has been monitored since his karting days.
He is seen as a good ambassador to market Lahte, Lahti region and Nastola.
The gift plot is located in Koiska, on the shore of Kärkjärvi.
It has come under the ownership of the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate transaction.
There are seven demolition buildings in the area, from which the municipality will disassemble six at the expense by the end of this year.
Bottas won the formula 1 in Belgium's competition for his fourth prize baller this year.
He's fifth in the World Championship.
Bottas is a native of Nastola and lived in Villähde for his childhood.
He now lives in England, but he visits Nastola whenever there are free formulas.
Bottas has visited secondary schools and youth facilities.
Design smart clothes come - but hardly for the poor
It will present and test them in the U.S. Open tennis competition currently underway in New York.
Ralph Lauren's smart shirts are tested by ball people in the field, but also by the top amateur of college players, Marcus Giron, wears one.
According to him, the shirt helps him follow his own development and regulate his recovery.
Silver sensors have been woven into the nylon shirt, from which the information is transmitted to the mop in the shirt and from there to the smartphone or tablet computer.
Sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythm, stress and steps.
Before the shirt is thrown into the washing machine, the mokkula, which is a central unit, will be removed.
The fashion house has not given an exact time to start selling the shirt, nor did it even hint about its price, Tech Times reports.
Raph Lauren is not the only company that invests in smart clothes.
Athos, from California, has put on sale a smart shirt and smart shorts.
They measure heart rate, breathing and muscle work.
The clothes cost $100 apiece, and the central unit the size of their thumbs costs $200.
Red Orbit also wrote about the technological clothes.
Smart way to save in textbooks
The cost of university books in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so Matt Schroeder, who is about to start his second year of study, found a smart way to save on costs.
He developed a system where students from later classes borrowed their books for nominal compensation instead of selling the books right away.
"My math book would normally have cost $180; I paid $10 for its use for the whole semester and a fat sandwich," says 19-year-old Schroeder, who is studying at Covenant College in the state of Georgia.
Schroeder says his books last semester would normally have cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the university board, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but the students have many ways of reducing these costs.
Students increasingly end up using online shops and creative approaches such as Schroeder's idea.
More and more students rent textbooks, so they can use the book throughout the semester and pay far less for it than the students who buy the book.
According to Neebo Inc, a company with over 250 campus book stores, the renting of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Statistics on the sector reveal that about a quarter of the university bookshop books in the past spring were rental books, says Trevor Meyer, president of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus bookstores.
Here are the simplest ways to save clear money.
Online stores
In online shops, a new book can only be obtained for a third of the price it would cost at the campus bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler's "Calculus" book is nearly $290, but Chegg.com's book is $23.99.
Buy Used
The books used are a good option if the reader is not disturbed by other people's notes and worn appearance.
For example, the book "Calculus" can be used from Chegg.com online store for $93.49.
Brigham Young University senior student Matt Casaday, 25 years old, says he bought the book "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" from Amazon.com for just $0.42.
The new book would have cost $48.
Ingrid Bracey, head of Amherst's College Without Walls, University of Massachusetts, and other academics recommend that students ask their professors whether previous editions can be used in the course.
Sometimes the reform of the new edition is not relevant to teaching.
In this case, the old edition can only be found for a fraction of the price that should be paid for the new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Renting
It is worth considering renting textbooks if you take good care of them, remember to return them and don't need them after completing the course.
By renting, you can save over 80 per cent of the price of the new book.
For example, renting the "Calculus" book for the whole semester costs about $20.
Check out the rules of the renting company, such as notes, the use and wear of the highlight pen.
Renter, be careful: if you forget to return the book, the delay fee may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-books
Getting e-books instead of ordinary paper can also be a question.
Sometimes these books are rented, paying for access to e-books to its holder, such as Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
The Chegg store offers the book "Calculus" as an e-book for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, many students in literature save the most, since many classics can now be downloaded for free, while books in science and technology can be very expensive.
It pays to compare the different sellers, which option they choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who is about to begin at Pepperdine Law School, recommends using the book ISBN number to determine the price, since it can be used to make sure you're looking for the right book.
Before ordering online, make sure the book is in stock, Gault says.
He himself learned this the hard way.
The book he bought was frozen for four weeks, and he finally had to get the book at full cost at the university bookstore.
The Tampere Legion Theatre turns 20

Nearly twice the number of people killed in fires compared to last year
Nearly twice as many people have died in fires this year compared to last year.
According to media monitoring by the Finnish Rescue Agency (Spek), 55 people have already died in 49 different fires in the pieces so far.
Last year, there were 31 fire deaths in the corresponding period.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
There have been 11 people over 65.
According to the organisation's fire death statistics, the last worse situation was in 2009, when 64 people had died in the fires by the end of August.
Most of the fire deaths happen in apartments.
There have been 17 fire deaths in blocks of flats, 21 in detached houses and seven in terraced and other small houses.
Spek reminds me of the fire safety review in the home.
At least all home fire alarms should be verified according to Spek.
In addition, everyone should check that the start-up fire extinguishers are easy to use.
There must also be an unobstructed exit route from all areas of the home.
Children should also be told what electrical equipment they can use when they are alone at home.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
The opponents of the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the city centre of Newport in an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for a so-called countersummary.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events over the weekend and spoke with protesters who had even arrived from Belgium.
The young were rescued by air from Australia's Blue Mountains
TWO teenage hikers were raised to safety after a night stuck in the Blue Mountains in Australia's New South Wales area.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went hiking after noon on Sunday to Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
The relatives were concerned about the young people who had not returned home and called the police at 8 pm.
A search party made up of local police officers and helpers was sent to search for young people, and the duo was found near Bridal Veil Falls at about 23 pm.
The girl had injured her knee, and the man had fallen and hit his head.
The police spent the night with a couple, and they were raised to safety on Monday morning.
The hikers were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdrew from Luhansk airport
Ukrainian troops have retreated from Luhansk airport.
According to the Ukrainian army, the soldiers were ordered to retreat.
According to Ukraine, the paratroopers have been fiercely engaged with Russian tanks on the field.
According to a military spokesman, the opposing gunfire has been so precise that Russian professional soldiers are likely to be the shooter.
During the past 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
Ukraine's patrol ship, which received artillery hits yesterday in the Asovan Sea off southeastern Ukraine, sank in the morning, says the border guard.
Eight Marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The border guard wasn't sure where the ship was fired from.
Separatists said they shot the ship yesterday in the social media.
According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russia will not attack Ukraine.
However, Lavrov insisted that Ukrainian forces should immediately withdraw to positions from which they cannot fire on civilians.
According to the Foreign Minister, there should be an immediate cease-fire without conditions in Minsk's talks today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE.
Mr Lavrov also pointed out that Russia would respond to possible new economic sanctions.
First, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions from our partners' actions, Lavrov threatened.
Heavy rain caused Malmö and Copenhagen to flood
The streets were flooded on Sunday in Malmö and Copenhagen when heavy rains were whipping southern Sweden and Denmark.
The floodwaters cut off several roads, mixed traffic and buried cars in their undersides.
The authorities estimated on Sunday that it might take a while to ease the flood, even though the rains were predicted to stop by Monday.
The heavy rains surprised the Swedish authorities, and no weather warning was given in advance about the rains.
Meteorologist Ari Mustala, who is on call at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, estimated that the rain front that affected the area was very local.
The rainy area looks narrow and permanent.
No wonder it's been hard to predict.
French Socialists should "be quiet and help France," Francois Hollande's main supporter said
Valls urged a deeply divided left to "show his feelings" for a socialist president with difficulties, whose new government's composition did not win the approval of the majority of French people.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"It's our job to stay by his side," Valls said and earned a round of applause.
As a calming gesture, the Prime Minister called on the government to leave France's controversial 35-hour working week in peace, despite the suggestion made earlier this week by the new finance minister Emmanuel Macron, that the rule should be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to work together with the government.
However, the Minister of Justice, Christiane Taubira, caused disunity by appearing at a meeting of the socialist MPs who expressed differing opinions and criticising the Socialist Party for allowing 'France to give up hope for the future'.
Marine Le Pen, leader of the extreme right-wing national front, mocked the socialists' constant discord and said he did not think the new government in Valls would last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande may have gone to the war, but so has Manuel Valls, who had a duty to form a new government after the previous one did not last even for the summer.
"And the new government won't last until autumn or winter," Le Pen said to journalists.
He repeated his party's proposal to disband the parliament and held the party's election victory in early elections for sure, and he himself would be ready to lead the party.
France's ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in March's municipal elections, and the far right held the list tip in May's EU elections.
According to a poll in Sunday's Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party could break up into several rival groups before Hollande's season ends in 2017.
Po University political researcher Pascal Perrineau warned that the French would soon lose patience unless the new socialist government succeeds in improving the economy and record high unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the public must quickly realise that the change is about to happen," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get even worse.
Pokka betrayed Good morning Finnish hosts Kirsi Alm-Moira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouda's pokka failed badly in the recorded part of the programme.
Good morning Finland published a fun video of the recordings made on Thursday on its Facebook page last Thursday.
In the video, hosted by Kirsi Alm-Sira and Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouta try to record the Finnish ad puff on the next day's broadcast, but the recording is not going to go quite well.
Alm-Sira is confused when he tries to pronounce the word budget riff, and his confusion also causes Pouda and Rahkola to lose their nerve time and again.
And these heroes should be allowed to broadcast live tomorrow, says Finland's Facebook update.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been both liked and shared over 10,000 times on Facebook.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked in the photo office, was third in the potret series in 1972.
The picture shows Israel's prime minister Golda Meir.
In Fredrikinkatu, Helsinki, a meeting of the Socialist International was held in the House of Building Masters in May 1971.
There were a lot of heads of state at the meeting and the security measures were huge.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went along.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we had more than five minutes to film.
I took this picture from four to five metres away.
The light and background were right.
I immediately realized that this time I succeeded.
From the look of Meir, you can see that the leaders of the Middle East have had a hard time before.
At that time, the competition was successful with pictures of known people or events.
It is great that you can also succeed with other images today, as long as you have an idea and visual twist.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best is Lasse Virén's crash photo of the Munich Olympics.
I didn't send it to the competition.
Dissertation: The Aarnio investigation already cost more than five million euros
The investigation of the legality of the operations of the drugs unit of the Helsinki police has already cost more than five million euros and required 30-50 person-years.
That's how Jyri Rajamäki assessed in his IT dissertation to the University of Jyväskylä.
Rajamäki suggests that the control of the legality of police operations and the fight against crime in general could be significantly improved by combining the IT systems of investigation and legal proceedings.
According to Rajamäki, modern technology allows multiple use of forensic material.
He says it is possible to build a system in which the data collected to solve a crime is automatically electronic evidence that fills a chain of evidence and at the same time allows for comprehensive law enforcement.
The dissertation will be examined on Saturday.
Yle: The 1999 concept of vegetarian food was forgotten on the school wall: "Fish and chicken dishes belonging to the vegetable diet"
A photo of a special announcement on the wall of the Pirkkala Women's Travel School caused food noise in social media, says Yle on her website.
Vegetarians!
Fish and chicken dishes belonging to the vegetarian diet at school lunch.
Only when there is meat on the list will we make a vegetarian alternative!
That is what is said in a 15-year-old press release that has been forgotten on the school wall.
You can see the picture from here.
The image that has spread in social media has caused people to send indignant feedback to Pirkkala municipality.
Arja Vaarma, head of food and cleanliness services, says to Yle that the note that was left on the wall is not true and should have been removed a long time ago.
Apparently, before I came here, there has been a thought like this that has been discussed with health care in the past.
Every student gets the meal they want, he says to Yle.
Today, in Pirkkala schools, students are offered a vegetarian option only with the permission of their parents and a certificate from a doctor or nurse about a vegetarian diet.
The stake justifies the solution to Yle by the fact that young people's vegetarian experiments may leave nutrition under control, and the lack of meat or chicken can be surprising to students' parents.
Norwegian Cruise near a $3 billion Prestige Cruise deal
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NHL.O, the world's third-largest cruise company, is negotiating to buy its rival Prestige Cruises International Inc for $3 billion, from people closely involved.
With the deal, Norwegian Cruise, with a market value of $6.8 billion, would have access to Prestige Cruises luxury cruisers and wealthy customers as it continued to compete against bigger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
According to sources, information about a possible contract may be published already this week, though it is also possible that the negotiations will not deliver.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources didn't want their names in the public eye, because there are no negotiations in the public eye.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to comments and Apollo's representative refused to comment.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, has 13 cruise ships with a route map covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its turnover grew 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013, when it amounted to $2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, who also operates from Miami, sails under Oceania and Regent brands, with a total of eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was $1.2 billion, which is six per cent more than in the year before.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the rise in the middle classes of emerging economies, such as China and India, in the coming years.
Companies compete to be the top choice for these new customers when they choose a cruise.
Prestige Cruises registered its first share issue on the US stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company's shares since the 2007 deal, worth $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in its current line-up in 2000 after it merged with Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), the latter being the entertainment and casino company of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the information released, Genting's share of the company was 28 per cent, Apollo's 20 per cent, and private equity company TPG Capital LP's 8 per cent from the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise account for 82 per cent of the cruise capacity in North America, as shown in the registration document published by Prestige Cruise on the issue of shares.
The City Board of Tampere will discuss the matter today.
Animalia hopes the city government will support the initiative strongly.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, Executive Director of Animalia, who is preparing a doctoral thesis for the University of Tampere, there is a need to close the dolphinariums in Finland and around the world as a matter of urgency.
Fortunately, in recent years, there has been a widespread view around the world that the holding of advanced mammals such as dolphins in dolphinariums is neither protective nor ethical.
This view should also be borne by Tampere.
The abolition of the Delfinarium is not only a question of animal rights, but also a question of Tampere's image as a tourist destination, Tuomivaara points out.
According to Tuomivaara, Nasi-delphine's death reinforces the requirements for the downgrading of dolphinarium operations.
The death of Näs is a sad continuation of the dark history of the Dolphinarium in Särkäniemi.
It is time to put a stop to the deaths, to close the dolphin prison, and to begin to figure out how to move Tampere dolphins to a limited sea area, a kind of dolphin shelter, Tuomivaara insists.
Your vision did not have time to return to the original dolphin habitat, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Särkänenniemi will have time to experience more life than just an unstimulated concrete pool, Tuomivaara hopes.
The Animal Welfare Association of Animalia's goal is to ban the use of all wild species in circuses in the overall reform of the animal welfare law in preparation.
This includes dolphinariums.
To support this demand, Animalia's Executive Director Tuomivaara will take part in today's demonstration on behalf of dolphins on 1 September.
The demonstration at the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki takes a stand against the dolphin hunting season beginning in Japan.
During the hunting season, about 2,300 dolphins are brutally imprisoned or killed each year, either for dolphins or for food.
Putin demands Kiev to open talks with Eastern Ukraine on the new state
Russia's President Vladimir Putin insisted on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "state-like" of the secession region, Russia's news sources say.
His representative Dmitry Peskov later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian region would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine would have to be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking people the power to defend their own rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiev government to negotiate with Russian-minded rebels as equal negotiating partners is in line with his obvious strategy since the violence began five years ago: he is trying to help separatists take over the area and thus force the Ukrainian government to effectively grant the recently declared Novorossija independence, which allows it to head for Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the State Channel 1 channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian army's attempts to recapture the Eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region, controlled by separatists, which was taken over by separatists in March and April after Moscow's annexation of the Ukrainian Crimean peninsula on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently dubbed the area "Novorossija", "New Russia", a term similar to the days of splendor that preceded the revolutions of the Russian empire.
According to Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said the planned peace talks were "an illusion" as long as Ukrainian politicians campaign for the parliamentary elections on 26 October and government forces attack civilians in separatist-controlled areas.
"We must immediately begin extensive negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the organisation of society and the status of the state of Southeast Ukraine, taking into account the interests of the people living there," he said.
According to Peskov, Putin's reference to "statehood" is related to a broader independence, which has been discussed for months with Kiev's leadership in its attempt to dispel the fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights are under threat.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need, says Peskov.
There can be no discussion on this issue between Ukraine and Russia, says Peskov, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict within Ukraine."
The Kremlin spokesman's interim remark, which was intended to correct the "false interpretation" of Putin's comments, stressed that the Russian regime deals with the separatist rebellion in the eastern regions in a different way than in the Crimea, which practically took over an area of which the majority of the population of 2 million people are ethnicly Russian.
Moscow would be much more difficult to link even the Donetsk or Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, because most of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russian and, according to pre-conflict polls, the majority of the population supported staying in Ukraine.
The independence that Russian diplomats have discussed in international fora would give Ukrainian local authorities the right to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give the Kremlin practically power over the area that links Russia to Crimea.
On the Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed to Russia five months ago, Russia's main fleet, as well as commercial seaport areas and historical coastal sites are located.
There are also mines, factories and metal smelters in the Russian region between Rostov and Crimea, which produce vital products for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed in his inaugural speech on 7 June that Ukrainian legislators - after the new elections - consider constitutional changes in order to increase the decision-making power of regions that are not part of Ukraine's core area on their own economy and the status of languages.
However, his vision of independence seems to differ sharply from that of separatists, perhaps armed and fuelled by the Kremlin and Moscow.
Putin made his latest request to the Kiev government to negotiate with Russian-minded rebels as equal partners after the rebels made further progress last week after Russian tanks and troops invaded Eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area on the Azov coast.
Ukrainian security authorities fear that the taking over of the city of Novoazovski by separatists supported by Russia will be the beginning of a larger effort to take over the entire strategically important coastal area up to Crimea.
It has led to massive civilian and military reinforcement of Mariupol city, known as a steel-producing port city between Novoazovsky and the narrow land area leading to the Crimean peninsula.
On Saturday, Mr Pooshenko spoke to the leaders of the European Union in Brussels asking for further measures to prevent Russia's future violations in Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We are about to reach a point from which there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take any direct action decisions; the leaders proposed further sanctions to be imposed if the Ukrainian crisis flares again in unclear circumstances.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in the Ilovaisk region after two Russian armored units and 1,000 soldiers moved to Donetsk last week to strengthen the separatists in trouble, General Andriy Lysenko, a representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
According to Lysenko, the first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers surrounded by Russia in Ilovaisk were replaced by 10 Russian skydivers who were imprisoned in Ukrainian territory a week ago.
Milan's opening goal was scored by the Japanese artist Keisuke Honda already in the seventh minute of the game.
At the second half, Sulley Muntar hit first and a little later Jeremy Menez hit the penalty kick.
Lazio, too, got a heavyweight at the end of the game after his narrowing goal, but Diego Lopez, the goalkeeper, rejected Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez moved to Milan for this season from Real Madrid.
Milan's former aggressor icon in Inzagh's coaching debut San Siro stadium was only half full.
The audience of the match was reported to be 39,000 viewers.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko in a twist of a nude scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he is outraged by hackers who may have stolen his fiancée and Hollywood A-lister Gabi Grecko's nude photos.
In the entertainment world, a number of Jennifer Lawrence nude photos have been released on the internet as a result of a widespread celebrity image hacking scandal.
The hacker has been said to have a total of 60 nude pictures of Hunger Star Lawrence and other superstars like Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actor Kirsten Dunst.
Also pictures of Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovsky and Grecko in Melbourne have apparently been stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko last month, said to Confidential, "this is disgusting."
All personal contacts and images should remain private.
It is a disgrace that private information can be stolen and disseminated.
Greckon, who is in New York, is reported to have commented on the case in an online magazine "disadvantaged" and said that the victims "feel disgraced."
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with his previous boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of Palmer at the topless pool edge.
Palmer's film rewards include, for example, the film "Love and Honor" with co-star Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck star Strahovsky and Sucker Punch actor Browning did not comment on the hacked photos yesterday.
Lawrence's spokesman said to TMZ that "it is an insolent violation of privacy."
Actress Seth Rogen was angry with a hacker in a tweet: "The release of stolen photos from a mobile phone is no different from the sale of a stolen product."
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, from a legal point of view alone.
Finland played almost as if in its home field and rose to a sensational victory from Cuba in the volleyball World Championships.
Check out the photos of the fan drug.
Poland's Katowice was white on Monday: not Polish red and white, but Finnish blue and white.
According to STT, Finland's victory was followed by nearly 2,000 Finnish supporters in the Spodek arena.
It felt like playing in the home field.
That's how much the fans had to do with our game, Finnish captain Antti Siltala said to STT.
Finland was already losing 0-2 in the match, but won 3-2.
In the fourth round, Finland made a miracle rise from six points.
Cuba already led the round 16-10, but after that the Finns got the buzz on.
However, a couple of hundred Finnish fans were disappointed when the charter plane was unable to land in Katowice because of the heavy fog.
So the fans who ended up in Warsaw were late for the match.
Finnish ball fans have conquered Europe at a fast pace in recent days.
In Bilbao, Spain, there are over 8,000 fans of Finland in the World Championships.
As if every basket in Finland had been the winning basket of the match, U.S. star Stephen Curry praised Finnish basketball fans after Saturday's match.
