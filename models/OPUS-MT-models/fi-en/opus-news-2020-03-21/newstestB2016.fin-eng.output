9-year-old boy on the run in Tampere found
The police have had a search mission because of a 9-year-old boy's flight to Tampere on Tuesday evening.
A missing persons report about a boy who left West Tampere with a friend has spread on social media.
According to the police situation centre, the boy has been contacted and has no danger to life or health.
The boy's father told Ilta-Sanom at midnight that the boy was found.
He's fine, and now we're going to start the after hearings.
The boy was found near the home, the father said.
Ronaldo, on the other hand, ransacked the score to Messi.
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league this weekend and continued to produce in the Champions League as well.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo over the Champions League's goal king turned at least for a moment to the advantage of the latter.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo went to the top of all-time scorer statistics alone when he shot the visitor Shahtar Donetsk's net with two shootouts and one in the game situation.
Ronaldo raised his goal balance to 80 when the Barcelona Messi, who had been evenly read with him before Tuesday, had 77 hits.
Real won 4-0.
Juventus has stumbled in Italy's football league in Serie A from the early days, but in the Champions League's League's League's D-block it started with a powerful 2-1 guest victory from Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored over ten minutes before the end of Juventus' Alvaro Morata.
The city's attack was blunted by the absence of knee-weak Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in the weekend's champion league game, didn't come to the airport until the last ten minutes.
Manchester's second club United also suffered hard in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after having suffered a 1-2 loss.
ManU's 20-year-old wingman Luke Shaw had only a quarter of an hour in a foreign game.
PSV Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking slide tackle hit ManU-baked goal so badly that Shaw was likely to break his tibia.
Shaw was lying on the grass at Eindhoven's home stadium about ten minutes before medical staff left to transport him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests to a 1-0 lead at 41 minutes, but ManU's joy lasted just a few minutes.
Moreno evened out before the break with extra time.
The PSV winning goal was scored at the second half by Luciano Narsingh.
In the Champions League of the Painting Period, Paris Saint-Germain of the A-block began.
An Argentine Angel Di Maria changed Manchester United's shirt to PSG.
Di Maria broke through the right and lifted the ball to the mantelpiece past Malmo's goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani did 2-0 for PSG in the second half.
PSG has been guessed among the season's winners.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of the league's small clubs, is not the best possible benchmark.
For the first time, PSG star attacker Zlatan Ibrahimovic faced his professional career as a starting club with Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team in Moscow's TsSKA lost 0-1 to Wolfsburg in a B-block match in Germany.
The opposition party demanded immediate resignation - the president gave the wrong speech
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has given the same speech in the country's parliament at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently didn't realize the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether 91-year-old Mugabe is fully alive.
The main opposition party MDC demanded Mugabe resign because he is too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants rushed to say that the confusion had taken place only in Mugabe's headquarters and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech discussed earlier and now China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an extraordinary summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have proposed an extra summit of EU leaders next week because of the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, who is leading the summits, will assess the request.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, state leaders should discuss cooperation with countries of origin and how to better register those who come to Europe.
According to Merkel, the negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers belong to the home ministers' table.
Professor admits he shot his girlfriend in an emergency call
University professor Shannon Lamb asked for a voice in an emergency call to shake the police at home and said he shot his girlfriend.
Lamb specifically mentioned that their beloved dog was there and alive and probably scared, and the professor said that the contact details of the dead woman's family would be on her phone.
Inside the house, police found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten note on white paper: "I'm very sorry and I wish I could undo what I did. I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," Lamb wrote in a letter signed by the authorities.
There were no signs that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already travelled 500 kilometres to the school campus, and the police found Ethan Schmidt, a professor of dead history who is believed to have been shot by Lamb at the door of his office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said the university officials were informed about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
According to him, Lamb made a fatal 911 call some time after this.
There was one more death in the day, and Lamb took his own life when the police reached him.
The day after the shootings, students and teaching staff remained behind locked doors, and officials were still trying to find out Lamb's motive.
The researchers explained the details in both places, and those who knew Lamb told about the man, and the researchers gave a picture of a talented but perhaps problematic teacher.
The students always said they were looking forward to the professor's classes.
According to Gautier police in Prentiss's place of death, the professor had no previous history of violence or crime.
Schmidt, on the other hand, had mentioned Lamb in a book in which he had acknowledged "the wonderful people" with whom he was allowed to live an academic life.
Both worked at the Department of Social Sciences and History, with 17 teaching staff, and many of the students took part in both men's courses.
However, reference was made to the problems.
Brandon Beavers, a student who praised Lamb, said the professor seemed agitated and nervous, "like he was having a problem."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb had told him at the end of the academic year 2014-2015 that he was suffering from stress.
Lamb had previously applied to Delta State University for sick leave because of some kind of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's payroll policy meant that Lamb's dissertation, for which he had worked hard, would not automatically guarantee him an assistant professorship.
University principal William LaForge said he wasn't aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but said that something was clearly bothering Lamb.
Lamb can no longer answer these questions.
After leaving campus, the police found out what route Lamb had taken from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before the police reached Lamb, he had taken a life with a 38-caliber pistol in the backyard of the house in Greenville, Mississippi, about a mile from his parents' home, M. Methel Johnson said.
Lamb's car was still running in the driveway.
The police didn't immediately find out why Lamb had gone to this very house, but Johnson said he believed the man knew the people in the house.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb started working as a geography and education teacher at a university with 3,500 students, with a population of 12,000 in 2009 .
He received a doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's longest-time friends described this as smart, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she met Lamb through mutual friends when she was 15 and Lamb was 20.
She and her friends were still in high school, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who spent years trying to teach Hairston how to play guitar.
"Lamb was quite a heartbreaker back then.
All the girls were in love with him," said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the Jackson suburbs of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been seeing each other for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but no document said they were married.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, and they lived in a brick house in a small town in Gautier's river estuary.
Police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen said he divorced Prentiss 15 years ago, and the couple had remained friends, and they have a daughter who is now 19.
"She was devastated," O'Steen said about her daughter.
"The daughter and mother were best friends."
O'Steen had not met Lamb, but heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb liked music and played blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail both performed at a summer event three years ago.
Later, they also played together at times.
According to O'Steen, his daughter composes and plays her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies online.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and part-time entertainment coordinator at the modest The Julep Room restaurant outside Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss on September 5, after Lamb played guitar and harp to a few audiences.
There was no indication that something was wrong.
"A happy couple," Shaffer said.
"We joked together.
Both had a good sense of humor."
"Surprised professor Schmidt directed first-year seminars and specialized in Indian and colonial history," said Don Allan Mitchell, English professor.
She was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was the chairman of his own fraternity and student union.
At Delta State University campus, there are 900 people gathered in candlelight at a memorial service in Cleveland, including teaching staff, other staff, students and residents of the area.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a nightly event where the university choir performed the songs "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The lesson will continue on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get the students to come back," LaForge said.
"The crisis is over.
This is a healing day."
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland in Mississippi.
Assistant reporters: Associated Press reporters Emily Wagster Pettus in Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The case has been corrected, because the police now say Lamb made an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and it was specified that while Lamb referred to Prentis as his wife, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us does not intend to hire as many seasonal workers as it did last year, but the dealer of toys and baby products says he will offer his current employees and seasonal workers an opportunity for additional hours.
The company plans to hire 40,000 people to shops and distribution centres across the country, and in 2014 it hired 45,000 seasonal workers.
Most of the jobs are part-time.
Interviews of applicants will begin this month, and new employees will start in October-December.
Even though the holiday season is still months away, the trade season is approaching at a good pace, and companies are preparing to hire temporary staff for shops and for the delivery and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was an important moment for Michael J. Fox's career.
The premiere also had a personal significance.
"We sat in the theatre and waited for the royals to arrive, and I found there was an empty place next to me, and it dawned on me that Princess Diana is coming next to me," Fox said in the trailer of the upcoming Back in Time document.
"When the film began, I realized the situation was very much like a date with the Princess of Wales."
The Back in Time document relates to "Back to the Future" films, and the documentary also interviews Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg.
The film "Back to the Future" was premiered 30 years ago.
"This film is definitely an all-time time travel film for me," Spielberg said.
Back in Time will be published in VOD and DVD format and will be shown in selected cinemas from October onwards.
UN Secretary General: no military solution in Syria
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon commented on Russia's intensified military action, saying there is no military solution to the nearly five-year conflict and that guns will only bring more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The secretary-general again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to join forces and support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Ban announced plans to meet five permanent members of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France, to discuss the situation in Syria, scheduled for the UN General Assembly Ministerial Week later this month.
Ban regretted that the disintegration of the Security Council, the Syrian people and regional powers has caused a situation that is impossible to resolve.
Ban called on five permanent member states to show the same solidarity and unity in the context of the Syrian crisis that achieved Iran's nuclear agreement.
Eight chapters of the polls: Donald Trump for real?
They have tried to label Trump as an idler.
He has also been considered a joke.
Some predict a collapse for Trump.
In Republican circles (for now) every effort has been made to pull Trump out of the polls.
Ten of the 11 national polls show Donald Trump double-digit support numbers, and some are already seriously considering what it says about real estate mogul's candidacy.
However, the election is still in its early stages.
There has been no announcement yet that Trump will be nominated as a Republican candidate.
Experts point out that Rick Perry, who was at the polls at this time in 2011, was allowed to give space to the rising Herman Cain, and neither of them finally won the election in any state.
Trump would, for many reasons, be difficult in a general election.
Outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth have taken note of Trump's strong position and started digging for his fall.
The following recent polls show that the real estate mogul cannot be ignored with a shoulder wound:
There has been a turnaround in Trump's support.
Just before Trump announced that he would run in mid-June, according to the Monmouth University Gallup, only two out of ten Republicans had a positive picture of real estate moguls.
By mid-July, 40% already had a positive image.
At the beginning of August, the corresponding proportion was 52 per cent.
Now six out of ten Republicans have a positive image of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten people have a negative image.
These figures also hold in the states where the elections take place first.
In last week's Quinnipiac gallup, 60% of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of Republicans would be happy with Trump's candidacy.
In CNN and ORC poll last week, 67% of Republicans said they were very satisfied or satisfied with Trump's possible nomination.
Only two out of 10 would be very unhappy with Trump's nomination.
Ben Carson gets almost as enthusiastic a reception as Trump (43 percent would be very satisfied with Carson's nomination and 40 percent of Trump's candidacy).
Who will be the next most popular candidate?
The third is Marco Rubio, with a 21 per cent support rate.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans would be unhappy or very unhappy if Jeb Bush were elected as a party candidate.
Most Republicans don't think Trump's temper is problematic.
Donald Trump has been widely criticised for his pompousness and offensive comments, and 52 percent of Republican supporters across the country consider the properties of the real estate mogul to be suitable for the president, as evidenced by ABC News and Washington Post polls.
The same is true of Iowa, where the party meeting is the first to take place: according to the Quinnipiac Gallup, 52 percent of Republicans consider Trump's personal qualities fit for the Chief of Defense.
However, according to ABC and Posti's poll, 44 percent say Trump is unable to function effectively, and six out of ten think Trump's temper is inappropriate for the White House.
Republicans are getting used to the idea.
They're starting to take Trump seriously.
When Republicans are asked who is most likely to be elected as a party candidate, according to CNN and ORC polls, four out of 10 people believe in Trump's chances.
The situation has changed since mid-July, when four out of ten would have put their money on Jeb Bush's side.
The Republicans have never had a very reliable crystal ball at their disposal before.
At this point in the last election, four out of ten Republicans considered Rick Perry a likely candidate, and only 28 percent of Mitt Romney.
The majority seem to think Trump's campaign is convincing.
Even if Republicans support another candidate, Trump will beat almost all the other candidates.
Some experts feel that a divided camp is likely to benefit Trump, as Trump's opponents are divided into supporters of different candidates.
At the beginning of September, a poll at Monmouth University revealed that Trump would almost always win a bigger support group in an imaginary double-cross between Trump and almost any other Republican candidate.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie with 33 points each.
With Ted Cruz, he's even.
Is Cruz Trump's only real opponent?
Ben Carson would win Trump with a 19-point difference in an imaginary double-cross.
A small majority of Trump's supporters say they have already taken a vote.
According to a poll published by CBS and NYT on Tuesday, more than half of Trump's supporters are confident of their vote.
Of course, the situation can change for a number of reasons, and at the moment a certain voter can also change his mind.
46 per cent of Trump's supporters have not made a final decision.
Trump's biggest rival at the moment is neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who have already elected their candidates are twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans agree with Trump's view of immigration.
Since Donald Trump called in his campaign speech two months ago, immigrants from Mexico as rapists have been a hot topic for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's pompous speeches will banish important Latin American voters from Republican troops and hinder brand renewal.
However, according to the ABC News and Washington Post polls released on Monday, six out of ten Republicans are in line with Trump on immigration issues.
As long as immigration is in the spotlight, so is Donald Trump.
Discontent with the regime is at its peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are currently collecting about half of the Republican votes, and the popularity is significantly increased by the fact that both have been nominated as outsiders.
Republican troops want a fresh face instead of a political goner, according to ABC News and Washington Post's latest poll, six out of ten Republicans felt this way.
These two candidates are also angry with Washington.
According to a poll conducted by Des Moines Register and Bloomberg in Iowa, three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Republican activity in Congress: 54 percent are unhappy and 21 percent are on the verge of rage."
Jeremy Corby's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time
After the election, Corbyn's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time has been eagerly awaited
Labour Labour's new front shot, Jeremy Corbyn, is due to rise for the first time in David Cameron's Question Time.
Corbyn will ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, and the media and Labour representatives will be watching him with their eyes open.
Corbyn has called for less theatre and more facts for the weekly show.
He has also said he can skip some of the sessions and leave them to his colleagues.
Corbyn's leadership will be weighed for the first time in the context of the meeting. Corbyn will now be subject to parliamentary testing after the gathering of the shadow government and after a speech by Corbyn Trade Unions' Confederation (TUC) at its annual meeting on Tuesday.
The Labour leader's decision to remain silent during the national anthem's 75th anniversary of the British Air War on Tuesday has been criticised by several Tory party representatives, and silence has also reached the headlines of several newspapers.
Corbyn's silence during the national anthem attracted attention
Corbyn's spokesman said Corbyn stood during the national anthem, respecting in silence the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain.
However, Owen Smith, a member of Corbyn's shadow government, said in the BBC's Two's Newsnight programme that he would have urged the party leader to join the national anthem despite the anti-monarchy.
A dozen shadow ministers have refused to join Corbyn's number one team, citing differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs, and less than a sixth of the party originally supported Corbyn's election to the party leadership.
BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant considers that political disagreements about UK membership of the EU and the government's tightening of the conditions for granting benefits have piled up in Labour after Corbyn's appointment.
At the meeting of the TUC, Corbyn said Labour was going to propose changes to remove the restrictions altogether.
Hours later, shadow minister Smith said that the party's position is very clear: it only opposes the government's plans to lower the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Corbyn is the fifth Labour leader to be met by David Cameron over the past decade in the lead of Tory.
The Labour leader, who promised a new approach to politics, said he had selected the questions he would ask Cameron about the 30,000 proposals he received from the public.
According to Corbyn, elected from the constituency of Islington North, there are too many clashes at Question Time, and he promises to avoid witty lyricism and dirt throwing and instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Corbyn has said that shadow minister Angela Eagle is filling in for him during Question Time, for example when Cameron is travelling abroad.
Corbyn has also thrown out the idea that others could also come out sometimes, and he says he has discussed the matter with the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow.
After Corbyn's rise to the party leadership in 2005, Cameron said he wanted puppet theatre-like politics, often associated with Question Time, but some years later he admitted he had failed in his quest.
Since Question Time was first televised in 1990, it has been seen as a key measure of the director's judgment, control of the House of Commons and position, but according to critics, it has become a caricature that needs major reforms.
"Shot in Joburg": from homeless to young photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a challenging environment for the homeless.
A meaningful way to learn and make money has been found for the group of former street children.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit film studio where homeless young people are taught to photograph their homeland and earn at the same time.
BBC News met a young person who has been the first to graduate through the project.

The pound will be stronger as British wages rise
The pound was strengthened as wages rose in the UK, and SABMiller drew the FTSE 100 index up.
In May to July, wages in the UK rose by 2.9 per cent compared to last year's corresponding period, and bonuses were not included.
The faster growth than predicted was fastest since 2009.
The pound was strengthened by 1 per cent and its price was quoted at $1.5505 and the pound was also strengthened in relation to the euro and quoted at €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose by 1.49 per cent and reached 6,229.21 points.
The biggest increase was made by SABMiller, whose rate increased by 20 per cent when the company received a preliminary bid from a competing company AB InBev.
If the deal was implemented, the two largest brewing companies in the world would unite and bring under the same roof brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 per cent in the wake of the positive results of the competing Richemont group focused on luxury products.
Richemont's latest sales figures are better than forecast, and the development of sales was also a boost in Burberry's key market in China.
Glencore's share rose by 5 per cent after mining giants announced their plans to raise $2.5 billion with the share issue as part of their debt reduction strategy.
The packaging and paper group Mondi's shares were the biggest drop of 4.3 per cent, while Goldman Sachs dropped the company's share price for the purpose of selling.
JD Sports' rate rose 3.1 percent after the sports company announced that its profit before taxes will rise by 83 percent to £46.6 million.
JD Sports boss: higher wage costs could hamper expansion
According to Peter Cowgill, chairman of JD Sports Executive Team, raising the minimum wage in the UK would mean more purchasing power for potential customers.
However, increased purchasing power is not enough to cover higher labour costs for the company.
According to Cowgill, rising labour costs could endanger JD Sports' expansion plans and reduce the need for additional labour.
Metcash launches a grassroot campaign against Aldi's landslide
Metcash aims to secure its IGA store from Aldi's claim in southern and western Australia.
Metcash, a food wholesaler, has launched a grassroots campaign to maintain the market share of IGA retailers in South and West Australia against Aldin's $700 million invasion.
Aldi plans to open two distribution centres and the first of up to 120 stores in South and West Australia at the beginning of next year. Metcast and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build an IGA brand by marketing mainstream media and social media, and by organising events like Adelaide.
IGA stores and suppliers, as well as many brands, are part of the campaign, for example, the Dunsborough ice cream factory Simmo offers samples at IGA stores, and retailers sell tickets to regulars for South Australia football league games at a discount price.
Metcash is expected to publish more detailed information about its defence strategy on 29 September, when the food, alcohol and hardware wholesale will organise an annual investment strategy day.
This is a significant market, since South and West Australia account for nearly 30 per cent of Metcash's IGA stores' footprint, and in these areas the margin yield is higher than the Eastern state's IGA store network.
South and West Australian consumers are known for their conurbation, and IGA traders have a much larger market share in the region than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland, where the market share is 30 per cent and in Western Australia 24 per cent, while in eastern states it is only 14 per cent.
For example, Morgan Stanley analysts believe Aldi will catch 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores, which feeds on sales from all operators, but especially from those who are independent of chains.
This week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA retailers can sell 360 million and Metcash for a $250 million slot by the end of 2016.
The prediction is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South and West Australia next year, reaching $500 million and $600 million in sales in these areas.
Metcash's fixed costs are high, so the loss of food sales and volumes can mean a loss of $13 million in profit before interest and taxes, Kierath says.
At the same time, Metcast is losing market share in eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, even though according to a recent study by Roy Morgan, IGA's customers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes Metcash's food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent in 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, Magellan Financial Group's leading portfolio manager, said at an event in Melbourne, he was very likely to see Metcash disappear completely within ten years.
Metcash has refused to comment publicly on Douglass' comments.
It is understandable that a member of Metcash's board contacted Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has dropped since 2010 from 18 percent to 14 percent, and the food business of 1200 IGA retailers, Metcash, has decreased by 43 percent from 2012 levels, showing a reduction in debt financing in the face of pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler takes counter-measures and makes a $150 million a year to match Coles and Woolworths' prices for hundreds of products a week, and the chain wants to support retailers in renovating stores so that they can increase the supply of fresh products and improve the food supply of their own brands.
Metcash's CEO, Ian Morrice, said the price review and store reform plans are well under way, and the company will be able to increase its profits again in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Steve Healy, president of the Australian tennis association, defends Thanasi from Kokkinak
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves a special mention of his behaviour instead of criticism.
According to the president of the Australian tennis union, Steve Healy, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a collateral damage in a recent Nick Kyrgios-related business, and he deserves special mention instead of criticism.
Kokkinakis, the younger party of the "Special K" duo, got into an unfavorable spotlight when the bad boy Kyrgios provoked his opponent Stan Wawrinka in the Montreal ATP tournament.
Soon after that, in a qualifying match between Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison in Cincinnati, the judge had to separate the rivals twice. "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgiosis and my friend," Harrison said.
In the open U.S., Kokkinakis frustratedly hit the bat in the field when strong cramps ruined his match, and Healy has faithfully defended Kokkinaki.
At the moment, a teenage star is in Glasgow, where he fights Sam Groth for second place behind single-player Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinal against the UK.
"I strongly believe Thanasi has been dragged into the dispute," Healy said.
"He broke the bat when he lost the match in the open in the United States, and he is by no means the first player to break his bat because of frustration, and I know Thanas well enough not to be proud of what he did.
He has, however, endured very well, for example Harrison's provocative behaviour in the open in the United States, and I think he deserves recognition.
He has a strong team and a great family around him, and I think he has just been treated a little unfairly.
He's very mature to be 19, he works hard and he completes the team well, he's never had any problems with other players, he's respected among the players, he's practicing hard, he's in good condition, he's a very stable and mature young man, and I think he should be judged on his own merits."
Healy also supported the decision to drop Kyrgios Australia's team from an important round starting as a Friday, but he describes the solution as a joint decision that works for all parties, but he supports the return of Canberra's grower to a long-term confirmation of the team.
"First of all, we want to focus fully on the matches instead of the polemic associated with Kyrgios," Healy said.
Nick has risen to the top quickly, and as Federer and Murray have pointed out, the young man is growing up in the spotlight of publicity, and he deserves the criticism of his bad mistakes, but we are trying to support him in understanding the consequences of his actions, and we are also trying to give him some privacy, and I think it's best for the whole team and Nick."
European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary, which declared a state of emergency, closed its southern border from Serbia's direction on Tuesday and seized illegal immigrants to prevent the influx of migrants.
There was chaos on the border when hundreds of immigrants piled up in a non-man's country, and Serbian authorities reacted furiously.
People fleeing violence had to stay on the road between national checkpoints in their tents for an indeterminate period
Frustration began to surface.
While the police helicopter was flying in the air above the migrants, they said, "Open the border!" and shouted insults to Hungarian riot police.
Some became protesters of the eating and drinking strike.
Serbia's Foreign Minister said it did not approve of sending migrants back to Hungary at the same time as more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not add to the damage.
The situation will have to be discussed in Brussels and also in other countries in the next few days," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
Kuohunta on the Hungarian-Serbia border began a day later, when a group of 28 states failed to develop a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed, however, that the responsibility for the 40,000 influx of asylum seekers in Italy and Greece was shared, and the hope arose at the meeting that an agreement would be reached next month or by the end of the year on which EU Member States would accept 120,000 migrants, including Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened an extraordinary summit on Tuesday for the next week to discuss the continent's migrant crisis.
However, Hungary did not put its hope in the quick action of Brussels or neighbouring countries.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation developed so that authorities in two southern regions were allowed to use more effective means, i.e. to close roads and speed up asylum-related legal processes.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that Hungary is also planning a barbed wire fence on the Romanian border to prevent the flow of migrants from that direction, now that there is already a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even the prisoners participated in the finalising of the barbed wire fences between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear bottleneck for migrants and a transit point to the European Union, many of which are refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban claimed that most of the people arriving are living standards refugees, not war refugees who have the right to seek refuge, and the view strongly differs from those of other EU countries, including Germany.
In Hungary, the new law, which entered into force at midnight, says it is a crime to cross or damage a four-metre-high barbed wire fence, which the government has built on the southern border towards Serbia, and to set longer prison times for convicted traffickers.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the government declares a state of crisis," the government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told journalists in the city of Szeged in the south of the country.
"We are following a strict line: illegal border crossing is a crime."
In practice, Parliament still has to accept the military action expected next week, and the Associated Press reporters at the border have been seeing heavily armed soldiers with their vehicles and military dogs for several days now.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's internal security advisor, said the authorities have caught 45 cross-border attempts immediately at the border and 15 further away.
The people who have crossed the border by damaging the fence are now in police custody, charged with crimes under new laws.
The authorities are quick to repair the fence.
In addition, the Hungarian authorities closed two of the seven border crossing points on the Serbian border on Tuesday, one of which was closed with a train wagon covered with barbed wire.
Chaos took over the main border crossing near Roszke in Hungary when Hungarians opened a point of contact in a small metal container where people packed in.
About 20 could fit in, but thousands were left outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main street connecting Serbia and Hungary, saying they were on a eating and drinking strike until they were allowed into Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's leadership against Bernie Sanders contracted on half according to national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's support is still double-digit in the race for the Democratic national presidential candidate, but Senator Bernie Sanders has closed the gap.
Clinton's support now stands at 47 per cent of the Democratic supporters' votes (down from 58 per cent), while Sanders is second in favour of 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced his possible departure to the presidential race, and his support among the Democrats is 15 percent.
More than five months before the primary election, it is too early for most Democrats to tell which candidate they support.
Clinton's supporters, however, are more sure of their choice than those of other candidates.
Since a poll commissioned by CBS News last month, Clinton has lost the support of a number of Democratic groups, while new supporters have joined Sanders' camp.
Clinton still has strong leadership among women and moderates, but the leadership has narrowed.
Clinton's support among men has dropped significantly, and he only has a five percent bow over Sanders.
Clinton has lost his lead among the Democrats under the age of 50, and he is now even with Sanders.
Clinton, however, still has a clear advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton's head start in favor of Sanders was double-digit among liberals, but now Sanders has taken a five-point neck to Clinton in this group.
About half of the Democrats say they will be happy to support Clinton if he is elected as a party candidate.
A quarter would support Clinton with little reservations, and 15 percent would support him just because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't back Clinton.
It is no surprise that Clinton's current supporters would also be particularly enthusiastic if they were elected.
There is more disintegration among those who are not currently in favour of Clinton, and only about a quarter would be enthusiastically supporting him.
Forty-eight per cent of Democratic voters would support Clinton, while only 35 per cent of Republican voters would enthusiastically support the most popular Republican candidate Donald Trump.
When Clinton's voters are freely asked to describe why they are in favour of his candidacy, the most popular argument is Clinton's correct experience (16%), the second most popular answer being that it is time to choose a female president (13%) and, thirdly, that Clinton is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
There is also a reference to common views and opportunities to win the actual election.
The vice president still weighs his potential candidacy, and 57 percent of Democratic voters would like him to go to the race, while the third would prefer to leave him out of the race.
When the Democratic voters are asked for the second most popular candidate to be a party candidate, most choose Biden.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half of Biden is the second most popular candidate after Clinton and significantly more popular than Sanders.
If Biden doesn't go to the Democratic candidate race, Hillary Clinton will increase its head start to Sanders, with Sanders with 20 points ahead, and it will increase to 30 percent if Sanders doesn't go to the race.
55% of Democratic voters consider Clinton to be the candidate with the best chance of winning the actual election, but the percentage has fallen from 78 percent last month.
Biden, who is number two, is far from Clinton, but more and more people believe Biden can win the actual election.
Democratic voters, however, prefer the candidates' chances of winning to their views on matters of fact.
The voters do not think anyone is unacceptable about the Democratic candidates or potential candidates.
The voters consider Democratic candidates or potential candidates to be suitable for their characteristics.
Most people think Clinton, Sanders and Biden are honest, trustworthy and leadership types.
Biden is most often described as honest, while Clinton is most often considered as a leader type.
As many as 30 per cent of Democratic voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, 15 per cent say Sanders is honest. 27 per cent don't know if Sanders is honest.
Democratic voters think Clinton, Sanders and Biden's views are close to the voters' own ideology.
There is no opinion about Sanders for all characteristics in about a quarter.
When voters are asked for views on the use of Hillary Clinton's private e-mail and its own server as foreign minister, most Democratic voters say they are satisfied with Clinton's explanation and have not changed their opinion of Clinton.
The Americans more broadly disagree.
Half of the Americans are unhappy with Clinton's report, and only a third are satisfied.
The public's opinions were divided in March, when the conflict had just come to light.
A majority of Americans say that the controversial use of email has not affected their overall view of Clinton. 36 percent say that the image has changed in a negative direction.
Of this 36 percent, most, six out of ten, are Republicans.
Even though the voters of their party consider Clinton honest and trustworthy, there is room for improvement in these qualities when you ask all voters' views: Clinton thinks only 32 per cent honest and reliable, which is 8 percentage points less than last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
Sixty-two percent of all voters do not think Clinton is honest and trustworthy.
On the other hand, 55 per cent of all voters in the whole country do not think Trump is honest and trustworthy either.
But both Clinton and Trump get good grades for leadership.
Of the six candidates in the survey, Biden, Carson and Bush were considered the most reliable.
Most people think Sanders is honest, but like Carson, many people don't have an opinion about Sanders.
The survey sample is 351 voters, and the margin of error in the survey is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson closes Donald Trump's head start in a national poll
According to CBS News and New York Times' latest poll, Ben Carson has reached Donald Trump.
These two candidates gripped more than half of the votes in the new poll, leaving the other candidates far behind.
Among Republican voters across the country, Trump still has strong support, an increase from 23% in the CBS survey conducted before Fox News' debate last month, according to a poll released on Tuesday of 27%.
But Carson's support would be a huge rise in the same period, from 6% to 23%.
According to the survey, Carson has strong support in all the population groups, and in the higher education group he narrowly beats Trump.
Other candidates, except Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, remain far behind, with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's lowest support and a drop from 10 percent last month to 2 percent now.
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and Florida senator Marco Rubio shared third place with a 6% support.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters is 6 per cent one way or the other. The survey was conducted in September.
According to CNN and ORC's latest poll published last week, Carson's support is on the rise, supported by 19% of Republicans, while Trump's support is 32%.
Also in ABC News and Washington Post's latest poll, Trump was clearly ahead of Carson.
In a men's encounter last week, Trump made false accusations to a retired neurosurgeon, but Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said in his campaign in Iowa on Saturday.
Five members of the fraternity charged with the death of Baruch College freshman
Nearly two years ago, five people are charged with murder after the death of a student in the fraternity ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania.
The members of the Pi Delta Ps District of Baruch College (City University of New York) brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng at a christening in September 2013, according to the police, the club did not deliver Deng to the hospital in time, which was considered to have contributed to his death.
According to the authorities, the victim's eyes were blindfolded, his back had been packed with a 20-pound pile of sand and he had been attacked repeatedly in an attempt to reach a target placed across an icy field.
Deng is said to have complained of a headache and then passed out.
Police said members of Pi Delta Ps didn't call 911 when Deng passed out, allegedly waiting an hour before taking Deng to the hospital.
Commissioner Chris Wabner said at a press conference that the members had time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact the co-op president Andy Meng.
"At this stage, the members began to hide the equipment, putting the benefit of the club ahead of Michael Deng's health," Wagner said.
Deng could not be revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng had been hit several times in the head, torso and thighs with blunt force trauma.
"Too many families have been shocked by the student's impregnability, since at least one student a year has died as a result of the impregnation since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in his statement.
The co-operatives and their members must be held accountable, where authorities must take an important step.
Monroe County grand jury presented five members of the fraternity for third-degree murder.
In addition, 32 members of the fraternity are charged with impregnability and criminal conspiracy, including Meng.
"We want not only individuals to be held accountable, but also an organisation that officially or unofficially approved the impregnation," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College imposed a ban on the association, and the national co-op resigned from the local department.
This is how the Federal Reserve's (Fedin) interest rate increase is affected
The raising of interest rates and the boom in the stock market are groping, securities returns are rising and the economy is sliding into recession.
We know that.
On the other hand, we do not know how long everything will take and how long the effects will last.
Especially with regard to the economy, we find in history an indication of timing.
The recession has arrived up to 11 months after the first rate increase and lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank often aggressively raises interest rates, not always, but the key factor is how the economy and financial assets react.
That is why the central bank officials have already been so stressed that investors are not paying attention when the interest rate increases begin, but how long it will take to normalise the situation.
There are, of course, a number of variables involved.
In the end, however, market players can see that all the fuss about raising interest rates can be exaggerated.
"The first withdrawal of the Central Bank after the global financial crisis was undoubtedly often interpreted as a sign of the end of cheap money," Julian Jessop, Chief Economics chief global economicist told his customers.
On the other hand, we are not expecting a gradual normalisation of interest rates to a relatively low level, which is a frightening seismic shock for many.
That does not mean, however, that there are no effects.
Here are examples based on historical trends of how the effects can be reflected in different economic areas:
As has been seen in the market for about a month, the anticipation of interest rate increases can increase instability for a while.
When interest rates finally rise, the effect is not so dramatic.
"Trend seems to be the halting of interest income on capital after the first raise for 12-24 months, possibly reflecting a delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analyst said in a recent study of the consequences of the interest rate rise.
A sharp increase, about 14 per cent, is generally seen in the market during the 35-year period, with a relatively steady increase for the next 250 days (average increase of 2.6 per cent), after 500 days the situation normalises, and the average rate of return after six stock cycles is 14.4 per cent, says Bob Doll, the Chief equity strategist Barron's newspaper of Nuveen Asset Management.
According to Deutsche, the impact on the shares tends to increase slightly later in the cycle and interest income begins to decrease.
The recession is a fact in the economy, but the rise in interest rates usually works on it.
In this case, if the Fed meets conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate the downturn.
Especially noteworthy is the fact that gross domestic product is at its lowest ever in view of raising the central bank's steering rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, 118 in the increase in the steering rate since 1950, only twice has the nominal value been below 4.5 per cent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 shows 3.6 per cent, many did not think it would last, and the third quarter is 1.5 per cent, says Atlanta Regional Central Bank.
In raising interest rates in such a delicate economic situation, there may be risks and it may be asked whether this situation is different, Deutsche said.
The market players have been talking about raising the steering rate all year, and the eyes turn to the meeting of this week's Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
Many strategists and economists believe that even if the open market committee approves the withdrawal at this meeting, futures trade only shows a 25 percent probability.
"In our studies since 1950, all the lift cycles to this day have been in a super cycle, where GDP falling also before the recession will rise very quickly after the economic upturn began," the report said.
The recovery has been very slow compared to the worst recession in the control season.
The cycle is clearly the longest, which the Fed has waited for since the last recession, and the record had been 35 months, and it's already going to be 74.
Also fixed-income securities have been unstable in the market's outlook for interest rate hikes, and the pattern is repeated also on the capital side.
"The underlying difference is that the impact in bonds is faster than in shares when the central bank changes the rate.
In the case of bonds, the return seems to change direction immediately as the first up/down cycle begins.
At the end of the rising cycle, profits will fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that interest rate lifting will cause long-term and short-term bonds to approach each other and level the curve.
"In an environment like this, high-yield bonds often do better, even though we are still cautious about returns," said Kathy Jones, Schwab's analyst on fixed-yield securities.
Fascinatingly enough, Jones said the market has already adapted to the future change in the Central Bank's direction.
"In addition to the appreciation of the dollar and inflation forecasts, there are already several signs of a tightening of financial policy adaptation," Jones said.
Short-term interest rates are rising, the yield curve is straight, credit risk margins have expanded and volatility has increased, all of which are typical of the market in a situation where the central bank is tightening policy.
Broadly speaking, companies that are mainly active in the US market will benefit because interest rates are falling and local products are becoming attractive.
The outlook for the indebted multinationals is weaker, as a stronger dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market and the debt more expensive.
"History shows that quality shares will be more profitable in the next three months," Goldman Sachs analysts tell their customers.
Companies with a strong balance sheet beat the weak balance sheet companies by an average of five percentage points after interest rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with a high return on capital and low volatility shares also did better than quality, with an average of 4 and 3 percentage points better.
"Word is a big question.
Companies with a significant share of variable rate debt lose the most," Goldman said.
Outside the stock market, consumers usually also benefit from the dollar's strengthening.
The savers also benefit from higher returns, though experts disagree on how quickly the effects will be visible.
Parliamentary election Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM
Conservative Andrew Bingham criticised the radio station for being too popular.
Bingham said it is difficult to separate the channel from its commercial competitor today.
Also claims that the BBC Music Awards are just a copy of the Brits Awards.
Parliamentary Commissioner Damien Collins, on the other hand, accuses The Voice of impersonality.
According to a prominent parliamentarian, BBC Radio 3 is gradually turning into a copy of Classic FM, which increases the pressure on the station to prove that it offers more than just each commercial radio station.
Conservative Andrew Bingham also told BBC leadership that the broadcaster's radio channel is becoming too populist and that the channel is hardly separated from its commercial rival.
"I don't want to talk about popularisation, but Radio 3 seems to be changing towards Classic FM," Bingham said.
The BBC Music Awards, which took place last December, is also criticised by Bingham:
"The BBC Music Awards held for the first time last year appear to be a copy of the Brits Awards.
These two are examples of just copying what is already on the market instead of new and different," Bingham says.
The BBC Director-General denied the accusations and said that BBC Radio 3 offers much more live music and enlightening content than a commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 taught me something about classical music that I can't learn from other channels.
The channel's commitment to live music and music making is in its own class.
I also think it is important that Radio 3 is also committed to finding new music and ordering new works," the director-general said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 director Alan Davey said that the station needs to work even harder to keep the public interested, as the British know classical music even better.
However, Radio 3 is not the only BBC channel that has been criticised for entering hard commercial channels during the hearing of a restricted Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Tory MP Damien Collins criticised the "The Voice" talent-hunting contest that BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media, estimated at £22 million.
"The programme is not much discussed, because it is not unique or particularly distinctive."
According to Lord Hall, the BBC1's star judges Paloma Faith and Boy George were produced in a manner typical of the BBC.
In addition, Collins insisted that the company find a hit show in its own stable next time it launches a new entertainment series.
However, Collins refused to rule out the fact that the Voice series would continue to be ordered or that taxpayers' money would be spent on other entertainment formats.
The slowest growth in e-commerce ever in August - perhaps because of black Friday
In the first months of 2015, online trade grew by seven per cent.
Online sales have been recorded since 2000, and last month the growth was the slowest ever.
The online shop was strengthened three years ago with mobile purchasing.
Experts believe that November's black Friday can curb buying tendencies.
For more than ten years, the conquest of the online store has left many of Britain's shopping streets desolate.
According to experts, there are indications that the online trade is levelling out, and the new sales figures show only a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
In August, the growth in total sales was slowest during the whole period, when online sales have been recorded, i.e. since 2000, and last year, online sales only grew by five per cent.
According to experts, there are indications that the online trade is levelling out, and the new sales figures show only a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If you compare last year's growth to 2000 figures, it is clear that the growth will stabilise over time," IMRG editor Andy Mulcahy told the Guardian.
According to Mulcahy, the online store accelerated three years ago when consumers accepted mobile purchasing.
"It made it possible for more people to buy online, and for many people it was possible to buy in a different environment, for example from a home couch.
As mobile purchasing is now more moderate, growth can stabilise."
Black Friday, from America, is a phenomenon that is seen as one of the reasons for slowing down growth.
According to experts, the theme day on the last Friday of November may cause consumers to postpone the purchase decision before black Friday.
Last year, five times the number of online buyers compared to normal caused many retailers' websites to fall.
Experts believe that black Friday, which causes consumers to crowd in after offers, can curb buying tendencies during the rest of the time.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, a good pound for every five pounds was spent online.
More than a third of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, are purchased online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of shopping street fashion shops.
Mecca burys the victims of crane accidents, Bin Laden family responsible
The Muslims carried the bodies of 29 victims on the streets when the first funeral takes place in Mecca.
According to Saudi Arabia, the big construction company Saudi Binladin Group is part of the blame for the accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were also injured after the crane fell.
The bodies were carried high in the air as Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the crane that fell on Mecca's Grand Mosque
There were crowds of white-dressed people gathered on the streets to say good-bye to the victims on their last journey to Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The mournful convoy went to a pilgrimage site, where the crash crane had only a day earlier penetrated the mosque's roof over the Muslims.
The king of Saudi Arabia demands that Bin Laden's construction family company be held accountable for the accident, which also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 victims killed in Mecca's Grand Mosque crane accident were transported on the streets.
After the crane fell, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Suur-Manchester, was among the dead, who had travelled to Mecca on his first pilgrimage.
Akram had been to Suur Mosque with his parents, who were about to begin their annual Hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have promised that the Hajj pilgrimage will take place when thousands of people are arriving in the city for the pilgrimage.
According to King Salman, Binladin Group should not have left the crane boom up when the crane was not used.
According to a press release in Arabic, Binladin Group is partly responsible for the accident.
The news agency's English service did not report in detail, but according to a press release in English, the Group's management has been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall in the Grand Mosque yard. Thousands of Muslims are heading for the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not published a notice about the crane accident, and the group representatives have not been reached for an opinion.
The king also accused the group of failing to comply with up-to-date safety regulations and to cooperate with meteorology experts.
Tens of cranes surround Mecca's Suurmaskeijja as part of Binladin Group's giant construction project.
For decades the Bin Laden family has had close ties with Saudi Arabia's ruling family, and the Bin Ladens are responsible for several major construction projects.
Al Qaeda's late leader, Osama bin Laden, was an apostate son who had been abandoned by his family in the 1990s.
A crane accident in heavy rain and heavy wind occurred just a few days before the pilgrimage to Mecca, which is the duty of every capable Muslim to do at least once in a lifetime.
According to the authorities, 158 people are still in hospital.
The authorities ordered one million rials (about €250,000) to be paid to the victims' relatives and permanently disabled.
Others injured in the accident receive half of the compensation.
According to B&Q boss, the phenomenon is driven by cheap Eastern European workforce
The Britons hire generals more often than before, says Veronique Laury.
The popularity has been increased by skilled, self-employed workers arriving from Eastern Europe.
More than 200 new Screwfix stores for workers will be opened.
Meanwhile, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores around the country.
Text: Rupert Steiner, main correspondent, Daily Mail
Brits are said to transfer home hammering and painting jobs to people arriving from Eastern Europe.
Vasarising and painting skills seem to be few these days.
The British now hire more and more generals in the home to manage the home's sniveling work, says the head of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury is the new CEO in Kingfisher, who owns a chain of home-repairing supplies, and says that this phenomenon is based on skilled workers from Eastern Europe who offer services at affordable prices.
As a result of the phenomenon, Kingfisher plans to open up 200 new stores of Screwfix for traders, with 60 B&Q stores closing.
Laury needs more female labour in B&Q stores, since eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are made by a woman.
At the moment, most of the staff are men.
According to Laury, the demographic trends should be noted, as more and more women living alone are also renovating their homes.
"Our sales staff are still mostly men," said Laury.
"We need to balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80 per cent of the purchase decisions are made by a woman.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of five women who are in the helm of British FTSE 100 companies, and has also restructured the company's management team so that there is a balance between male and female leaders.
Kingfisher is almost the only one of its kind, as 50 per cent of its staff are women, including the CEO and the CFO.
"This was a conscious decision, and diversity is an important topic for us," said Laury.
"It hasn't been hard to find good women for the leadership."
Kingfisher's six-month operating profit and sales figures are down, even though the company worked hard after closing the stores.
Kingfisher responds to current trends: the company owns the Screwfix and B&Q chains and plans to open 200 new stores.
The three aces government decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
The visible effects were obtained quite quickly.
The sharp head of SAK and other employee centre organisations began to force immediately, and as a result, the country stands on Friday because of the workers' widespread demonstration.
A lot of people think that there is also reason at that time.
Let's see if it's a good idea to strike when things are going badly.
Even the resistance movement has been set up.
More than 50,000 people have already been online to announce that they are not going to take part in the demonstration but are going to work.
In an old time of good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no internet to protest about, but openly declaring a criminal would have been a small person's political suicide.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of millions of trade unions does not give much thought, but it gives cause for thought.
The status of the trade union movement is no longer as obvious as it was a couple of decades ago.
Not everyone knows the movement's goals as their own, the values have changed
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay movement, the government's harsh solutions can also be seen as a direct celestial gift.
When things have seemed to roll in their own weight for years, now the unions finally get to the point of defending the employee's rights, visiblely and properly.
In this way, the government may want to incarcerate the role of the AY movement, as membership of the trade union may be seen as more necessary than before.
Whatever you think of the organisations' actions, it's nonsense that Friday's demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has already stopped long ago.
For example, industrial output has been falling for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product will continue to decline, and unemployment will rise.
These things should force everyone's mind.
Lappeenranta University's hard-earned savings: The goal is to save 8.5 million, with 130 staff cuts
Lappeenranta University of Technology begins a savings course with the goal of reducing costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start negotiations on the whole staff, with a savings target of 6.5 million annually.
In practice, it means reducing about 130 employees.
In addition, two million will be saved from other activities.
The background to the Yt negotiations is the 2016 budget, which anticipates a real deficit of 8.5 million.
It is also affected by the government's budget cuts.
In this financial year, the university will result in a deficit of about 2.6 million.
The costs will increase slightly next year, but at the same time the funding from the Ministry will decrease by 2 million and the rest will decrease by 3.2 million euros.
The university's total budget is about 85 million euros, so the savings target is 10 per cent of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive cuts in education and research and the reduction in corporate funding for our university is very significant, says Principal Anneli Pauli in a university press release.
Before the summer, the impact of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in additional funding appears in new proportions.
The negotiations with the shop stewards will start on Tuesday next week and they will last the six weeks laid down by the law.
Yle: Onnibus wants to use Finnish railways
The owner of the cheap bus company Onnibus, British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company is also aiming for rail traffic in Finland.
I am very interested in joining Finnish rail traffic.
My Stagecoach company is one of Britain's largest railway companies, Souter says.
Rail transport should gradually open up to competition.
First up is local traffic in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in 2017-2018.
After commuter traffic, long-distance traffic is on the line.
Souter says he has already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes Onnibus plans.
At least Transdev (formerly Veolia), who also has bus traffic in Finland and rail traffic elsewhere in Europe, has expressed interest in other international companies for rail traffic.
U.S. Central Bank's interest rate decision time
The whole world is following a meeting of the Federal Reserve of the United States, Fed, on Wednesday and Thursday, to decide on a possible increase in interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
Fair half of economists who believed last week the Fed would raise interest rates now bet that the Fed would maintain interest rates at the current 0-0.25 percent, as shown by a survey conducted by the 80 economists in Reuters.
"It's a historical situation, because the Fed has kept the interest rate close to zero for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a significant central bank can raise interest rates from zero, thus triggering the normalisation of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has been relatively good, and recovery has brought trillions of extra dollars to the balance sheet and only slightly accelerated inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore a global situation that is less rosy.
It has urged the market to prepare for change, but there are also indications of the opposite.
The decision is due to be announced on Thursday at 20.00 Central European time.
Delta State University shooter left an apology note
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning – before a colleague was shot later that day – Shannon Lamb wrote a note apologizing for the first murder and hoping to cancel it, the authorities said on Tuesday.
Lamb, who teaches geography and social science at Delta State University in Gautier, Mississippi, called 911 about 10 a.m.
Monday, he said he shot someone.
Lamb called 911 and asked the police to come home.
"I shot my wife last night," Lamb said, and he also mentioned that there was a friendly dog in the house that didn't hurt anyone but was probably scared.
The police asked for the caller's name, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb didn't give any motive for the shooting either.
The police arrived at the scene and found Amy Prentiss, 41, the body, and Lamb's handwritten note saying: "I'm very sorry and I wish I could cancel what I did.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me.
After writing the message, Lamb drove 500 kilometres to Delta State University, where he killed history professor Ethan Schmidt before taking his own life late Monday when the police reached him.
University principal William LaForge said he wasn't aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but said that something was clearly bothering Lamb.
On Monday, it was reported that Lamb supposedly believed Prentiss was also romantically involved with Schmidt, but authorities announced on Tuesday that there was no information or evidence about the triangle.
Shawn O'Steen, married to Prentiss for seven years, described his former wife as a good person.
The couple had divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter who is upset.
The man said the daughter and mother were best friends.
According to Sun Herald, a close friend of Prentiss Lindsay Knowles said Prentiss worked online from home.
Knowles said Prentiss had been dating Lamb for about three years, and he also told about a woman's dog named Lightning.
"He always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
According to police, Lamb had called relatives during Monday and told them he was not going to jail.
When the police reached Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville on the same night, Lamb stopped the car, fled on foot, ran into the woods and took his own life.
According to the CV on the university's website, Lamb received doctorates in education at Delta State University in spring 2015.
dimmed stars
The last few years have been hard for the actor (in the picture with his son Redmond on the left).
In 2001, he fought leukemia, and in 2009, his long-time partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The actor has also struggled with drugs, and in 2008, he was arrested for possession of drugs.
Everything that has happened has really taken its toll.
Manchester United Luke Shaw on the sidelines for months because of two fractures
Luke Shaw's right leg was broken in Manchester United Champions League match against PSV Eindhoven.
The defender is sad to have to stand aside for at least six months, but Louis van Gaal is still hopeful and believes Shaw will return to the fields this season.
20-year-old Shaw was injured in the PSV defence area in a bad tackle by Héctor Moreno, while 15 minutes were in progress.
Shaw was given first aid in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he could be transferred to the hospital.
"Shaw has two fractures on his leg and is hospitalized," Van Gaal said.
Shaw will be transferred tomorrow or the day after for surgery to Manchester.
The young man who joined Manchester United at 18 has been hard and is now offended by the great game grips.
In the locker room, Shaw was given oxygen.
The man was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but when a leg breaks in two places, he's on the sidelines for half a month and no longer playing in the block phase.
I hope he can still play this season.
Moreno seemed to have barely got away with the red-card kick.
The judge of the match, Nicola Rizzoli, did not punish the Mexican player.
Van Gaal said the Italian judge made a mistake.
"You can judge for yourself, but I thought it was worth a penalty kick and a red card.
It was a two-foot tackle.
Shaw tweeted: "Thank you all for your messages. I can't tell you how overwhelmed I am. My recovery begins here and I'm coming back stronger."
More on the subject: Manchester United's Luke Shaw aside in the PSV match
The English defender has a special reason to recover to compete in the European Championships in France in June.
"It's a very bad injury," said PSV coach.
"In such injury situations, all parties are always very sorry.
It is never the intention of the players to harm the opponent."
Moreno broke his legs while playing in the Mexican ranks in the Van Gaal-led Netherlands only in the 2014 World Championships.
"He's very sorry, because he didn't mean to hurt the opponent, and I'm sorry to hear that the injury is serious," Cocu said.
"I didn't see the situation myself.
All I saw was a ball going the other way, so it looked like he (Moreno) touched the ball, but I didn't see Luke tackle."
"I know how it feels, and I know how difficult this can be," Moreno said to SBS6.
"I feel really bad, and I'm very sorry."
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
David Cameron should know Lorax better
Before long, every parent will notice that a child learns his favourite book almost by heart.
Except for the David Cameron you saw.
When the children's holiday organisation asked Cameron to name his favourite children's books, the prime minister chose Lorax, a teaching environmental story by Dr. Seuss, published in 1971.
In a text published on SuperCamp website, Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. "The story is funny, touching and creative, and there is a powerful message in it, and I like to read it to my children because there's always a picture or a message we haven't noticed before."
Sounds good, except that the next part where Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book is a summary of the 2012 film version, adding new characters and details to complete a shorter initial text.
"In the city of Aluville, where the real trees and plants have disappeared, and even the air is a commodity, there is a boy named Ted, who wants to get into the heart of her dream girl Audrey by fulfilling this biggest dream: to see the real tree," the text says. In the 1991 dead version of Dr. Seuss Geisel, Ted had no crush.
If this is not suspicious enough, Cameron's text is partly consistent with the plot summary of the Lorax movie on the Internet Movie Database, starting with: "In a city where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, there is a boy named Ted, who wants to get into the heart of her dream girl Audrey."
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the plot of the book will be so foreign to him. Greedy Kerskanen will destroy trees and make supplies of them despite the resistance of the name character Lorax, a small, thick creature with a mustache that protects the forests.
Likely a PR mission of minor importance has been entrusted to an assistant, apparently someone who has not read Lorax 20 times in a row as a child.
The Prime Minister's representative said the text probably originated from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps did not comment further on the matter, but confirmed that the text was Cameron's staff handwriting.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being off the English team, but it is still hard
The encounter with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but once we have seen the last 3-0 test series defeat of England on the tour, it is not expected.
I wouldn't rule out the possibility of a guest victory.
Alastair Cook's side may be more inexperienced than the team three years ago, but the team has good players and their attitude is strong - they don't have bad experiences from 2012, just youthful positivity.
As a balled player, Moeen Ali develops as a spiral pitcher, and Adil Rashid, even though he does not have Test-level experience, represents an attack option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from England's Test Team and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth out is obviously hard for me to understand as his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven Tests have been two good attacks under challenging conditions, and the simple and cruel truth is that cricket players are judged according to the results.
For example, Joe Root is not a questionable choice because, as I have said before, players are the best voters.
A few 50-point matches would have been on Lyth's team, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets another chance when he hits Yorkshire with more runs.
Britain's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, also praised his attitude when he did not do as well as he could, which does not surprise me, and he is above all a team player.
The question of how long the Test-beater will have the opportunity to make an impression is difficult.
Lyth got seven national matches, like his predecessor Sam Robson, while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got an opportunity in both domestic and foreign matches.
Perhaps the only complaint is that England first used Jonathan Trot in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in top shape - but this missed opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales will be on the team, and he's a hitter I appreciate high.
He is a cricket player of an unknown author, which we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he scored 236 points against us on Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this, of course, depends on the composition of the United Arab Emirates team.
The idea has been thrown into the air that Moe will start batting with Cook, so we can get an extra spin pitcher into the game while having four fast pitchers, and I'm not against the idea.
I don't see any obstacle to the fact that the top pitcher could be hitting here, and this left-handed player has already proved to be a great cricket player.
Moeen may not have done much in his local team in Worcestershire, but he has been the team's third player, and that is no big difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Test matches as the first replacement player to start in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points, and there was no turning back.
Zafar Ansari is on the team as a back-up pitcher, and from what I've seen about him, he has proved to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his statistics - an average of 31 points as a hitter and 35 as a pitcher - and this could be a long shot, but not many spin pitchers have shown themselves to be ready, and the voters decided to take a young player.
He will learn a lot during this match trip.
Outside the playing team, England seems to have made a couple of intelligent choices for its coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, Sri Lanka's hitter, as an advisor to Test matches, can be a breakthrough.
This is one of the sweetest men of the sport, who brings a lot of experience because he has played under all kinds of conditions and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to the part of the white ball on the gaming trip, bringing both energy and ruthlessness.
I think he has always seemed to fit in with international cricket, whether he is a player or a coach, and, like Mahela, he has the intelligence to use.
Sometimes a new voice in the dressing room, even if it says the same thing as before, can be a boost.
Colly's teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, has rested in one-day matches, Root has had a similar opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Even though not everyone agrees, coaches and voters do not set a match schedule.
And it must be borne in mind that like the players, their job depends on the results.
These decisions are never made without consideration.
Brexit camp can win if the economy is in bad shape in 2017
David Cameron's half-way renegotiation strategy for Britain's stay in the EU is in a deeper and deeper swamp every day, even without the attractive Jeremy "yes or no" Corbynia's election to Labour or TUC's harshly mocking Europe on Tuesday.
Other countries also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farage.
A European diplomat recently explained how many crises the EU is wringing - even though not everyone is a personal act - and some Member States are fed up with Britain's self-righteous agenda, which includes concessions that cause disagreement and damaging Treaty changes that they do not really want.
In Brighton, the annual TUC Congress decided that they would not be comfortable in the EU either, if that would break social security.
We could call it a selfie agenda for Dave and George, for example.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor hang out at summits and bilateral talks in the capitals of different countries, catch a picture of themselves in front of a famous monument, with or without high-ranking people, return home and say they've acquired allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an open-minded Britain inside the EU tent. "Don't leave us alone with France," Berlin says, suggesting that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in different capitals have come to the point that they don't care if we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany's rational Chancellor is an ally, but has been in power for ten years and wants to leave the office before it deteriorates, as happened to those who stayed too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French François Hollande faces a re-election or a successor in 2017.
His power is waning, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, while Spain has a left-wing government.
It's hard to imagine them running to help selfie Britons who could use their energy better to stop Scotland from leaving the UK, and they don't want it either, because most people have separatist tendencies.
Some of these ministers can plan to deliberately throw useless comments in the Scottish National Party style in the British national election campaign for 2017 to speed up Brexit's process, my friend suggests.
"The renegotiations were a set-up, and there was nothing left of Britain's hand in the renegotiations."
Europeans know how the British press hunts and how the EU-sceptic oligarch press is, just like Tony Benn's 1975 referendum, with a result of 2:1 in favour of joining the EU in 1973.
Someone may have a distant memory of Boris Johnson, a Euro-opportunist who became known as our "EU Direct Banana correspondent" in Brussels in the early 90s.
At least Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They include tax-bounds, cell phone hacks, and apparently temporary residents who own most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair felt roughly the same way about them, but then realized that when you're in a cage with a rough gorilla, you have to hand out bananas as a distraction so that the gorilla doesn't eat you for lunch and dinner.
Miliband was even more blairier than Blair when he opposed the referendum, because Blair agreed to the EU constitution, which was then rejected, and when France and the Netherlands rejected the treaty in the referendum in 2005, Blair got away with it.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly patted me on the back at Westminster on Monday, I told him he no longer has time to waste on me, and there may be a risk that he will introduce Neil Kinnock's media boycott strategy from the '80s, which was a mistake and still is.
It may take time, but Corbyn needs to develop a consistent strategy for dating the media, not with me, but Andrew Marrin, on whose BBC couch he sat on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what we politely call constructive.
He says he wants to keep us in a reformed EU.
Most people outside Ukipi and Tory can probably say yes to this.
That's what Hilary "Benn but not Bennit" Benn told on radio and television this week, when his inner boy scout tried not to admit that it was a bad move for Corbyn to call rugged John McDonnell as shadow finance minister.
It reminded me of the 70s, when his old father had difficulty in being on television disloyal to his Labour colleagues without going too far and losing his place in the House of Commons.
Hilary's difficulties were more interesting.
Mr Benn said he was against staying in the EU "in all circumstances", and Mr McDonnel did not say that to his colleagues and members of the House of Commons at a private meeting on Monday evening.
He wanted Corby to pass on a sweet picture no matter how, we have to remember that he even touched me, and communication discipline is important in the 24/7 era, especially in the social media discipline, where paranoia and fraud are smoldering.
Cameron does not need to be given a free pass for the EU to take Labour's support for granted in a referendum, as McDonnell has said.
At least this is what Simon Jenkins thinks.
McDonnell and Corbyn's equivocation of EU membership is suitable for the Bennite blockade economy and the anti-Capital past, which no longer belong to a narrow circle of left-wing dissidents, to whom the idea that similarity unites, is a central doctrine in the doctrineal struggles.
There has also been an equivocation of NATO, and Tom Watson is unshakable that Corbyn is not campaigning for departure, and foreign diplomats are forced to try to clarify the matter in their own countries.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they have suspicious voters - why should they give concessions to Britain when everything can be in vain?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the British's miserable military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even the cuts of the Tory government, which I was reminded of on Monday in connection with the launch of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticized the British authorities' statements about e-cigarettes
According to researchers, the state-funded institution's claims that smoking e-cigarettes is 95 per cent less harmful than traditional smoking arose at a meeting of 12 participants linked to the tobacco industry.
Experts criticized the evidence presented by the Public Health England (PHE) public health authority in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and Lancet Medical Journal in the report on e-cigarettes.
PHE described his report last month as "a revolutionary and comprehensive review of the results."
However, several researchers have questioned the certainty of the information and highlighted the links of some experts to the tobacco industry.
Last month's Lancet Medical Journal editorial took on teeth a "significantly mild foundation", based on which PHE's most important conclusion is based.
In addition, two researchers in the BMJ have wondered whether the claims were based on "rock or sand."
The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine professor of European public health, Martin McKee, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, have said: "The basic assumption of public health is that the policies are based on clear evidence of their effectiveness."
According to McKee and Capewell, the general public assumes that the PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes" should be based on detailed analysis and modelling of research results.
The claim comes from a single meeting of 12 people convened to develop a model based on multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), which sought to unify the views of the participants about the disadvantages of nicotine products, and the results of the meetings were gathered in a study.
According to McKee and Capewell, EuroSwiss Health was one of the supporters of the meeting, whose CEO's previous independent research has been funded by British American Tobacco (BAT), according to sources.
In addition, the CEO demonstrated in the sustainability report his support for BAT's public health performance.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting granted funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but the alleged previous funding from Philip Morris International did not.
There is no explanation of the selection criteria for the panel's composition, but there are a number of well-known e-cigarette supporters, some of whom admit their involvement as an industrial funder.
Some of the participants, however, are not known about their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE's tobacco manager.
According to McKee and Capewell, the group's study report shows that there is no indisputable evidence that the products are harmful to a large part of the products and that they meet their criteria.
However, links or shortcomings are not mentioned in the PHE report.
According to the PHE report, so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes can promote smoking among children or non-smokers, which McKee and Capewell consider premature.
According to Professor Kevin Fenton, PHE's Director of Health and Welfare, the claims have been answered earlier.
According to Fenton, e-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than traditional smoking.
Every other person who smokes through life dies because of tobacco addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are lower than those of traditional tobacco, but the long-term effects need to be further investigated.
PHE is obliged to inform the public what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially in a situation where the relative risks compared to traditional tobacco are unclear.
In the UK, there are nearly 80,000 deaths related to smoking every year, and smoking costs public health £2 billion a year.
Responsible behaviour requires us to make clear the current evidence that e-cigarettes are not a risk-free option, but the harm they cause is a fraction of the harm to traditional tobacco.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says Channel 4 boss
Luke Johnson, head of Channel 4, said the BBC should stop broadcasting certain programs, including EastEnders and The Voice, and according to Johnson, commercial rivals would give their right hand to hit series like Albert Square.
According to Johnson, the licence fee should only be used to make programs that other television stations do not do.
He criticised BBC for presenting programmes likely to reach a smaller audience at the same time as competitors' big ratings programmes, as well as for example on BBC4.
After the BBC president Tony Hall announced that the company wants to increase cooperation with other organisations, Johnson said he had spent six years trying to get Channel 4 to work with the BBC without success.
"I do not agree with the idea that the BBC buys formats and broadcasts programmes that are clearly part of a competing channel's software," Johnson told the House of Lords' Communications Committee, which explained the future of the BBC.
If the BBC wants to keep a broadcasting fee, which I do not think is necessarily a good idea in the medium to long term, it should at least reduce its offer to programmes that are not produced and purchased by others.
The BBC will send The Voice to its best time, because it wants the broadest possible support in the future.
If no other channel will accept the program, it is clearly ridiculous nonsense.
"I don't understand why a regressive tax should fund programmes that could be funded without subsidies," Johnson said.
The Voice is one of these, the EastEnders is the other, even though it is its own production.
Many channels would give their right hand for it.
I do not understand how this serves the services of the broadcaster.
I don't think these would be a loss to the BBC."
Johnson is a serial entrepreneur who was in charge of Channel 4 in 2004-2010, and he thinks the BBC is looking for good ratings because there are ambitious people working in the company and because they believe it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson's comments on the BBC's most popular shows are similar to those of former Sky boss Tony Ball, who proposed in his MacTaggart lecture in 2003 that the BBC sell out series like EastEnders.
According to Johnson, the BBC's Niche programmes are shown on BBC4, where ratings are not usually measured, but the programmes fulfil their purpose. "BNC can say, when defending £4 billion in broadcasting fees with its hypocritical missions, that it has made special programmes that no one watched."
"BBBC presents them at times when no one will ever see them."
Johnson said about the broadcasting fees: "I challenge you to find another system that is just as old-fashioned in the sense that who gets the best out of it.
Of course, everyone thinks £150 a year is cheap, but the people to whom it is a big sum, especially if the BBC is hardly looked at."
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who also told his own views in committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should exchange its ancient missions for new "information, teaching and entertainment."
According to Elstein, the BBC's current supply is unlikely to have syllabus - 1 per cent on TV and 0.1 per cent on radio - adding that the BBC should learn from Australian and Canadian broadcasters and re-enact its mission: "to inform, enlighten and entertain."
On the question of cooperation, Elstein suggests that the BBC could increase the coverage of events such as the Proms festival, where only a fraction of the concerts were broadcast last year. "BBC should also join the alliances with commercial channels to make the whole offer available online," he continues.
Brain cells can be controlled by sound waves using sonogenetics
The video shows how the nematode changes direction when it is subjected to ultrasound.
Researchers have grown worms that have genetically modified their nervous system, so they can be controlled by ultrasound.
Small nematodes change direction when subjected to ultrasound with a frequency above the hearing range of the human ear.
Sound waves activate motion nerve cells that have been genetically modified to have a transport membrane that reacts to ultrasound.
More on the topic: Researchers monitor brain activity with light
According to researchers, the worms were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new sonogenetics method, which uses the ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells with an stimulus from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher of Salk Instute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the method can one day replace deep-brain stimulation (DBS), a invasive method used to treat Parkinson's disease symptoms that stimulates the brain with electrical impulses.
The shuttles normally don't react to ultrasound, but Chalasani noticed that the worms are beginning to react when they are placed in a liquid with microscopic bubbles.
According to Chalasan, the bubbles amplify ultrasound waves that move inside the worms.
Strengthened ultrasound waves affect TRP4 ion channels, which are found in parts of the cell membranes of the worms.
According to an article in Nature Communications, sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells to which they are attached.
To control the nematodes with ultrasound, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of the nerves that control their movement appeared in TRP4 ion channels.
When ultrasound was directed to modified worms, microbubbles strengthened sound waves and moved to the worms, causing a signal to start in the nerve cell.
The method is somewhat similar to optogenetics, which is a revolutionary tool that allows researchers to activate nerve cells with light.
According to Chalasan, however, sonogenetics have certain advantages over optogenetics.
Light is directed to the brain being studied using optical fibers, while low-frequency ultrasounds easily penetrate the cell, so ultrasound can be directed to the brain through the skull.
"We believe that genetic and viral therapy will allow human nerve cells to be temporarily exposed to ultrasound signals in the clinical environment in certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
According to the researcher, the method could also be used in muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture equipment - on your doorstep!
Advertising is a disgrace to the British arms trade
Watch Amnesty International's anti-armament fair video.
Creepy killer missiles!
Leghold traps breaking ankles!
Grape bombs!
Remote extinguishers that cause unbearable pain but leave no trace!
A joyful voice and cartoons clearly reveal that this advert of the world's largest arms fair is parody, produced by Amnesty International, with the aim of highlighting the British government's attempt to sell arms to repressive regimes at the DSEI (Defence Security and Equipment International), which is held at the ExCel exhibition centre in Docklands, London.

There are also posters to the bus stops and metro cars that require a second look.
"Important announcement: will you be on the subway from 15 to 18 September?" The announcement resembles London Metro's announcements, a picture of a tanker on the other side of the metro line.
"In September, a group of arms dealers will arrive in Docklands, and customers will be asked for help to put an end to the gun fair."
Three hundred posters have been made by artists whose works were displayed at the Banksy Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped distribute posters across London with a six-pound "adspace hacking package" with hexagon keys that allegedly have access to about a third of the world's bus stop poster stands.
Transport for London is not a joke about poster vandalism.
One of the prank ads of the Special Patrol Group.
According to Cruel Designs curator and Essex University lecturer Gavin Grindon, artists have begun to question things and want to bring their political work to the public outside the galleries.
Artists have found that social influence through art requires that art be brought to the real world, and many move to work with protest activists.
One of the anti-arms posters greets public transport users on the subway.
Amnesty's video has been watched over 100,000 times in a day via Facebook, designed without compensation by the advertising agency VCCP, and both the graphic designer and the narration have also done their work without compensation.
VCCP's artistic director Matt Lever shrugged about the absence of fair advertising and the empty spot in ExCeL's event calendar, saying, "Let's give them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They tried to make a more realistic, obscure corporate video, but bright colors and animation attract more attention."
"They've done a great job and helped us bring up fairs where there is an illegal trade in torture equipment," says Amnesty Tom Davies.
"Now the government must take action to ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded on our doorstep."
But perhaps the most creative feature of the gun fair is on display in the exhibition halls of ExCeL itself, where exhibitors use fantastic euphemisms about their merchandise.
In a press release, Saab announced an order from the U.S. military for "Traffic AT4CS RS."
The product includes a "specially designed warhead that effectively penetrates the target."
That doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight golden rules for those living in student dormitories
I moved to a student dorm 11 years ago, an innocent 19-year-old who still believed in berets and moral relativism, and only now do I remember the forced smiles of those I irritated and the countless long complaints about others.
The most important lessons I can sum up with eight simple rules.
Moving to a dormitory is at its mildest arduous experience and, at its worst, shocking.
It's easy to start talking about it: you tell everyone what you are, what you liked, what you liked about Corbyn, and why you don't really hate or love Marmite, because it's just yeast extract, hahhaha, I'm in my room.
Take a breath sometimes.
And help others breathe: show your interest and ask others questions.
Asking questions will guide the conversation and help you find people you like and people you wouldn't talk to even when your freckles were on fire and these people would share fire extinguishers.
Give the others some space.
Our own rooms often serve as drinking counters, cinemas and public lounges, but your own room is also a place to dress, starting with underwear.
More about the topic: Don't even think about connecting dating and university studies
For Introverts, university is a tough place
A room of your own should be a calming place, but many dormitories have a social culture of walking from room to room and forming lifelong friendships.
Such a culture can be a nightmare for a person who needs a place to return.
It is not possible to say in this environment: "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to get out so I can recharge the energy I used to date you."
Try to see if one of your fellow students is exhausted from social interaction, perhaps you should not knock on the door and instead send a text.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
There was a guy in my student residence who thought an unlocked door meant he was welcome in.
He saw a lot of things.
Make friends by baking.
You start your studies properly when baking is in, so if you bake brownies and knock on someone's door, you don't seem like a 50s, a bit weird: "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something small. Smile when I ask you about personalities."
Homemade delicacies are a great way to make new friends.
Your college friends are forced to talk to you, and thanks to a tasty surprise, they can have a positive picture of you.
This, of course, requires reasonable bakering skills from you.
If you serve unhappy lumps of flour, sugar and fat, others will probably pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Stealing food is also a common offense in student dormitories.
Of course, taking another chicken is stealing, but can someone else's milk can pour a drop into their tea?
Always check with the owner of the milk can.
You'll probably get a permit, even if the milk quotes the owner of the can.
I understand that it's annoying if someone steals something from you, but try to deal with it as adultly as possible - unlike my own college friend who slobbered detergent on his milk as a punishment for the milk thieves.
She's in jail now.
Don't make any noise when others try to sleep or study.
Not just because it's polite, but it's also worth remembering that every other person digs a hole...
In my own dormitory, a girl asked the occupant of the next room to adjust the music to a lower level, since it was three in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
The neighbor just increased the volume.
When the next room finally quieted down, she let the neighbor sleep for two hours, leaving the music in her room and locking the door for three hours.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move to the same dormitory?
And wouldn't it be weird if you first thought that your college partner was your future spouse, that you would start dating, break up, and have to see him every day and lose the right to meet your mutual friends to him?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, and if the studymate is not exactly the only one, try to control your desire.
If you notice in a hilarious moment that someone has forgotten their keys to a room where the door isn't locked, the limit between prank and bullying is more volatile than you might think.
A good joke is funny, but one you get over in a moment.
Hiding an object can be a valuable and fun lesson, but no one's room should be soiled with toothpaste and shampoo.
You can lock the door in the other room and drop the keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer, but don't put anyone's things on the ceiling with a blue sticker a couple more times.
A racist attack on a foreign student accommodation in Kitee - House planned as a reception centre was soiled in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack was carried out on the foreign students' accommodation in Kitee in North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, this is not a place to stay for underage asylum seekers, but a place to sleep for foreign students who have been in Finland longer, says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher at the Evankelinen folk high school in Kite.
The windows and walls of the folk high school accommodations were stained with racist signs, such as swastikas, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one of the accommodations, says the police of Eastern Finland.
According to Luukkainen, who is responsible for youth guarantee training at the folk high school, the building that was the target of vandalism had an estimated ten people at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and grown-up people are free to move, so some could have been elsewhere," Luukkainen says.
People from 12 different nationalities are staying at the folk high school.
They are students who have already been in Finland for some time, as well as newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
Everyone in the mess-up building has a status.
Some are studying in adult comprehensive school, some are in vocational studies, and some are studying Finnish," Luukkainen says.
A status is a so-called continuous residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has already been in Finland for some time.
The police in Eastern Finland are investigating the attack as an act of damage and a violation of home peace.
According to Luukkainen, there was a press conference for students on Monday, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There is no panic here, and no one has wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for over a decade, and this is the first time something like this has happened," Luukkainen says.
According to Luukkainen, the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
At least three men were suspected to have been involved and they had been travelling on a light car.
I think this is the whim of the youth's weekend night, when this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious than that," Luukkainen says.
In Salo, too, a hospital has been soiled, where a reception centre has been planned.
The incident happened last week.
MTV told about the matter on its website on Tuesday evening.
A swastika was drawn on the hospital wall and written in English "You are not welcome."
A police report has been filed.
Revision 15.9. at 4.02 p.m. Corrected incorrect information provided by the police about the age and status of the people living in the building.
The state is shutting down the Y train to Karjaa - the passengers are upset, "unintelligently idiotic"
The Y train from Helsinki to Raasepori Karjaa will stop running in March.
The news was indignant at the passengers on the beginning of the train at Helsinki main railway station.
Especially the downfall strikes the Siuntio people, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It's idiotic, because the population is growing and those who work need a fast and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This cannot depend on anything but political will - or lack of it.
Bengtström says on HSTV's interview video he's going to come to the capital with a tractor.
There are also train changes elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H- and R-trains running on the main track will be connected to the new R-line.
Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula will be disabled.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on which routes the Ministry will purchase train traffic during the next contract period.
The contract period will change at the turn of the year and there will be routes to be closed throughout the country.
The new four-year contract to be finalised in the autumn will later be approved by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Siuntiolainen Bengtström considers the state's train cutter to be short-sighted.
We make the same mistakes that have been made in the past and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then there will be regret.
The Y-train is also used by others other than the Raseporians and the Siuntians, because it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Annina Pöyry, from Espoo, was upset about the fate of those travelling farther away from the city area by train.
"It's especially bad for those who have to redeploy their journey," he said as he struggled with the Y train.
A little relief is coming.
There will probably be a new train connection to the beach, which will replace the Y train in the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL), i.e. take it all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This will increase the costs for HSL, i.e. practically the municipalities and their taxpayers in the region.
"We are now beginning to explore different options and their impact on the service level and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, HSL's CEO.
It is still impossible to estimate the costs accurately.
Rihtniemi says that, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about a million dollars a year for the Y train, the ministry certainly far more than that.
The R line on the main track misses two stations.
Instead, the number of trains will double in Ainola and Saunakallio.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease from the whole country.
The Ministry no longer buys train traffic on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Säinäjoki.
Pieksämäki-Joensuu route will be shortened to Pieksämäki-Parkus.
The train services will be reduced on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka harbour and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million journeys a year are made on stopping shifts, while the total number of journeys purchased by the Ministry is about nine million.
The new contract is supposed to bring the state savings of 12.3 million a year.
The value of the contract is about 27.5 million euros a year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in Capital's topicality book: "Marx is worth studying"
The crises in the global economy have brought up Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his lead in Capital, published in 1867-1894, writes Yrjö Hakanen, known as the former Chairman of the SKP, in his book Marx's Capital's topicality today.
"He is now taken more seriously than in a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx's estimates of the development of the capitalist economy, internationalisation and penetration into all walks of life, the concentration of capital, and the growing role of financial capital and imaginary capital have proved amazingly farsighted.
The author list of the book based on the capital seminars organised by Hakase also includes a professor at Aalto University, the respected economic expert Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes Marx is topical "now and forever."
However, the former Chief Executive Officer of the Finnish Institute of Economics and the business delegation is not Marxist?
No, no, no, no.
Korkman says on the phone he doesn't think Marx is a topical economic thinker, but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, social sciences are differentiated and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary expert.
"The usual idea is that the history of the idea tells about the wrong opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
It is true that Marx's predictions went badly wrong.
Even though Marx understood the nature and meaning of the industrial revolution, he drew too far conclusions from the beginning of capitalism, Korkman ponders.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"The most relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he said.
Now we are talking again about Marx's interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may be able to give inspiration to anyone who wants to understand the big picture, the world that is changing as a result of a technical upheaval," Korkman analyses.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is not going to help.
After all, she said capitalism was a hopeless case that should just be stopped.
Still, Korkman thinks it's a good idea to study Marx.
"In the 70s, Marx could not be read," Korkman said.
"Maoists and Trotskyians and other sects all hated capitalism, but even more each other."
Today, the discussion is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political baggage of the past years.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's mindset - like other classics," Korkman says.
UN demands war criminals to be sentenced in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes committed in Sri Lanka's civil war, reports AFP.
The UN report on the civil war in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long postponement.
The report blames both the Sri Lankan armed forces for war crimes and the Tamil Tigers.
It is estimated that at least 100,000 people died in the Sri Lanka Civil War.
There is no precise information about the number of victims either.
Especially in the last months of the long war, the military's major attack in 2009 should be properly investigated, the UN report demands.
The report accuses Sri Lanka's armed forces of torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, the victims of which were as likely to be men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have been guilty of forcing bystanders and children to fight.
Both parties have committed murders, according to the report.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intends to organise the investigation itself, but does not intend to allow a UN court to be set up because foreign judges.
The English Yo experiment allowed you to weigh social media
On Wednesday, the student papers in the autumn had a long foreign language, most of which had English.
England's skills were tested by over 16,000 pledges.
In the experiment, you could write a paper about social media, for example.
Based on our own experiences, we had to wonder whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the writing of 150-250 words in English could be addressed to the director of the online magazine's advice column.
The headline was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is equivalent to the Finnish Leelia rest chair.
He asked for advice on how to get parents to look at things also for young people.
The total number of subjects was four, one of which had to be selected.
"It was the hardest of them," said Mia Lybeck, English lecturer at Porvoo's Swedish-speaking high school.
The third topic was just a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth topic was nice, according to Lybeck.
It had to write a fire speech to explain why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school, we've been practicing writing speeches," Lybeck says and estimates the whole experiment to be "unlikely."
In English - or Swedish - the English experiment allowed questions about texts that included adaptation of summer flounder to climate change and handling large data masses.
Some long Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written on Wednesday.
The autumn's articles will continue on Friday, when another Finnish or Finnish experiment will take place.
In upper secondary schools, the test is organised normally, meaning that the employees' demonstration does not affect it.
The matriculation examination board advises the candidates to find suitable transport connections in time to get to the trial.
You can also get extra time if you can prove that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
A shop was robbed in Oulu at gunpoint
A shop in the Kello district was robbed in Oulu on Wednesday morning.
According to the police, the robber was wearing dark clothes and a commando hat covering his face.
The man is normal and about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and caught a small amount of money.
The case is being investigated as a aggravated robbery.
Police prepare for tens of thousands of protesters arriving in Helsinki - support patrols from elsewhere in Finland
The protest against the government's cutting decisions will block the centre of Helsinki on Friday, the police predict.
According to preliminary information, as many as tens of thousands of people can arrive.
Members of SAK, Akava and STTK federations will meet at the Railway Square at 11 a.m.
Police officers are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
The task of the police at work is not only to carry out the alert tasks and other police operations, but also to ensure that the giant demonstration goes smoothly.
Roads leading to the railway market will be closed from motor vehicles between about 9.30 and 14 p.m.
Only emergency vehicles will be allowed in the area.
From Hakaniemi's direction, traffic will be cut off at Kaisaniemi's roundabout, from the west direction starting from Mannerheimintie.
Are there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Chief Inspector Seppo Kujala?
At least for the time being, it looks like it's enough.
I don't take a stand about the police's industrial battle issues.
According to Kujala, there are support patrols coming to Helsinki from elsewhere in Finland because of the demonstration.
The police won't tell you the exact patrol numbers.
"Some things are coming, but as a rule we can manage on our own," Kujala says.
Police advise to avoid private driving in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic sum extends from Hakaniemi level to its core centre.
Standing traffic is expected from the early evening of the morning.
With protesters from other parts of Finland, a lot of charter buses are also coming to Helsinki.
They will not be allowed to the Railway Square.
In principle, the buses remain quite distant.
The rest of the journey then needs to be walked to the demonstration place," Kujala says.
The demonstration also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From the police's point of view, there is also a positive side to this.
The issue of the flow of public transport, which is normally at hand at these big people's gatherings, is now partly taken care of itself.
The protesters have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of government economic policy may come to Helsinki.
The police expect the demonstration to go peacefully.
After all, people are ordinary working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
After all, Finns are sensible and calm people," Kujala says.
There will also be local demonstrations in different parts of Finland on Friday.
Friday's demonstration is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is not a very good benchmark for it in Finnish political history, says Emeritus Siisiäinen, professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It is no wonder that the Ay movement protests.
If it didn't, it would raise your hands in front of the government, says Siisiäinen.
A very right-wing government has struck at the cores of Finnish corporatism tradition - and also at points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's tough grips are interfering with contract law.
There are a lot of features of trying to get the AY movement to its knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
The mirror is needed, for example, because the agency does not have the support of all employees for Friday's demonstrations.
What is new now is the sharp division that the demonstration will bring about among the members of the Ay movement who would like to take part in the demonstration.
The unemployed gathered from all over Finland protested at the Parliamentary House in November 1993.
If you're looking for a point of comparison for Friday's demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, called Murrostorstai, organized in 1993, says Siisiäinen.
In the middle of the deepest recession, Murrostorstai brought together 20,000 unemployed.
Esko Aho's (central) government stumbled from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relationship between the Finnish government and employee organisations had never before been as bad as that of Aho's bourgeois government.
Now the relationship between the government and the Ay movement may be even worse than in the time of Murrostorsta.
In addition, Finland's most bourgeois government is now in power, Siisiäinen says.
The current coalition of government is still interesting in such a way that it is so strict on the right, despite what the Finns said.
There were still certain elements of the old labour movement at the time.
Several thousand protesters are expected on Friday.
The demonstration also stops public transport and possibly closes kindergartens and schools.
Even though the demonstration does not receive undivided support from employees, it can become the biggest in years.
In recent years, about 300 demonstrations have been organised in Helsinki annually.
They're from side to side.
Traditionally, Finnish protests by the Ay movement have been quite calm - even though the policies have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, Finnish protest avoids conflict, we are law-abiding.
The protestors try to avoid damaging or destroying property, says Siisiäinen.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The demonstration culture changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and the police prepared to get pig shit on themselves.
The firefighters strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also spectacular strikes among pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electric strikes in the 1970s
The most significant strikes in the 1970s were a metal strike in 1971 and a power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
70,000 metal men took part in the metal men's strike.
The strike was suspended with a proposal from the settlement board after seven weeks of the strike.
Metalmen received a 16 percent raise.
The spring 1977 electricity strike lasted 49 days and caused power cuts across the country.
Breaking Thursday, 1993
On November 4, 1993, some 20,000 people gathered in front of the Parliamentary House, many of whom have been made unemployed by the recession, to protest in favour of the work.
Firefighters striked for three months in 1998
The firemen's strike was one of the longest, if not longest, national strike in the 1990s.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were caught in egg rain when farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
"Siperia teaches, the EU stops," one of the slogans was one.
For Espa, farmers dumped tons of snow.
The Helsinki EU summit in 1999 also caused farmers to protest and burn bales in front of the meeting place.
Nurses striked in 1983 and 1995
Nurses were on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been on strike was 1983.
The strike in 1995 was colored by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened strike and nurses' collective resignations in 2007.
The threat of mass resignation eventually speeded the negotiations to a conclusion.
Doctors Striked 2001
"Doctors on strike - forced to," was the slogan of doctors on strike in 2001.
The strike by municipal health centre and hospital doctors lasted about five months and sparked a lively discussion about how strikes could endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised doctors' wages.
Students on the move in 2013
About 5,000 students marched in favour of student support in Helsinki from Senate Square to Parliamentary House in 2013.
Central Crime Police investigates backgrounds of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police for help in investigating the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped a truck with 42 refugees near the German border in Aisterheim.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
Those on board the cold truck were all in good condition.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and the main responsibility lies at the scene in Austria, according to Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the Central Crime Police.
At the end of August, other refugees on board in Austria were more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board apparently died by suffocation.
According to Yleinenradio, who first reported cooperation with Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited company.
The company carries out restaurant activities, for example, and its CEO is a man of foreign background, about 40 years old.
In Austria, two Iraqi men have been arrested for smuggling human beings.
A captain beating refugees, a former drug courier and a rich businessman - the story of five smugglers
A loaded king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a stylistic missionary, and a taxi driver who thinks he's a good guy.
For example, these people are smuggling people into the European Union.
The criminologist Andrea Di Nicola, who works at Trento University, and the journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and the book Death Travel Agency, which they wrote, is published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the tentacles of human smuggling, propose solutions and present smugglers from different steps of the business.
HS presents five of them.
I'm going to beat the hell out of them right now.
Kerkenna Islands on the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians are heading there for the summer.
In terms of its location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, as the journey to the island of Lampedusa, which belongs to Italy, is only 120 kilometres away.
For comparison: distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometres.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, the chain-burning captain and the father of six children.
Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimps, but it is more profitable for a fisherman to transport people.
That's what Emir has already done with his blue, ten-metre wooden boat hundreds of times.
If the boat is full, it can accommodate 40 people.
For one trip, Emir earns about 8,000 euros after expenses.
Emir has five assistants who are looking for customers around Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis sparked again.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will accommodate them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is given in such a way that customers barely survive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer runs out of money, that's their problem.
We're going to take off at midnight and put out a lantern.
The first night is driven away from the islands, then stopped, wait for the day and drive the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and in waves 20 metres high, passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir is on his way back.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats his customers and at least claims to beat the troublemakers to death.
He says in the book that once the police caught him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed customers one by one from the neck and threw them overboard," Emir said in the book.
The calmest passengers come from the south side of the Sahara.
He said he had to abuse his countrymen from here.
I'm going to beat the hell out of them right now.
We need to show them who's in charge here immediately.
Just an ordinary taxi driver
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.
His taxi is not very good - the starter engine is running out and it has already seen its best days.
The most important thing for Goran's customers, however, is that the taxi moves at all, and that it moves towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 people about 60 kilometres southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where families are mainly allowed.
In the woods around the centre, men who travel without their family stay in tents, lavatorys and abandoned cars, which is what anyone has managed to find or build.
Families who, for one reason or another, have not filed an asylum application for Serbia also live in the forest.
Some also stay in private apartments, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of border crossings and weeks of walking in difficult terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When people finally arrive at the Bogovaða area, the great hub of human smuggling, they are dying tired.
Goran's riders are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The Syrians are the best customers, he says in the book.
"They say it once, and that's enough," Goran says.
He said the Africans are trying to bargain.
Goran won't like that.
Silly nonsense all the way.
For example, a price of 300 euros will be agreed first, then they will lower it to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran emphasises that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I don't care about the money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran says he's working cheaper than the others and charging only 50 euros per person for a ride to the Hungarian border.
The distance is about 300 kilometres, most of the motorway comfortably.
They say colleagues ask for a triple or quadruple price.
Goran earns about 50,000 euros a year.
It's not a big sum for a smuggler, but it's a pretty nice annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has decreed that taxis are not allowed to transport migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care about it: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his rider a mile from the border.
Then she points the right direction to her customers and screams away.
The Work of Mercy
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called a Missionary, and that's not just a nickname.
He does indeed have a Protestant church in Kampala, Uganda's capital, where there are many believers who have fled Congo, and a small centre to help Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Missionary runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He sees himself doing the work of mercy.
It is important for the missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and makes sure the rubber band of white underpants looks elegantly under the low waistline of jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his SUV and his three motorcycles.
When the Missionary does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and forwards to Europe.
The customer will first call one of the Missionary's five telephone numbers.
He advises that it is worth arriving at the border in the morning, hiding the money carefully, and slid in among the cross-border peddlers.
To get an asylum seeker or refugee status, Ugandan authorities should be told that they come from war areas such as North Kivu, and that they have had to flee from their home for violence.
Often it is true, but if it isn't, the Missionary organises a new identity for the customer.
The old ID will be destroyed and a replacement will be purchased.
The Missionary contacts with Ugandan police will help.
After that, the customer will be directed to the same place where even the right asylum seekers will go: asylum procedure, to NGOs, eventually to the UN refugee organisation UNHCR.
The missionary knows bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He charges for each step separately: leaving an application to Ugandan police costs about €100, handling documents to a humanitarian organisation about 150, and moving to a European country for example €4 500-7,000.
Folio and ice cubes
Tom is a rookie smuggler, a former drug courier.
An Irishman in his 40s is on duty on the French coast of Calais, where his job is to load people to lorries en route to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan, a French taxi driver living in London, and dozens of truck drivers who do not necessarily even know they are in the human smuggling business.
At night Tom and the taxi driver picked up their customers, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near Calais centre.
They're driving the A26 and they're trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the motorway, Tom and the driver would go straight to jail for organising illegal immigration.
Tom doesn't want that, he's been doing seven years for drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom and his customers run across the motorway to a rest stop where the drivers sleep before continuing across the Channel to the Brits.
Tom chooses a suitable truck - to make sure it is on its way to England and not to Holland, for example - and cuts through the safety cable of the cover.
It has to be done quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his customers in aluminium foil, the same kind that is wrapped around a roast or baked potato in the kitchen.
That should keep the police heat scanner from noticing who's hiding.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his customers in a truck and leaves, hoping the driver doesn't rush stowaways, at least not before Britain.
King of Smugglers
Muammer Kedk is one of the world's most famous human smugglers.
The up-and-coming Turk has been called the champion of marketing and the indisputable king of illegal Mediterranean landings, who controls the sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Since the 1990s, K.q. has been working and has been constantly developing new methods of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only demands the money when he gets there.
One of the new methods is a luxury ship scam: yachts from Turkish ports are supposed to be chartered to take American or European families to a nice tourist cruise for a few days.
In reality, the ships are being loaded to the full by Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are first transported from Istanbul to a port and then to Europe by sea for a fee of 5 000 to 7,000 euros.
Customers are kept in human storage, for example in old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People are crammed into minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among the vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it is given, you must board the ship quickly.
Passengers must stay hidden all the way under the deck.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, as there are no other signs of a crowd.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
After the cost of one luxury ship trip, K.q. will receive about 53,000 euros.
He doesn't do practical things himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, housekeepers and other smaller people to do the work for him.
At least hundreds of transports are organised during the summer season, and K
He is believed to have bought land through cover companies, a pharmaceutical company and more than a hundred apartments he rents.
Muammer Kedk was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a member of the Democratic Party of Turkey and an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical sector.
Since then, he seems to have disappeared.
Correction 16.9.2015 at 15.10 a.m.: The Death Travel Agency book will be published this week, not next week.
American Olympic runner tells about his illness and becoming a prostitute in his book
The new book by 1,500 metres runner Suzy Favor Hamilton, which competed three times in the Olympics, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book Fast Girl, tells of his career ending and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated published sections of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton ended his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the games in top shape and ran in the qualifiers for the second best time.
But in the final, he panicked.
From the very beginning, he rushed to the top and defended his lead with a manic run.
However, 150 metres before the goal, his strength was exhausted.
He collapsed on the track, and the other rivals passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot and thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself over the finish line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
Later it was revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt tremendous pressure for success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of getting paid to have sex with strange men.
She also convinced her husband to accept her actions.
Favor Hamilton's rate was 450 euros an hour.
He says he spent the money on luxury life.
Favor Hamilton's explanation for becoming a prostitute was also that he needed the same kind of adrenaline spikes he had when competing in athletics.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he had bipolar disorder.
The former star runner's double life was revealed at the end of 2012, when the Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was 3,57,40, the world's top statistical number one at 1500 metres, but was the last in the Sydney Olympic final.
The world champion rejoiced when the union disciplined Norway's ski rooster: "Straightback"
The Norwegian ski king, Petter Northug, has crossed the limits of propriety in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian ski association have twisted the athlete's contract for the whole summer and autumn, like last year.
Even though the union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been enough for a multiple world champion and Olympic champion.
The Norwegian ski association decided to exclude Northug from the World Cup of the coming season.
The decision was praised by the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad the union controlled the ski rooster.
"Thank you for pointing to the spine," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the union sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian ski association and Northug is about money.
Northug apparently would like to be part of the season's national team so he can advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent the union, which also cares for future generations, and does not let one athlete play solo.
At the same time, he recalled that the union has given Northug both financial and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has quite different rules than just because he is the best.
On Tuesday, Northug published his own press release in which he said he wanted to play in Norwegian colours next season in the World Cup and then in the World Championships and Olympic Games.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six World Championship medals in her career, including two gold medals.
He was part of a team that won message gold in Falun last winter.
Roast translators' shield day is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On S.H.I.E.L.D. on September 25th, there will be stunts in various restaurants and shops that have been granted the Roast Translators' shield.
The goal of the day is to highlight Finland's high-quality food industry skills and lower the threshold for going to a restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of the high quality.
At the same time, we want to remind you that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the capital region, but top restaurants inspected and classified by an impartial operator are found all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of increasing the familiarity of the turtle restaurants and the organisation.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is organised in Vaasa in restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola, a restaurant in Old Town will take part in the shield day.
The event has also received significant international attention.
The decision has been made to make the event one of the most significant international events that will take place in the same day around the world.
Finland will continue to host the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: From the establishment of the Kauhava reception centre to the Attorney General
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to set up a refugee reception centre in Kauhava's ex-opportunity now owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, there is still a permanent crisis-time critical infrastructure in the area that is used by the armed forces and its partner, Suomen Erillisverkkot Oy.
Kauhajoki magazine reports that according to a private individual, investing a reception centre in the same building would pose a significant security risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the military may have interests in the area and the airport of the former Air War School, the effect of which has not also been clarified during the preparation of the reception centre, the newspaper writes.
The case states that there have been discussions over Kauhava airport over the last two years about the organisation of flight training and the arrival of a potential foreign operator at the airport.
The matter has been discussed, among other things, with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (P.D.) and Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Defence Arto Rädy.
A private person says to the Attorney General that the complaint is not a matter of objecting in principle to the reception centre, but that the planned place in the former garrison area is wrong.
Kauhava City Board discussed the reception centre issue last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The management means that the immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö commented to the reporters in the evening after meeting the chairmen of all the parliamentary parties at his official residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the president, the concern about managing the refugee situation brought all the participants together.
He considers it valuable that in Finland government and opposition parties are able to discuss the fundamental issues in confidence.
Especially in these times when we face major challenges
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and the actions of Russia and the United States in the region can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, as a result, the Baltic Sea region.
Niinistö is hopeful about the development of the dialogue.
If that situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia are able, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the further tension in the Baltic Sea situation.
According to Niinistö, the question of NATO was also addressed in discussions.
The president did not comment on the labour market situation.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, Alkot closed for a couple of hours
One flight will be cancelled already on Thursday and 15 Friday.
The list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair's website.
Finavia says that the operations at the airports will be carried out by the superiors during the stoppage.
However, congestion and delays are expected for security checks and other service points.
The demonstration closes the streets of central Helsinki
The demonstration will close the streets in central Helsinki on Friday.
Police say the streets leading to Railway Square will be closed from the cars around 9.30-14.
From Mannerheimintie direction, no cars are allowed to Kaivokatu, Postikatu or Töölönlahtinkatu towards the railway station.
From Union Street to Hakaniemi, traffic is directed to Union Street at Kaisaniemi's roundabout.
According to the police, the closing time depends on the population involved in the demonstration.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
Metro and tram drivers at the rally all Friday
Metro and tram drivers take part in Friday's demonstration from the beginning of morning traffic to the end of night traffic.
The association of tram and metro staff told the STT about the matter last night.
The majority of starters close for two hours, including mail closed
The demonstration on Friday will also cause disruption to Posti services.
Significant delays can be expected, for example, for the delivery of day mail.
Most of the postal service points are closed.
The blood transports of the Finnish Red Cross are carried out despite the strike.
Food transport and hospital deliveries and laboratory samples are also being taken care of.
Information about the services can be found on Posti's website.
Most of Finland's Alkko closes their doors for two hours on Friday.
Service trade union Pam has instructed her employees to stop work between 11 and 13.
Pam has also urged grocery trade employees to take part in the trade union demonstration.
SOK and Kesko's representatives will tell Helsingin Sanomat that the store will be kept open with superior powers if necessary.
According to Kesko, there is no information yet on the possible closure of individual shops.
Helsinki day care centres partially closed
The day care centres in Helsinki do not work to their full extent on Friday, says the Helsinki National Agency for Early Education.
Because of the trade union demonstration, day care is possibly concentrated in certain day care centres, and club activities in kindergartens and playgrounds are not organised.
24-hour day care centres and groups of mentally disabled and multi-disabled children remain open.
In addition, the afternoon activities of mentally disabled and autistic schoolchildren are organised normally.
The Early Education Agency promises to inform more about changes in operations tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, there is a need for diverse channels for communication, and the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches are one of the others.
This kind of direct speech channel will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä said to journalists in the parliament.
Sipilä didn't want to estimate how often the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches will be repeated.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be delivered on Yle channels in the future.
If other channels register as a channel, let's see.
Now we use this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires a television and radio speech to be given to citizens.
This whole thing we are talking about is quite complicated and requires a longer justification.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä explained.
The speech will be broadcast from 21.05 to 21.20 both on TV1 and Radio in Finland.
It can also be watched in Yle Areena.
Sipilä takes a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä's televised speech will not tell of a more general introvert of the government.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define a public debate more strictly into its own hands and to refuse a public discussion about the questions?
Reminds me of a recent statement by Minister of Foreign Affairs (Timo) Soin that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these things are not related.
Koivunen understands that commercial media is indignant about Sipilä's announcement.
It would be weird if the media field didn't react.
Political decision-makers' communication styles are not announcements in democracy.
The role of media representatives is, by definition, to try not to take politicians' agendas when given.
According to Koivusen, television speech is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table to meet the exceptionally high expectations of the speech.
Is there more of what we have already heard available today?
Or is he able to speak in a different tone, in a different way or in different words or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old, you have to wonder why such a big gesture was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
Yle also takes a risk in that sense, if it is not a special situation, but a routine speech among others.
There is a danger that Yle will be branded as a communicator of politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in Yle's interest or general policy.
Sipilä's clever move
In Sipilä's forthcoming speech, what the Prime Minister does not say is also important, the media researcher emphasises.
In the evening, we should take a close look at what Sipilä is missing and what it is not, says Heikki Kuutti, research coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to Kuutti, TV speech is a clever move from Sipilä, because it allows him to bring out his own vision without turning to gravel.
This way the message will be given a public audience without a journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
Sipilä bypasses the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a danger that the media will interpret something wrong from the speech, because it will not be possible to ask more specific questions.
According to the moon, it's very important how Sipilä performs on TV - whether the sweat is falling, the hands are shaking.
He compares Sipilä to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can put it well, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government were to inform something, because here a person is talking directly to another person.
This is what Obama and his partners do regularly (US President Barack).
Very exceptional
Political researcher Erkka Railo thinks the Prime Minister's speech to the citizens is truly exceptional.
According to him, it has not happened in decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, says Railo.
The researcher thinks the Prime Minister wants to make the Finns sympathise with the blackmails ahead.
On Friday, wage-earners' organisations will organise demonstrations and strikes against the government's actions.
Paavo Arhinmäki, president of the Left Alliance, said on Twitter that Sipilä could give a speech about the state of the nation in parliament as a Prime Minister's announcement, so that the speech could also be discussed.
SDP President Antti Rinne (Sd.) announces that he is challenging Sipilä's dialogue.
This is no time for monologues.
Soon six months after the election.
You can't hide forever, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on the run has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine when he was found.
The boy has been found and in the KING, the boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The Police Department of Inner Finland also confirms the matter to Iltalehti.
The boy went out to play around four o'clock in the afternoon.
Later in the evening, he was no longer in contact.
My father thanks all the people who helped in the search.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed in the violent fad of young people: You create anger
Makwan Amirkhani, a Kurdish fighter, released a video on Facebook, which specifically appeals to young people with an immigrant background.
Makwan Amirkhani gave a heavy speech against street fights among young people.
Amirkhani, who was born in Iran and arrived in Finland with his family at the age of five, has so far won both of his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series in the free match.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking him to look at an Instagram account.
Videos have been downloaded to the account, in which young people fight with extreme violence.
Amirkhani says he's disappointed in the young people's fad.
Amirkhan, 26 years old, has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys are kicking the people on the ground, sitting on top of the other person, and striking without thinking about any of these consequences, what will happen when you do these kinds of videos, Amirkhani updates.
Hard to defend anymore
Some of the young people seen in the videos have an immigrant background.
According to Chief Inspector Jarmo Heinonen of the Helsinki Police, both immigrants and young people from Finland have downloaded fight videos to social media.
It's the fact that you're fighting at the top of the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, Amirkhani from Turku reminds.
Amirkhani reminds that there are websites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
There have been a gross number of these isolated cases.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you any longer.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be guests here for quite a long time.
That's a slightly different way to thank you for being here, Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani encourages young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever fall victim to racism, you will blame yourself for it.
Think about it a couple of times before you go along with something like that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action is a contribution to racism.
You make me hate that I don't like either.
You're already having a bad time and you won't make it any better, Amirkhani decides.
SAK pledges its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
SAK president Lauri Lyly says on Twitter that the employee association will consider its position on the alternative savings list presented by STTK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK's proposal on Twitter.
Earlier Wednesday, STTK announced that it would present its own proposal to the government to achieve the five per cent productivity leap demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre).
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder believes the board will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require SAK, the largest employee organisation, to soften its previous position.
SAK president Lauri Lyly, for his part, commented on the matter in a narrowly worded way on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock", and that instead of forced laws, agreements are needed by active parties.
Lyly points out that Prime Minister Sipilä's government's proposal for a social contract was not acceptable to SAK.
Sipilä earlier interrupted negotiations on a social contract when SAK refused to commit to the goal of a five per cent productivity leap.
Comment: The grand demonstration threatens to fade - "It feels a bit funny to thrash your fist"
It's a bit funny to shake your fist if you already have a settlement paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The atmosphere varies from side to side in an employee camp.
Is it supposed to shout the government down, or is it supposed to agree with it?
On Monday, SAK's union leaders breathed holy hatred against the republic's government.
The whole of Finland was threatened with closing.
The threat spread to the Akavans as well.
The teachers' union OAJ threatened to close schools and nurseries.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: no school or kindergarten will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), chairman of the staff centre organisation STTK, performed conciliatoryly.
He said he had kept in touch with the government and prepared an alternative proposal called for by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre) as a five per cent productivity leap.
Akava's chairman, Sture Fjäder (kok) immediately rushed to announce that his settlement papers have already been completed.
At first, there was no sound from SAK's office.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is hard to agree when the union leaders just Monday told the country to stand up on Friday.
Finally, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau will meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK will look for solutions to "open the labour market lock."
In order to create a collective wage and salary earners' proposal, SAK should be inclined to accept a five per cent productivity leap as a goal.
It is no wonder that Palola's STTK has a good relationship with Sipilä's government.
Palola's right-hand man, Jukka Ilmaus, director of STTK's social engagement, previously served as a special assistant to the central prime ministers Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
In fact, Palola described the government's ay-know-how as being improved all the time.
It's a coincidence or not, but Palola's exit took a bit of a boost away from Finland's stoppers, whose vantage point is African Marko Pieinen (sd).
It's a bit funny to put a fist in your pocket if you already have a make-up paper in your pocket.
Edited at 6 pm: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
Russian Duma President Sergei Naryshkin criticised the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
Russian Duma Speaker Sergei Naryshkin thinks Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
A autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun in Ulan Bator, Mongolia's capital, where Naryshkin made extensive comments about the Helsinki formal meeting in July.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who were forced to force the European Union to come to a meeting - a matter the President was able to remind journalists of.
According to our estimates, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed according to the news agency Interfax.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU but also at the United States, where he had also been blocked.
Sanctions are a political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation was uncomplicated, so Naryshkin continued to pry Finland with praise and praise for Mongolia's "excellent organisation."
I am sure that the parliamentary assembly will be constructive and with positive results - unlike the meeting that took place in Helsinki in July.
Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue should not be hindered.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (cok) who, according to Russian media, has already talked to the Russian delegation in Ula Bator.
The Clave meets the real playoff troll: "The paints are tight"
Tappara and Lukko will continue in Hakametsä today as both are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that today there will be no actual goal party in Hakametsä.
Tappara went to Kuopio yesterday to drill a 3-2 spin from KalPa.
The rise was manly, as last season's silver team was worst of a two-goal losing position.
The lock's Tuesday was a lot better.
The Blues, who started the Rauman catch with a tangled start, had round zero points, and the loss figures were also 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if any play the same game as last year, Luku attacker Janne Lahti anticipates layouts on the club's website.
Tappara has become quite a playoff nightmare for the people of Rauma.
Tappara has dropped the final series of the Luko in the semifinals in the previous two seasons.
Both times a decisive seventh match has been required for the solution.
Last season, Lukko took the series to a break already in the fourth game, but Tappara rose in the next three by the side and past.
With the exception of goalies, there are no major changes in group formations.
The cashiers who rejected both of them yesterday will have a flute today.
With Tapara's goal, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Bear, and Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski between the Lukko poles.
Viewpoint: A miserable play is going on in Ässä
The sports director Toivola wrote an unsuitable sequel to the head coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote Rocky, in which he himself played the lead.
The underdog sensationally struggled with the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a lot of sympathy, even though he finally lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's premiere, Mika Toivola wrote a restless Cinderella story in Pori.
Unnamed and wooden-handed casserole went to everyone's amazement at the SM finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but persistent underdogs like Rocky.
There were White Indians, Pori Matt and Pele Pelto.
In the playoffs, the players dyed their heads red and cut the Irokees.
Toivola became blonde.
Great TV commentator JP Jalo called the coach Neumann.
Aces took the won silver.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
The screenwriter Toivola believes that this season's new work will work in the same way as it did ten years ago.
The man who works as a sports director for the Ässä has built a casserole on bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been pounding the guys in the rink like Rocky pig carcasses at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen's merits lie in something other than playing in the disc.
Toivola has forgotten that Pekka Rautakallio plays the main part in Rocky VI.
Karri Kivi has crucified Rautakallio with Sean Connery.
Rautakallio is as clumsy a lead performer as Connery would have been in the original 1976 work in Toivola's script.
There's nothing else in Iron Rock but a nickname.
Rautakallio's game philosophy does not include rushing and little pigs.
He appreciates the tough game, but it's one thing to play hard than a pig.
Last season, Ässien Garret Stafford hit Tapara Jere Karjalainen on the head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Rautakallio put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only have those who deserve to play.
I don't approve of that kind of game and it's not part of the ace hockey, the hot Rautakallio squealed to the Satakunta People after the game.
The Ässien team for this season is strangely built.
There are juniors, veterans, police officers and bulldozers.
There are practically no key men of the best age.
No wonder the head coach has complained of a skill shortage.
How much have you been able to influence player acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
Last season's events have an impact on procurement and, unfortunately, the situation on the market was rather limited, Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
It's smouldering under the surface.
The 1953 model, Rautakallio, is known to be interested in moving to Toivola as a sports boss.
The men's contracts end in the spring.
The Ässit balance in the three league games of the season is as many losses with goal difference 1-6.
Toivola should not have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuukka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under her husband's direction.
Yes, in the film I play the mother of my husband's friend.
In a way it feels crazy, the actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
She has been married to Apulanta's ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temonen since 2008.
The couple has done a lot of work together before, but now Olga is acting under Tuukka's direction for the first time.
Olga's role in Apulanta's film "You Made Us Beautiful" is drummer Sipe Santapuk's mother Sirkka.
Sirkka tsempa and supports his son, even though his father Risto (presented by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I have become familiar with my true role model, Sirka, the easier it seems to be to play the role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuukka for trusting me with the role.
Olga had already met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have come much closer.
They've met, talked on the phone, and they've been texting.
Sirkka has helped so much.
We've been going through a lot of their history from different angles.
Sirkka is also fortunate to understand that drama is drama and the truth may need to be slightly coloured.
Olga emphasises that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanta would be Finland's biggest band.
In the '90s, there was a recession and it was really sad.
There was a rather small probability that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga says she had heard a lot about Tuukka's youth already before the film plans.
However, parents' stories have sometimes been slightly different.
Yes, if you are a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were doing.
Olga reveals that her youth was completely different from Tuukka's, known as Heinola's notorious skateboard story.
Olga was an everyday girl who had nothing to do with Tuukka in the film.
At most, he could have secretly fallen in love.
According to Olga, he has cooperated so much with Tuukka in the past 10 years that a big joint project does not scare him.
Everything has always gone super well.
Now the whole production group is going to shoot in Heinola for a month.
True, a couple living in Iitt are often planning to drive home for the sake of their young children, because the distance is not too long.
We're taking over the whole Heinola for a month.
They have welcomed us very warmly, just asking which streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive play in Finland
The budget for the film Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, is 17 million euros.
The shoot will begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola begins filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
The sequel of the Scifi film Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will be the most expensive drama ever made in Finland with a budget of 17 million euros.
Previously, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been on Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation that is under construction will also rise after completion of Iron Sky 2, with a budget of over 100 million euros.
The film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa, begins in October near Antwerp in AED Studios and lasts eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola leaves for Belgium already next week.
The giant budget doesn't scare me.
I've been so relaxed!
I feel so relaxed about the script, because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone in the task force seems to realise that something unprecedented is being done.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though the time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, she tells Iltalehti.
Originally, the budget for the film was set at 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
It's a big budget, but it's a big story, too.
But you could shove 100 million into the film, because every angle and effect is so expensive.
Now everything is so tight that there is no looseness.
The film production company Iron Sky Universe launched a crowdfunding campaign and a bond with an annual rate of between 4 and 8 per cent on Wednesday.
The final interest rate will be determined according to the demand and supply during the campaign.
In two years at the latest, the company will repay the loan.
The action film is played by Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov, among others.
Junk or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Lately, the fronts of the Trendsetters have been decorated with big logos.
A while ago, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
The advertising of a hoodie or a T-shirt sign was seen as a bit of a hick.
But times change.
Sporting has become the real megatrend of fashion, and so have old, familiar sport fashion brands like Adidas and Nike.
And as so often before, the line between funny and trendy is fluctuating: if something is already a real hillbilly, it begins to become ironic and cool.
First came a norm core trend, or mundane fashion, in which the trendsetters surprised by preferring the most boring basic clothes as a way to separate themselves from the mass.
Now, instead of the grey standard college, the sweat shirt that is already buried at the bottom of the cabinet, with the manufacturer's logo showing up in front of it, will be turned on.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, for example Adidas' recognizable stripes, favorite team jerseys and New York Yankees hats have made a return to street fashion.
The Calvin Klein logos of the underwear are now a cool detail from the beginning of the jeans edge.
The trend seems to be moving from sport brands to luxury brands.
For example, the front of Versace's autumn blouses makes it clear what the clothing is.
Would you be ready to display logos in your dress?
Russian politician released evidence: I didn't get stuck in the tank hatch for hours!
According to claims, a special incident would have happened in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015 was held to present Russian war industry products.
There have been colorful claims in the Russian media in recent days that the Russian emergency department had to remove Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything in his power to deny the information.
He even posted a picture on his own public Facebook page, where he seems to be peeking at the armored vehicle hatch in quite good moods and, at least, based on those photos, it's not a matter of getting stuck or angry.
It's a bunch of nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go inside the battle tank, but it was the assault tank BMP-3.
I am a former soldier myself, Lieutenant Colonel, I have served in the Urals.
I went inside, looked around, and came out in peace, Zotov said to Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I didn't get stuck and I certainly didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
Zotov explained that he admired Russia's new technology in the exhibition because he is a former professional soldier himself.
That's why I was interested in what was inside the carriage, I admired our technology.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And even in the next exhibition, I will definitely visit all the tanks and all the assault tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the reporter who wrote about it a fool.
One idiot wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went in, and I came out.
I'm tall, I'm slobbery, but nothing like me stuck in a tank somewhere, didn't happen, he said to Russkaya sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photograph of the alleged stuck has been published, even though the gun show had a total of 50,000 people in a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck began with a case on Bloknot.ru, where Zotov was told to struggle out of the tank door to try and finally threaten to shoot everyone around him if he did not get out of his grip.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up article in which the exhibition organisers shared their views on the event.
Everyone is just used to soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles quickly.
But MP Zotov, because of his big size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he certainly didn't sit there for five hours, said exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevsky to Bloknot.

There has been a leak in the Kittilän mine of Agnico Eagle Finland, a Canadian-owned mining company.
The gold mine's purified process water has been leaking from the so-called tailing pool into a ditch.
According to the company, measures to repair the leak have been initiated.
The pool has desiccated tailings and purified process water from the foaming process.
Usually the water is pumped either to be re-used as process water or to be passed to the environment via the surface draining field according to the permit.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was observed.
According to the company, the quality of leak water meets the current permit conditions.
There was no other material leaking into the environment.
The leak was observed during the inspection round on Monday morning.
The leak has not been found to cause structural damage to the dam structures in the pool.
The company says it is working closely with authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent employees.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish country report published today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) largely follows the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation pushed Finland into comprehensive structural reforms to deal with economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the whole contract system and unemployment benefit.
According to Danske Bank's chief economist Pasi Kuoppamäki, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
The IMF's assessment contains a lot of sympathetic messages for government actions, but on the other hand there are also warning words about what shouldn't be cut too much.
These include infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki says to Taloussanom.
In the IMF's view, growth projects should also be implemented as quickly as possible to support weak economic growth.
The IMF anticipates an economic growth rate of 0.4 per cent for Finland this year, which will accelerate to 0.9 per cent next year.
Danske, in his new business forecast today, expects the growth to be zero this year.
The IMF is a bit more optimistic about this year.
They may have had the basis for the latest observations.
This morning, Statistics Finland said that total output was growing slightly in the summer, Kuoppamäki says.
Less attention could be paid to the weakened industry's trust or other so-called softer indicators.
However, the differences are only a few percentage points.
Nintendo, who recovers from death, appointed a new leader
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will start working on Wednesday, Nintendo said on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002, and he was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for launching a successful Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as Iwata's potential followers.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata's footprints, estimates Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
Kimishima's task is to get Nintendo into mobile games, but not to eat the company's bread on the side of traditional consoles.
More and more underage asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
Already in February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service acknowledged that hundreds of children who have come to the country disappear every year.
For example, SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter have reported this on their website, according to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of minor applicants disappear every year in the country.
Senior Inspector-General of the Finnish Immigration Service Juha Kannelmaa says what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is it the same in Finland?
How many applicants disappear "under country" per year?- A total of 156 asylum applications were made in Finland in 2013.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014, similar applications were made in 196 and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelmaa says.
The reason for the disappearance may be that the case will reveal that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and has possibly been found to be of age there.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue to process the case in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for examining the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 were closed because the applicant had probably moved away from Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared in the last 123 years, he says.
Is the number increasing?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum for a minor who has been alone.
The overall statistics on minor asylum seekers who have disappeared this year are not yet available, but the number of underage applicants is known and has clearly increased, which is also likely to affect the number of missing persons, he emphasises.
What will happen to those who have decided to convert?
Do they also disappear, for example, into the "dark labour market"?
This is difficult to estimate from the Finnish Immigration Service, because the police are responsible for implementing the conversion decisions, Kannelmaa emphasises.
Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered candidates.
He has taken action on the matter.
At the EU Home Secretary's meeting, Orpo, who discussed refugee issues, said on Monday about practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see pictures of the equipment
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkose, a pioneer in the media industry who lost his ability to work because of the attacks is now on sale.
Mikkonen's spouse Nina Mikkonen sells equipment at Huuto.net, which was once one of the most advanced professional equipment in her field.
The online ad was the first to tell online newspaper Iltamakasini.
Today, a large part of the equipment has been left behind by technological progress.
In the digital media world, television shows are no longer on Betacam tapes.
However, Nina Mikkonen is confident that there are interested people.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date in that way, but these too will be needed as long as there is old-generation material that needs to be digitised.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of enthusiasts - collectors and studio builders, Nina Mikkonen ponders for IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset is trying to move away from his current home in Stormlän.
There's no way we can take all the stuff with us.
I have gradually begun to inventory and see what goods are being abandoned.
This is where I started, says Nina Mikkonen.
There is no use for TV and radio equipment of its own anymore.
After recent strokes, it is clear that the man who made a long career will not return to working life.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen's actual life's work was archived already in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up boxes of films and other material from Myrmalä.
Traffic threatens to porridge worse than expected: Metro and trams can stop for the whole Friday
Metro and tram drivers decide today whether they will expand the force in connection with Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram traffic only during the demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon, it will be decided whether the traffic will stop for the whole day.
Pekka Hirvonen, head of trust, says that he is big on the field.
The cuts in night and shift supplements hurt the drivers badly, so the government's plans to cut the sheets cause opposition.
Hirvonen thinks that stopping traffic all day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and tram stop on Friday, public transport in the Greater Helsinki area will be virtually completely stagnant.
According to VR data, trains do not run between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Friday.
On Friday there will be no commuter or long-distance traffic.
The trains that left before 6 a.m. will be driven to the stations of destination.
According to HSL's information, most of the buses stay in the depot.
ACP members will be absent from work on Friday from 3 a.m. to 3 a.m. Saturday morning at 3 a.m.
Most likely a small number of buses can be driven, they are driven by superiors, according to HSL's spokesman Pirkko Repo.
Repo says that HSL cannot tell exactly which bus services will take place on Friday.
Wage-earner organisations organise a grand demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Square on Friday from 11 am to 1 pm.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place on the Hungarian-Serbia border, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, reports the news agency AP.
According to Sky News, refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, Hungarian police would also have used water cannons against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at a school in Texas - the teacher thought a self-made clock was a bomb
In Texas, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after the teacher considered his own-made watch to be a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he only wanted to present the output of his electronics hobby.
But one of the teachers thought the clock looked like a bomb.
The police were called, and the situation ended with the boy being handcuffed to a juvenile detention cell.
Mohamed has never been found to have claimed anything more than that he had made a clock.
Still, it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a fake bomb.
Mohamed said the police had found the watch looked like a "movie bomb."
The clock is in police custody, but it was reportedly composed of a circuit board and a digital display with wires in between.
The incident happened last Monday and Mohamed was punished for three days of compulsory school leave.
His father is furious about the incident and the American-Islamic Council is wondering whether the incident is yet another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain's buzzing - Labour leader refused to sing the national anthem
In the song, God is asked to protect the Queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism of the right-wing press has also been shared by Corbyn's own Labour MPs.
This has offended the people, suspected Labour MP Kate Green in a BBC radio interview.
Green said Corbyn should have joined the song.
Last night's memorial service respected the battle of British air force pilots against German Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corbyn in an official statement and emphasises that he has shown respect to the pilots by participating in the event.
We all owe a huge debt of gratitude to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood with respect in silence during the national anthem, the statement stressed.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided Labour's ranks.
Especially among the MPs, there are those who fear he will banish moderate voters with radical views.
Corbyn is in favour of unilateral disarmament, ending austerity measures and increasing public spending.
For the first time today, Corbyn is to be a party leader in Parliament at Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what to ask Prime Minister David Cameron.
At the turn of the week, Cameron wrote on Twitter about Corbyn's election as party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, economic security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister tweeted with his own account.
The reason for the Minnesota family killing is still unclear - the family's father was facing a lawsuit
The South Lake Mintonka police have been investigating the family killing in Greenwood, Minnesota, for almost a week.
A family of five was found dead in their home on September 10 and a couple of days later the police confirmed that the shooter was their father Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife and three children with a shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead already for days
The family was found after the school had been concerned about the absence of children.
Based on this announcement, the police went to the house for an inspection and found Short's family dead across a huge house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A million-dollar house and a successful company
The investigation of the South Lake Mintonka police chief Michael Siitar is still ongoing.
The motive for the blood work is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and had created his fortune on the social media website AllNurses.com for nurses.
In 2014, in an interview with StarTribune, Short said there were four million different visitors to the site every week.
I have received 50 buy-in offers for the company in the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
Among other things, the success was reflected in the fact that the Short family bought a huge house in Greenwood in 2011 for $2 million.
The house is advertised as a car collector's dream at a real estate site in Zillow: there are not only 12 rooms in the house, but also enough garage for eight cars.
Court case pending
According to StarTribune, however, the family's father was facing a lawsuit.
Achieve Test Prep, who offered various prep courses, had sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, Short's website had not removed any defamatory comments about prep courses, and thus they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a significant impact on Short's business.
Vesku Loiri offered the cake coffee
In addition, the owner trio was awarded at the race event with the Finnish Hippos month's horse owner prize.
This is great, Loiri said in a good mood about his board of honour.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100,000 euros.
Artist legend Loiri was still confused about Fabrice Duo's success in the grand competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
According to Loiri, the coach of the success horse, Korpi, will have a full working peace while working with the horse.
Pekka orders and decides where the horse is going to compete.
And I'm keeping my mouth shut, Loiri blabbergasted.
An amazing gesture from an NHL star - "The greatest donation ever made by an athlete"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P.K. Subban has donated 10 million dollars (about 6.7 million euros) to Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the hospital's announcement, this is the biggest single donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban has committed to helping the hospital with other fundraising for the next seven years.
A year ago, Subban signed a contract with the Canadiens worth eight years and $72 million.
Subban's donation is thus significantly higher than his $9 million annual earnings.
As a reward for his donation, Subban will receive a lobby space bearing its name from the hospital.
Canadiens players have done much to help local hospitals in the past.
Long-term captain Jean Beliveau, who died a year ago, raised millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, and Saku Koivu raised a huge sum of money for another city's major hospital to get the PET scanner needed for cancer studies.
You can order a wife from a Japanese cafe for the evening - served only bikinis and aprons
Theme cafes are a big deal in Japan.
There is already a goat cafe, a rabbit cafe, a vampire cafe, a hug cafe and now a wife cafe.
It strikes the lonely, the sore and hungry.
Metro reported on the matter.
You can order a wife or husband for the evening at the Tokyo-based Ore no Yome cafe.
It is a waiter who pretends to be the client's spouse.
"Half" is selected from the list before coming to the cafe, and he prepares and serves the food.
The wife is facing just an apron and bikini with her husband wearing tight bicycle shorts.
The website provides all the information about the length and weight of the wife candidates to the type of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network: Car security attacks began to be armed
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the field, says Intel's release.
The board consists of top security experts from around the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections to standardise best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time Intel released the first version of best cybersecurity practices.
The company will update the report on the basis of the ASRB's research results.
The international ICT research and consulting company Gartner estimates that by 2020 about 150 million vehicles in traffic will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share web-based data.
We can and must improve cybersecurity in cars, says Chris Young, director of Intel Security.
With the help of ASRB, Intel can establish safety-related best practices and support the view that cybersecurity is a significant ingredient in the design of every car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in data processing.
Ford Focus RS costs about 52,000 euros in Finland!
Ford's Focus RS model has been expected for years like the moon rising.
At last, the car is also in sight in Finland.
Ford released RS's information now that the eyes of the car world are in Frankfurt's car show.
Ford's new four-wheeled RS accelerates from zero to 100 in 4.7 seconds with a 2.3-litre, 350-horsepower engine, with a peak speed of 266 kilometres per hour.
In Finland, the price is also interesting, it is said to be 52,000 euros.
The car is already available to order, though when the first cars will arrive in Finland, Ford does not say in his statement.
The favourite brand Kia introduced two new things at the Frankfurt car show - the new Sportage and Optima
The new fourth-generation Sportage, which Kia plans to catch a larger slice of the ever-growing SUV market, is certainly more important from two new things in Finland.
Sportage, created by Gregory Guillaume, the new European design director, is rounder than before.
A cent has come in between the axles and outside dimensions here and there, and the car splits the air even more efficiently.
The engine range is essentially unchanged, but a 1.6-litre turbo with 177 horsepower has been added to it.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported closer to being sold.
There is still a bit to wait for, because we will have a new Sportage in spring 2016.
Even before the change of year, new Kia Optimat reached our country.
Suddenly, the novelty does not seem to have changed, but it is a completely new car.
Kia plans to conquer the hearts of upper middle class buyers with better driving qualities, lower noise levels and higher quality equipment.
At the beginning, we get Optimos with 1.7-litre turbodiesel and 2.0-litre petrol engines.
Next summer, Optima GT, with a 2.0-litre turbo engine, will accelerate.
About the same time as its arrival, the sale of Optima Farmer begins.
Chisu went back to the stage, ranting in a bold jumpsuit.
Singer Chisu is at the Life for Child concert with other Finnish stars.
There's a spectacular, open neckline in an electric-blue pants suit.
The costume beautifully presents the shrivelling waist of the singer star.
The whole is crowned with a golden metal belt and red lipstick.
During a three-year break, a singer who has become a mother has been able to lose weight with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to turn one year old.
The singer released her first single from a new album in August.
I'm not really nervous about going back to the stage and getting in front of the public after a long break.
I've missed all the music-related things, the singer says.
In a couple of weeks, Chisu will release her new and also fourth album, called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired the making of new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu thinks.
Kim Kardashian's maternity style amazes me again - now you see the breast
The true beauty Kim Kardashian gives talks one after another.
She readily presents her pregnant stomach and chest equipment in sexy clothes, last night at 1 American time when she and her sister Kourtney Kardashian left husband Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent at the breast.
As the lightning lights flash, it reveals the color of the bra under the dress.
The last time Kardashian wore an Amazonic maternity dress was when he visited a friend at a dinner party in New York just a couple of days ago.
Black upper knee boots highlighted the outfit.
The third special maternity outfit is as fresh as last week's Friday, when there was a pregnant stomach on the show.
The hard laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, the competition is terrible
The top model Manon Leloup wanted to correct the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary "Speaking Dolls" in which Leloup and his colleagues speak out about model business.
Harpeer's Bazaar compiled Leloup's six hard truths from behind the scenes.
Every season begins from scratch.
Even if in the previous season you were posing in top designer outfits, the new season will begin again with Castings.
And every season there will be new, fresh faces in the industry that will compete for work with the bad guys.
Models rarely have places to call home.
The work is continuous travel, and it can take even a year to stay in a hotel room or an apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearable.
New York and Paris are the jobs they want, but they are the most stressful.
There is not just one kind of skinnyness.
An agent in New York may ask to drop kilos, but in Paris they say you're too skinny.
Getting a job is always a risky game.
In fashion weeks, models and designers are always together, and at the same time act as a support network.
When fashion weeks are over, the difference is sad.
Models want this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they are devoured by the fact that everyone thinks the job is just a showdown of clothes.
Models want to be their own personalities, too.
The work makes the models feel that they are actors with a role.
But you can also express yourself in the model's work.
Models yesterday at Tory Burch's show.
New York is currently celebrating fashion weeks, where designers reveal their next year's collection.
Roope Salminen, who changed his style, plays the most unknown Apulanta musician in the film
Roope Salminen performs Antti Lautala, the founding member of the band, in a film based on Apulanta's early years.
Lautala founded Apulanta in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but resigned from the band in 1994.
It's a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this film I'm playing a 16-year-old guitar player, Salminen laughs.
I haven't wanted to meet the real Antti before the shoot, because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown to people in that group, so I think it's good that I learn his play style only from video.
I don't want to make an impression about a person.
A completely empty man who runs the Roope Salminen and the Dogs band will not go into the role.
The Punk-managers come naturally to the man.
In the punk episode of stars, stars, I'm sure many people saw a foretaste, the same if they've ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been anything petty, but we always go to the fullest.
Tuukka Temonen, who played the bass in Apulana in 1993-2004, directed by Teitä, was announced today.
The core group that became familiar to the band's audience is presented to the general public by young actors who are still quite unknown.
The drummer Sipe Santapukki will be played by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtasta Tatu Sinissalo bassist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a hint about his future job last night, when he mysteriously told Snapchat he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Roope has already published a picture of his new look in Instagram yesterday, which he has had to carry out for the film.
Scrooge, previously seen in a mustache and chin beard, has shaved his face into smooth cheeks and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: How to tell children about refugees
Many parents have had to think in recent days about how to tell the child about the situation of refugees seeking to enter Europe.
Or is it worth telling?
There is no need to raise the issue by force, SPR crisis group member, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
Smaller children should be protected, for example, not allowed to watch the news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay in their minds and distress, he says.
However, if a child has come across television news pictures of refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth mentioning.
It is good to have a conversation about the child's starting point and to listen carefully to what he is asking.
The child's fears may be surprising.
They are not necessarily the ones the parent thinks he is afraid of.
You don't want to scare a child for nothing, even if you're anxious and scared.
A smaller child closely follows the behaviour of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child also feels safe.
The bigger children are likely to come across a discussion about refugees in school, with friends or online.
It is good for parents to raise the matter with them, if the child is wondering about it.
The fact is that not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents, together with children, can think about how to deal with this in our family.
In the end, though, do we think the world is a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand: If the family also talks about difficult things, the child will get a model of how to deal with difficulties in life.
This could be useful for him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help the weaker"
You're out of your own strength?
You can still be a good parent to your child
It's hard to control the Pallosalamaa that hits Vermo
Perttu Pohjola was able to fine-tune Apilan Pallosalama in midsummer.
It was just going to win and take second place until the end of July in Tampere raves came to a collapse.
Since the stallion was completely clotted, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered an appointment with the vet for his protégé.
The explanation for the shutdown was found in the lookout.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not the mildest in the head, but it took two drops of medicine to overcome it.
Since Apilan Pallosalama had to be in light exercise, Pohjola says he is positively surprised by the last race of the horse.
It was in Turku in its record time the second SE-tamma after Taruntuuli.
Apilan Pallosalama was under a lot of pressure from the break, as it had only been able to drive normally for a few weeks.
Taking those things into account, a slight deflection at the end was understandable, says Pohjola.
The coach assumes that a proper competition was good for the stallion.
The horse's spirit certainly went on from there, and hopefully it would also have stabilised.
Apilan Pallosalama has been so-called humorous horses.
When it hasn't been in the mood, it could have turned fat without getting sick.
Instead, on a good day, the stallion has been released from such a bolt of lightning that the opponents have been amazed.
In short-speed, rivals are not able to compete with Pallosalama, who even loses warm-blooded rides.
In Vermo, there is a race in the hopes of the North.
But the difference is how Apilan Pallosalama will agree to it.
It's pretty hard at the time of departure, and it might stick under the boom of the starting car and all that.
I hope the stallion is calmer already than when Turku leaves.
Apilan Pallosalama can also come from the bow when he is well, and we're going to use it to win, coach promises.
This is why you can't get rid of useless iPhone programs
Tim Cook, CEO of Apple.
At least some of the software that comes with Apple iPhone phones may be removed sometime in the future - but not all.
Apple will possibly remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, says CEO Tim Cook in an interview with Buzzfeed.
Apple's iPhone has a set of programs that relatively few people use: for example FaceTime calls, Lehtikioski, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which came as a mandatory upgrade to iPhone phones, even though it is only necessary for Apple's smart watch owners.
According to Cook, removing Apple's software is more complicated than it looks.
Some apps are linked to someone else on iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems elsewhere on the phone," Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple iPhone apps work closely with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user delete them, Cook added.
So, according to Cook, Apple is investigating, as the company does not want to waste memory space on users' iPhone phones.
Euro area inflation dropped to 0.1 per cent in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only marginally in August, or 0.1 per cent from one year ago, said Eurostat, the EU statistical authority.
The rise in prices was pushed down by lower energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised its estimate of 0.2 per cent from a couple of weeks ago slightly downwards.
In July, inflation was 0.2 per cent.
So-called bottom inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat estimated base inflation at 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2 per cent cheaper last month than one year ago.
The average inflation in the whole EU of 28 countries was zero in August.
In July, the rise was 0.1 per cent.
Consumer prices rose most, or 1.4 per cent, in Malta in August.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest, with prices falling by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent minus the EU's harmonised price index.
Inflation in the euro area remains persistently distant from the European Central Bank's (ECB) target of a 2% increase in prices in the medium term.
The ECB predicts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
Next year the rise will pick up to 1.1 per cent, the Fed anticipates in its new inflation forecasts announced in early September.
U.S. Fed is next trying to tighten monetary policy
The next recession in the United States will begin at its fastest in less than a year, but more confident within three years, after Fed, the country's central bank, will start to raise its interest rates again for a long time.
And in the financial markets, the decline begins before the next recession.
Fed has hinted that it might start raising interest rates already this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
So the next recession can hit you at its fastest by next autumn and as a financial market rate rhythm before that.
Or at least that is what will happen if the world's largest economy and financial markets work as they have done - and if they react to Fed's financial blackmail as they have done before.
These are the conclusions of German bank Deutsche Bank's London market research strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed a 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to its international major customers last week.
The strategists who produced the study and the report do not pretend to know exactly when Fed will start raising its interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market after that.
Instead, they use the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics to show how the economy and the market have previously behaved during and after Fed's interest rates.
In addition to historical observations, they will examine which key variables in the economy and financial markets are now on the same or different model as in previous interest rates - and what might result from that.
It becomes clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now more flimsy to withstand the rise in interest rates than ever before since the 1950s.
Not even a year to start a recession
The leaders who decide on Fed's monetary policy and its current stance have hinted over the summer and early autumn that the time is getting ripe for interest rates.
The first rate increase in more than nine years can start already this week.
The matter will be resolved during Wednesday and Thursday, when the so-called open market committee of Fed's board meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
The last time Fed raised its so-called Fed funds steering rate in June 2006.
That was exactly the end of a two-year series of relatively regular but small interest rates of 0.25 percentage points, with Fed increasing its interest rate from 1.25 percent to 5.25%.
The symptoms of the financial markets began in 2007 with the difficulties of the US's most risky housing funding, and a year later the financial crisis ruptured into a global doomsday nightmare.
The great recession came in 2009.
Last time, serious setbacks in financial markets and the real economy began slower than has typically been the case since previous Fed interest rates.
Similarly, the trials were tougher and harsher than ever since the recession of the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategists have screened the rise and fall of the world's largest economies, as well as the turn of financial markets since 1950 and in some places since the beginning of the 19th century.
Fed's interest rates and their economic and financial impacts will be reported from the 1950s onwards.
Less than a year, mostly less than three years, and an average of less than three and a half years, has passed from the first rate increase to the beginning of the recession.
The rate increase in the financial markets has ended within two years of the start of Fed interest rates.
Fed has, in turn, increased its steering rate by a dozen cycles since the beginning of the 1950s.
Each time has differed from some others, and there are relatively few times in the review, so there is hardly any certainty about the effects of the subsequent interest rates.
The strategies remind us that this time a lot of things are different.
And not just better.
Interests too low for too long
The crucial causes of the financial crisis, let alone the culprits, are not necessarily found beyond doubt even by decades of research.
But for the reasons that led to the crisis and that have increased its destructive power, there are three things that are somewhat beyond doubt clear:
1) In the 2000s, Fed, the euro area ECB and other world's largest central banks considered their key interest rates too low for too long.
They were patching up the tracks of the techno bubble, and they also raised the next one.
2) Over the decades, the amount of debt accumulated and already excessive in the various parts of the financial and real economy grew even greater as a result of the overly lax monetary policy of central banks.
The biggest debt bubble in economic history until then was created.
3) In particular, the crazier debt financing, almost unpredictably packed into the financial economy, swelled the biggest exchange bubbles from shares to real estate, bonds and commodities in most parts of the financial markets up to that point in economic history.
There is hardly a great deal of controversy about the fact that the financial markets that had risen to a height on increasingly complex debt bonds were in a particularly dangerous and unstable state of affairs, as Fed and other central banks last drove up rates.
The financial structures set up on leverage, let alone the valuation bubbles, did not last more than a while after the rate hikes had begun and the cost of debt financing had turned up.
The risks were realised as a financial crisis followed by a major recession.
A bigger bubble and more debt
Deutsche's strategists don't guess what's next, but give a reason to think by mentioning, for example:
1) Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy stance even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower.
2) For a long time, the indebtedness has not been crazier than it was ten years ago, but now the debt money is literally cheaper than free.
So the debt burden in the financial and real economy has not lightened, but now there is a much heavier debt load in different parts of the economy than before or to the financial crisis.
3) The liquidity that has been released from central banks more rapidly and cheaper than before has largely remained in the financial markets and has cost the most important types of securities and assets, whether at the peak of the financial crisis or ever.
And not only do the strategists laxise the mood with financial market warning signals, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and from the worst recession in decades to the way it has been before.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is unusually weak, but correspondingly, the pressures and risks of the financial markets are far greater than before the financial crisis, when Fed next starts tightening its money taps tighter.
Perhaps the future of Albert Edwards, a strategist of the French bank Societe Generale, is not as strange as it suddenly seems.
He has been preparing the bank's international investor customers for Fed's next turnarounds for a good time:
First, Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst - and soon it will be time for Fed to run to put out the financial fires with even bigger QE money syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a computer and printer manufacturer, plans to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the deductions are directed to HP's business service side, says the company.
HP is divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which focuses on corporate sales in November, and HP Inc., which focuses on Pc machines and printers for consumers.
HP's personnel peaked in 2011 when it had 350,000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302,000.
The company records one-off costs of $2.7 billion (about €2.4 billion) in the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will cut 25,000 to 30,000 employees.
The reductions on the consumer side will remain at 3,300 within three years.
HP plans to relocate its operations to low-cost countries so that 60% of its employees would be in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers are responsible for more than 10% of its operating result.
In the year before last, its three most significant customers brought 65 per cent of the operating result.
iOS 9: Apple launches a new operating system - this is how you install it on iPhone
The new operating system can be installed first by selecting Settings, General and Software Update.
If the phone is ready for an update, it will tell you to download and install a new operating system.
Some of the users have had problems since the installation: a "software update failed" error report has appeared on the phone.
In case of error reporting, users are advised to wait for traffic to break out or to attempt an update via iTunes.
The phone will guide you in the charging process.
The update may require the removal of apps in order to release space, but Apple has made the update more compact, and there is also a tool that proposes to remove the apps and reinstall them after the update.
When updating the software, it is worth ensuring that there is a charge on the phone and that the charger is available so that the power doesn't run out in the middle of the download.
If the charge level is too low, the phone will not allow the update to start. If the phone's battery drains in the middle of the update, the update may be broken.
Read more: iOS 9 will be released on time despite WatchOS delay, iOS 9 review: least exciting but best update for iOS 9
It is also worth preparing carefully before downloading the update package to avoid problems in the update - and protect the system against them. iOS 9 brings new features such as a smarter personal assistant and plenty of new features for iPad, as well as small improvements that speed up and improve the operating system.
Yle: Minister Berner has served on the board of the tax haven company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner (central) has served as a member of the board of the tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company's operations involve so-called tax planning.
It is a Luxembourg-based company called Saltri II LuxCo, whose board member Berner was appointed in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg trade register, Berner is still officially a member of the board.
Berner himself says he filed a resignation notice in May of this year.
I checked it out, and that's enough for me to file a notice of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration chains take place on the agreed schedule, Berner says in Yle's interview.
Membership after merger
The ownership of the Swedish company Kährs is managed through the Luxembourg company.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner served on Karelia-Upoflor's board in 2010-2013 and after the merger in Kährs' board of directors and the Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, Kährs' holdings in Luxembourg go through a multi-stage ownership structure.
Berner says to Yle that he accepted board membership at the request of Kährs' second-largest owner in the Luxembourg company.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been on the board of Karelia-Upoflor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was looking for a partner, which was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a venture capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt it was my job to ensure that the benefits of the Finnish family company's capital were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the income from our Finnish companies' capital is taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context, Berner says.
Berner says to Yle that Hartwall Capital's holdings in the company do not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up in the tax haven is due to the fact that Kährs' largest owner, the private equity fund Triton, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
Espoo opens a reception centre maintained by the company
Espoon Otaniemi opens the first company-run reception centre for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 residents already today, starting at 6 pm.
The number of seats may increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre in the real estate of the former Rescue College.
The operations are maintained by Luona Oy, which is particularly active in the production of healthcare and medical services.
The city of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy agree on security arrangements for the centre, among other things.
STTK is preparing an alternative working life tightening package
STTK will start preparing an alternative package for the government's tightening of working life.
The organisation also hopes to include other employee centre organisations.
President Antti Palola said the attention is currently in Friday's demonstration.
Alternative ways of reducing the cost of work will then be returned.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday," Palola pointed out during the break of the organisation's administration meeting to journalists.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) is not prepared for discussions.
STTK economists have calculated that the change security included in the Government's competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated €30 million, compared to €2,700 million on the other side of the package.
I don't know if the party has the greatest enthusiasm to have a conversation if they have a one-to-one relationship with 100.
Palola: Negotiation has been constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is to make a statement about its own package to the parliament and start preparing reforms.
Palola did not take a stand on whether the timetable is realistic.
According to Palola, there is a discussion connection with the government, and it has been constructive to him all along.
According to Palola, the cutting of Sunday supplements is a painful place, especially in the STTK field.
The organisation requires the government to withdraw from the mandatory legislation by which it would carry out some of the blackmails.
According to Palola, the STTK does not warm up to the fact that the alternative package would be prepared with the SDP that has presented the issue.
Employees will meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the Finnish government's tightening-up package presented last week.
As part of the package, for example, the wages for the first sick days will be cut, overtime pay will be halved, Sunday compensation will be reduced to 75 per cent and holidays will be reduced.
The STTK emphasises that the central organisations have invited employees to a demonstration, and the intention was not to organise a strike.
Akavan Fjäder thanks
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder commends STTK's announcement about preparing an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now in line with Akava, as Akava has for a long time outlined an alternative model for government proposals.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without SAK the package will not be comprehensive enough.
Akava President Sture Fjäder hopes that SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will join in preparing the proposal as an alternative to the cuts.
Antti Palola's STTK said earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, Akava announced that it has been preparing its own proposal for a long time to negotiate a five per cent competitive jump that the government is seeking as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has been ready to negotiate all along, and we have long been writing an alternative model for the government's proposals.
We are ready to see the terms of employment as part of the contract.
In return, we want change security and working time banks, says Chairman Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be on Akava's line, as STTK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model for the government and employers of the country, Fjäder says.
The Akava Bureau will meet on Thursday at 3 pm to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
"Same boat, common coal, wills" - playing bingo while Sipilä talks at night
Green Left of the University of Tampere
Vivan bingo coupon for the Green Left at the University of Tampere for the evening.
The prime ministers have previously given special speeches during Mäntsälä's rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of Finland's economy on Yle channels on Wednesday evening at 9:05 pm.
When applying for a similar Prime Minister's previous speech, it is necessary to go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister when he gave a famous radio speech that marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
After that, the president and ministers gave several radio speeches during the winter and further war.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the train performers' strike with a televised speech.
Lonely call, monarchy action
Sipilä's speech has sparked all day's criticism and speculation about what is to come.
Paavo Arhinmäki, president of the Left Alliance, said on Twitter that "Sipilä could give a speech about the state of the nation in parliament as a Prime Minister's announcement, so that the speech could also be discussed."
According to Green Ville Niinistö, "one-calling has already been seen.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
SDP's Erkki Tuomioja condemned Facebook as "monarchist action: the Prime Minister tells the people what's best for them."
SDP chairman Antti Rinne challenged Sipilä to the dialogue: "Soon six months after the election.
Not a single appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's tried.
What is @juhasipila afraid of?
Public service
According to the Government Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and lasts about 15 minutes.
SAK said it was commented on live by SAK president Lauri Lyly and EK CEO Jyri Häkämies.
Yleä has been criticised for making Sipilä's speech.
We considered the matter and said that it is part of the public service mission to promote the full publicity of Finland, a line in Yle's news by Ismo Silvo Yle, Director of Publications.
♪ Like We're in Tammelas time ♪
The speech has also sparked blasphemousness.
When the evening comes, the dinner will be enjoyed in good time, the children will be combed and dressed for their best.
My mother puts on a prettier dress, and my father puts a tie around his neck.
At nine o'clock, the television was silenced as it was in the old days of Me Tammelas," writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä also say in his speech why there are millionaires in the Finnish government who are hiding their capital in tax havens, who make pardon laws for other tax evaders and at the same time claim to the people that they have to cut when the state has run out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
From what Sipilä says, one guess is made by the Green Left Viva of the University of Tampere.
It has published the bingo on Facebook.
Will we hear about the same boat, the common carbon, living in debt and team spirit in the evening?
The coupons and pens are ready, it starts at 9:05 pm and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in the Guardian: Western countries rejected Russia's proposal to overthrow al-Assad
More than three years ago, the West rejected Russia's offer to get Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to give up power, says President Martti Ahtisaari to Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the UN proposed a plan that would have allowed al-Assad to give way in style after a while.
However, the Western countries did not take up the proposal because they believed Al-Assad would fall anyway in a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed a three-point plan in a bilateral discussion: the opposition was not to be armed, the opposition had to be immediately connected to Al-Assad, and the resignation of al-Assad had to be carried out in a subdued manner.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on all things, but we can talk openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said, "Sit down, Martti, and I'll tell him what we have to do," Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
The diplomats do not comment
Ahtisaari says he delivered the message from Tshurkin to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion to the newspaper, but Ahtisaari said there are no two words about it.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said al-Assad's forces had already committed several massacres at that time and the main opposition groups refused any agreements that would have left him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the Middle East Department of the British Foreign Ministry, is hesitant about Ahtisaari's speeches, because, according to his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss Al-Assad's fate.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari's claim is that Tshurkin spoke under Moscow's authority.
If he had told me about what Tshurkin said, I would have replied that I want to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, even then he would have suspected that it was Putin's trick to keep power over some al-Assad supporter.
A flow of refugees from our own works
During the negotiations in Ahtisaari, about 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
According to UN estimates, the number of deaths exceeded 220,000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have had to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees to Europe is our own doing.
I see no alternative but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we ourselves caused," Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
Asylum seeker's organisation centre työllä Tornio
The Government's plan to organise asylum seekers in northern Finland is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in a building in the centre of the city, which is an empty building of the Tornio joint analysis.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable place to better control the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
On Tuesday, Helsingin Sanomat reported that the council would have already decided to present the school building as a space solution to the Ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppinen (left), vice-president of Tornio City Council, that is not true.
When the whole council was not together and some of the group wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he would specify to STT.
There were 36 of the 43 delegates present at the discussion.
The organizing centre was opposed by 13 delegates.
Based on that, one could expect a positive decision, says Hyöppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city received contact on Monday, and a quick response was received.
An estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time could be accommodated in the joint statement.
An expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple of hundred metres from the border, so it would also work in that sense, says Nousiainen.
Sipilä still wants an alternative to blackmail from the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center), the public halving of holiday money would only cover part of the government's goal of reducing the cost of work.
However, the government will be happy to accept an alternative package if the labour market organisations manage to agree on that.
Sipilä told journalists in the parliament that she has not been in contact with labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously the organisations were looking for replacement measures for the government's announced tightening of working life.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä's view, halving the holiday pay would be a tool, since it would target almost all wage earners, unlike, for example, the government's planned cut in Sunday supplements.
Labour market organisations could agree among themselves to cut holiday money because they are written in collective agreements instead of law.
The government will be reporting to the parliament next Wednesday on the tightening of working life as a government statement.
According to Sipilä, the organisations' proposals should be known before this.
This is not the final deadline either.
The legislative work will then begin, i.e. the train will be on the move and it will become increasingly difficult.
There's plenty of time.
It won't take long for things like this to happen, if there is a will, Sipilä said.
The list published by the government last week includes, among other things, the conversion of Epiphany and Helatorista into unpaid holidays without shortening the annual working hours.
In addition, the pay for the first days of illness will be cut, overtime pay will be halved, Sunday compensation will be reduced to 75 per cent and holidays will be reduced.
Reforms are carried out as mandatory legislation past the trade unions, which has attracted strong criticism.
On Friday, wage-earner central organisations are organising a big demonstration for the actions, and several trade unions have declared political strikes.
The council of Tohmajärvi approved the expansion of the Mahlahall warehouse
The council of Tohmajärvi unanimously approved the expansion of the stock of Nordic Koivu Oy, or mahlahall, which is a bit of a nurturing.
The criticism was caused by the fact that the project is bigger and more expensive than was originally said.
Also a busy schedule with heartburn.
There was also a bit of a wonder that the need for space was not known a year ago when the previous expansion was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of the warehouse at 400-450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but the money will be decided later in the interim report.
There was still talk of an investment of between 150 000 and 200 000 euros on the agenda, but at the meeting, technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the price is estimated to be 300,000 euros.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it brings work and tax revenue to the locality.
There is no risk for the municipality, as the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) explained.
There is also room for Karelian language in Joensuu
The city government eased its previous steep stance to bring street name signs in Karelian language to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct in terms of fostering Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of Karelian language, because there are no historical grounds for it, and Karelian language is not a natural part of the region's identity.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more part of the eastern Savonian dialects.
Even after a new decision, there will be no street name signs in Karelian language in the city centre.
However, the City of Joensuu is also ready for Karelian language use, for example in information boards and tourism marketing, on a case-by-case basis.
The city recommends the same approach to all other actors.
Even though Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, it is also worth a broad-minded approach to the use of Karelian language now that multiculturalism lives and changes strongly in North Karelia.
Karelian language is still a peculiarity of the region, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of Finland.
Both can well be used in the multi-disciplinary marketing of the region.
The closure of train connections cuts the vitality of the region
The cuts in train connections hit the vitality of the province with a hard hand.
The transport connections have a direct impact on the region's business life and competitiveness.
And that makes it possible to live and work here in the first place, says Kari Karjalainen, Mayor of Joensuu.
He also highlights air traffic, which has also been the subject of several reflections.
It is important for the whole region that our chances are not reduced by government measures, as is happening now.
We should look at the effects of these traffic closures on employment, for example, Karjalainen emphasises.
The deterioration of transport connections poses a further challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees, says Jukka Mönkkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor connections also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot because of the study.
Marko Junkrinen, the recruitment manager, says that already marketing the university towards western Finland is difficult because the connections are weak in the transverse direction.
Currently, about half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
About 10-20 per cent of them are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by a direct train connection.
Joensuu became one gravel voice for Siu's sote
Joensuu City Board's view of the provincial Siun sote project is seemingly unanimous, but one of the gravel voices is also present.
The city board member Pentti Keskisalo (sd., in the picture) presented the government's Monday meeting to abandon the whole project, but his presentation was unsupportable.
The board approved the draft decision of Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed in early October before the city council meeting, which will make a final statement on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train from Kotka to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger train traffic from Kotka to Kouvola will remain in the future, even if fewer than one pair of trains.
The passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola will change next March.
One pair of trains will be missed, but still five times a day you can get from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The contractions are caused by the state's austerity measures.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications' purchase money for train traffic for the next four-year period will be reduced by 12.3 million euros.
The quieter routes will be completely discontinued.
VR will prepare new timetables by the end of the year.
They will take effect on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed up to the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys walked away
The rescue department let a 12-year-old who climbed the roof out of a jam, who couldn't get off the roof on his own.
The situation arose in Torniomäki, Ketotie, around 5:30 on Tuesday evening.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladder to the roof.
It did not stop the group of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mast of radio amateurs next to it.
The other boys got down the same way, but one didn't.
As a result, others snuck away and passers-by called the rescue department to help the last man on the roof safely back to the ground.
FedEx's turnover variation, weaker outlook for the financial year 2016
FedEx released its last quarter's poor results, and the transport giant weakened its forecast for the whole year due to the fall in demand for freight services and the increased costs of land transport.
The company plans to hire 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
The company's share decreased by about 2.5 per cent 45 minutes before the opening of the actual trading on Wednesday.
FedEx's forecast is $10.40 to $10.90 for the financial year ending in May, which is down 20 cents compared to the previous forecast.
According to a FactSet study, analysts predicted $10.84.
The forecast has weakened the average rate despite the 4.9 per cent price hikes, which will take effect on 4 January, and additional charges for land transport of heavy or large consignments will take effect in November.
The company is still waiting for profit growth from the previous year thanks to cost cuts, higher turnover and growth in e-commerce.
The chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company has performed well in a weaker economic situation than expected, which has especially hit production and global trade.
The plans to hire seasonal workers were announced a day after the competitor UPS announced that it would hire roughly the same number of seasonal workers as last year, i.e. 90 000 to 95 000 people.
In the quarter ending 31 August, FedEx's operating profit was $692 million, which means an increase of six per cent.
The earnings per share were $2.42, and the $2.44 forecast by the 12 analysts at Zacks Investment Research was therefore dropped.
Net sales rose five per cent to $12.3 billion.
According to six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, the turnover was expected to be 12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been hit by a decline in international first-class transmissions, which has caused the company's Express unit to stagnate.
The strong growth in e-commerce has strengthened FedEx Ground's result.
In the last quarter, the net sales of land transport grew by 29 per cent, but the operating profit showed the increased costs of large-scale deliveries and insurance.
The Express unit produced better thanks to higher basic charges, while the freight business's return decreased because of higher labour costs.
About an hour before the actual trading opening, FedEx's share price had dropped by $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
On Tuesday, the share ended up down 11 per cent from the average of the year and 17 per cent below the highest quoted rate recorded on June 11.
This week, the Fed leaders of the U.S. Federal Reserve will meet for the most anticipated meeting in years, and the group will sit by a wooden table of eight metres in diameter in Honduras to decide whether it is time to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
On the wall of the central bank's decorative, two-storey meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues, must put the state's financial interests above all other interests.
The Central Bank has a double order from Congress: maximize employment in the United States and keep prices stable here.
After the Great Depression, however, the central bank's management has taken note of the third unwritten mandate: financial stability.
This mandate may be a missing piece for a tough decision, and on Thursday the Fed is due to announce whether the U.S. economy is ready to begin withdrawal from the unexpected stimulus offered by the short-term interest rates that remained close to zero in the end of 2008.
While most of the data shows a steady growth in the economy, the recent financial turmoil can already scare the prudent central bank officials to increase volatility by increasing the federal tax reference rate - even by a quarter of a percentage point.
"The labour market and inflation are, of course, the first and most important in their practical follow-up," says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the banking firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if the Fed is looking for an excuse not to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty in the global market is enough to keep us waiting," Piegza continues.
Those who have considered the matter do not agree with what the Central Bank intends to do, which in itself causes nervousness.
About half of economists in Bloomberg's study thought of an increase in interest rates this week.
However, in the financial markets, the central bank is expected to be waiting, and according to the main indicator, there is only a 30% chance to raise.
If the central bank raises its key interest rate, the share prices can fall, unless the decision-makers soften the blow by promising a second raise.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 228.89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16 599.85.
"It was the expectation that the central bank would keep the steering rate stable this week," said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed were to raise interest at this stage," he said.
"If this were to happen, the Fed should think carefully about how to keep the hands of those operating in the financial markets unshakable."
The other said that raising interest rates would calm the financial markets and remove uncertainty about when the central bank will operate.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be tilting to raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, which would be the first small step in tightening the financial conditions and thus strengthening the recovery of the United States.
Yellen has said throughout the spring and early summer that he expected interest rates to be raised this year - despite the liberals saying that economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent last month, at its lowest level now in seven years and close to the level that the Fed will count as full employment.
Wage income seems to pick up
While inflation continued to fall below the central bank's annual targets of 2%, the central bank's decision-makers noted that the main reason for this is the steep temporary effect of oil prices.
"The economy can cope with higher rates and needs them, as long as they take account of the tight situation on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However , the financial markets around the world did not startle last month when China devalued its currency .
Dow Jones industrial average dropped by as much as 16 percentage points from the record height of May, and investors feared the Chinese economy's recession would also affect global growth.
The market has picked up this month, and Dow Jones has now dropped by nearly 10 per cent since May's top readings.
The turmoil in the market means that the central bank's decision-makers will become even more complicated to think about the rise in the steering rate.
"The Central Bank's work is becoming more complicated despite what happened in the financial markets and what news has been coming from the deterioration of China's economy in recent weeks," said Stephen D. Oliner, senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Federal Reserve official.
Now he thinks the Fed will wait at least a month to deal with the effects.
"There is a great deal of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy, and there is little reliable information about the situation after the recent development of the Chinese economy," Oliner said.
The reorganisation of the world economy is not the central bank's main concern, so in principle it should not affect the decision-making of the central bank.
In practice, however, the Central Bank is the most powerful player in the world's monetary economy.
The impact of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
In 2013, a mere hint from the then President Ben S. Bernanken that the Federal Reserve could narrow its scope caused upheavals around the world.
In today's world, markets and economies are closely intertwined, and in addition to monitoring world trends, the central bank is also required to communicate with other central banks and experts in order to have a good overview of the global economy.
"The central bank's decision-making process is more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, global strategy manager at Envestnet Inc.
The president, Jeffrey Lacker, from Richmond's regional central bank, said this month that the Fed has previously overreacted to financial market movements that seem to have no connection with the economic pillars.
Mr Lecker, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, has called for an increase in the steering rate, as an example of the decisions taken in 1998 and 1999.
"The economic crisis in Asia led to the Central Bank's decision at three meetings to lower the key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points, even though there were only limited identifiable sanctions available for US economic growth," Mr Lecker said.
A year later, the Fed overturned the decision.
"The Central Bank should put monetary stability first only in a major crisis, such as the 2008 economic collapse," said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England interest rate committee.
The latest turmoil does not even draw closer to the situation at the time," he said.
"There's no reason to be afraid of raising interest because of the shock of the market," Peterson Institute for International Economics said.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention monetary stability, and until this changes, I don't think we should get ahead of ourselves."

Brazil's Rio Grande Pediatric Association promotes a decent diet for breast-feeding
Brazil's Rio Grande Pediatric Association SPRS has developed a blinding way of teaching breastfeeding women the meaning of a decent diet, showing them pictures of babies breastfed from a breast painted with images of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk is made up of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, allowing the baby to get all the food it needs and to develop a strong immune system.
Because of the extra energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 kilocalories.
According to a new study, in addition to increasing calorie levels, other changes to diet should be made.
A recent study by Baylor College of Medicine professor Robert Waterland in Texas revealed that a pregnant woman's healthy diet can affect the baby's genes and protect the baby from tumor development.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the child's immune system.
Seven Sunrise has the most viewers, even though Nine is trying to get a lead on his Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson went to Canberra to do a morning show about the aftermath of the Liberal leader's election, but that didn't really improve Today's ratings.
Nine's morning programme was sent from the capital after Malcolm Turnbull had replaced Tony Abbott.
David Koch and Samantha Armytage, on the other hand, broadcast the morning program of the competing channel from London, and the week-long special broadcasts from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
It seems that the distance did not matter to Australian television viewers, since Sunrise watched an average of 397,000 viewers in five state capitals, while Today's programme was 339,000.
Today's ratings rose slightly compared to last Monday (317,000) and Tuesday (283,000), but missed reading last Thursday (343,000).
Today has reached a close distance to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average of 318,000 viewers, Sunrinen had 330 000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
In September Sunrise has so far reached an average of 349 000 viewers and Today 314 000 viewers.
Here's the most interesting event this morning.
The winds of change will have a greater effect on Parliament this morning.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!

Seven had a significant novelty of 800 Words, including former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama is about a recently widowed father who decides to move to the New Zealand coast with his two children, and the new series reached a huge 1 219 000 viewers.
Critics have suspected whether Thomson would be enough to star the hit series alone, without Rafters star Rebecca Gibson.
According to last night's ratings, the answer is clearly positive.
Seven's The X Factor maintained a strong position with 1,16,000 viewers, a series that brightly defeated The Block (838,000) and TBL's Families (726,000).
Seven's The Chase Australia has imprisoned viewers in varying degrees.
An average of 446,000 viewers followed the first half-hour of the new quiz series hosted by Andrew O'Keefe (17.00-17.30).
In the second half-hour (17.30–18.00), the ratings rose to 623,000, which was more than Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, The Chase Australia's first half had an average of 520,000 viewers, and the other half gathered a huge 720 000 viewers.
Hot Seat had 620,000 viewers.
The Chase Australia's second-night ratings showed Nine that Hot Seat will pass at 5.30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minutes, who could not challenge McGuire's show.

The final trio thinks Sam Wood really is the Bachelor of Dreams - but who does he choose?
Did the secret come out? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markkoski may have inadvertently revealed the bachelor's choice.
The final choice of the bachelor Sam Wood has been a carefully preserved secret.
The three remaining women will not say a word about who has received the last rose from the bachelor.
We asked questions about Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows before one of the trio was dropped, and the women could inadvertently suggest who will be the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are tightly sealed until Thursday's final.
All three women praised Wood as the perfect man, boasting his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness, and considering him to be a suitable partner for himself.
When women were asked who would be the most suitable partner for Wood, if the last rose didn't hit its own surface, their answers can give an indication of who would take the bachelor's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay after themselves as the most suitable partner for Wood.
Everything has been easy between Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood from the beginning.
"As soon as I got to the house, I noticed that Sarah and Sam fit well, and this feeling has been preserved throughout the program," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah has feet on the ground, and she is really fun to be around," Markoski added.
"I've seen them together, and I have to admit there's chemistry between them.
They seem like a natural couple.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood are a good couple.
Mackay said he realized last week on a hometown date that Wood could be the one.
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this wasn't just a race, and I'm putting a lot of effort into our relationship now," Mackay said.
When Mackay was asked who Wood should choose if he didn't choose him, she mysteriously replied:
"I can't say," he said.
"I like the other girls as much as you do, and Sneza and Lana are equal."
The bachelor of dreams on Ten on Wednesday at 7.30 pm.

Jarryd Hayne has several options to start an NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hayne after she moved to the United States, and several other clubs also took an interest in him after an impressive open day of training last year.
Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and the choice seems to have hit it.
Some coaches would have held Hayne on the bench, as the man did with the Australian rugby national team. Hayne screwed up the kickback after the team took a victory from Minnesota on Tuesday from 20 to 3.
However, Tomsula showed her confidence in Hayne and gave the man another chance to return the flight kick, and the coach kept Hayne in the game after Reggie Bush got hurt.
Tomsula also continued to line up in the locker room after the game.
He wasn't blaring in front of the rest of the team, he was encouraging them.
Tomsula also publicly defended Hayne at a press conference after the game.
49ers' specialist Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget about the failed capture and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne screws up the catch, the first quarter of the game against Minnesota Vikings.
Hayne and her Australian fan groups had expected something else from his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after a failure and later told Hamish and Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn't have imagined a worse start for his NFL career.
"These things happen, and we have to move on," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the error to his debut in the State of Origin series in 2007 when his pass in his own area opened a place for Queensland.
Overall, the experience was still incredible for a 27-year-old youth.
Hayne posted a photo on Instagram, posing together with fans and Australia's flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested at gunpoint at the airport in Siberia.
Hodorkovsky, who openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, was convicted, Jukos, a man-owned oil company, was liquidated, and his work in favour of democracy was limited.
Four dead police officers fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people died in southern Nepal, a source of government said on Wednesday, and police fired rubber bullets at a crowd in a protest against the alleged new constitution of the country, including a four-year-old boy.
The violence occurred Tuesday evening in the Rupandeh area, just under 300 kilometres from the capital Kathandus.
District chief Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, some of them throwing rocks and fire bombs.
Dhakal said the police used tear gas and fired into the air before firing rubber bullets.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded.
It is not quite clear why rubber bullets, which can kill but are generally considered a less destructive option, were suddenly so deadly.
It was the most recent confrontation in weeks of protests in the southern plains of Nepal, where, according to the Madhesi tribe, new provinces based on the new constitution would weaken their political influence.
Protests have also been seen in Western Nepal, where the Tharus tribe demands its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have died in violent clashes since 10 August,
when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, a significant step towards a new constitution, but the subject is very sensitive in Nepal, where the government has been centralized for centuries.
The new constitution has been working on since 2008, but the process was accelerated by legislators after thousands of people died in the tragic earthquake in April.
The legislators have voted on constitutional clauses in Kathmandu this week, and according to the authorities, the new charter could be adopted by Sunday.
NHC Hurricane Center: 60 percent probability for cyclone south of Cape Verde
From a vast low-pressure area about 560 kilometres from the southernmost parts of Cape Verde, 60 per cent of the chances could develop a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, reported the National Hurricane Center on Tuesday.
According to the Miami Meteorological Institute, Cape Verde and the Little Antilles also have a clear low-pressure centre, which can also be 60 percent likely to develop into a tropical cyclone in the next two days.
Google plans to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GooGL.O) announced the launch of a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian aid organisations that help thousands of people fleeing war and poverty across Europe.
Google announced a donation campaign on its blog in a particularly personal way.
Instead of leadership, Google employee Rita Masoud launched the campaign by telling about her own experiences, who was only seven years old when she fled Kabul with her family.
"We traveled in the dark by train and bus and were hungry, thirsty, cold and afraid," Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
After the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has escalated, many families in a similar situation are desperately in need of help.
Donations are directed to non-profit organisations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children Association and UN refugee organisation.
When donations have been collected via google.com/refugeerelief for $5.5 million, Google promises to donate an equivalent amount, reaching 11 million.
The refugee crisis in Europe is at its worst since World War II, especially the four-year civil war in Syria, which has forced more than four million people this year to flee their homes.
The war will also have to escape from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Mildly overweight diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery
According to a new study, mildly overweight type 2 diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether mildly overweight type 2 diabetics will live longer after a obesity surgery than those receiving unsected treatments.
"It takes time to get the mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery, who discussed a new study in JAMA Surgery.
The procedure of obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, reduces the stomach by different methods.
Surgical methods reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food in the body.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been found to be effective treatments in type 2 diabetes, but most of the studies have involved people who are physically overweight and have a BMI of 35 or more.
Body mass index indicates weight and height, where normal value is 18.5-24.9.
When the BMI is over 25, the person is overweight, and the BMI of over 30 shows significant obesity.
You can calculate your own BMI at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In a new study, researchers at the University of Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 in a study comparing two methods of obesity surgery, gastric bypass surgery and sleeve surgery, to the treatment of mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes.
After obesity surgery, the average body mass index dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of the study.
The BMI of those who were unsected remained close to 29.
The total improvement in the diabetes of those undergoing surgery was 36% and in part 28%.
In the drug-treated group, diabetes resolved in full by only 1% and in part by only about 2%.
The study also showed that blood pressure, triglycerides and bad LDL cholesterol were better in the surgical group.
Researchers also monitored patients' haemoglobin-A1c levels, which reflect the development of blood sugar levels.
According to researchers, the recommended haemoglobin-A1c level is less than 7%.
After surgery, the mean decrease in haemoglobin-A1c from 9% to 6%.
In the group of drug-treated patients, the value remained unchanged at about 8 per cent.
The hemoglobin A1c level is about controlling blood sugar levels, but a study group led by Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu said that this did not reduce mortality over five years.
The study group also compared the consequences of two different methods of surgery.
In the fifth year, the weight loss in the gastric bypass surgery group was higher than in the sleeve surgery group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), the body mass index drop was higher (7.4 and 5.1), as well as the hemoglobin A1c levels (3.1 per cent and 2.1 per cent), and diabetes in the bypass surgery group was completely improved in a larger proportion (46.9 per cent and 16.7 per cent).
The new study could not show a lower mortality rate after five years, but according to a Swedish study by the University of Arizona College of Medicine, Blackstone of Phoenix, surgery will bring years of life to fat people.
In a Swedish study, the obese people who had gastric bypass surgery were less likely to die in 15 years than in the conventional treatment group.
Although no lower mortality was found in the new study, Blackstone said it was confirmed that people with a BMI of less than 35 could benefit from the procedure.
"This is the most important finding in the study, since it says the surgery is safe in a lower body mass index group and does not increase the risk of death or kidney disease," Blackstone wrote.
According to Blackstone, people and doctors should take weight seriously when the body mass index is 27-30.
"We wait too long for people to take the situation seriously," the researcher said.
"When a person's body has accumulated genetic changes that expose them to obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation."
"Not everyone can come to Europe" Dalai Lama – RT News
Europe is not able to receive all the refugees, Dalai Lama said, and he said the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to the violence in the refugees' home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the refugee crisis in a speech during a visit to the UK, and the Dalai Lama gave a speech at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion Centre in Oxford, which focuses on ethical research.
According to the Dalai Lama, in the current situation, humanity must take precedence over individual countries or continents.
He also stressed that while Western European countries' response to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is not enough in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," Dalai Lama said in her speech.
Despite thanking Germany and Austria for their efforts in the crisis, the Dalai Lama stressed that the solution was only temporary.
"Caring for thousands of refugees is a great act, but at the same time there are long-term solutions to consider and how we can achieve genuine peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education," Dalai Lama stressed.
"In the end, we need to think about how we can reduce the killing in these countries.
The use of force must be reduced.
Force has never solved problems," he added.
Speaking of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions in the 11 September terrorist attacks, claiming that when he resorted to force in response to the terrorist attack, the United States created an uncontrolled chain of events.
"After the attacks on September 11, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution would come through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he resorted to force with unpredictable consequences," Dalai Lama said.
The case of handicraft swallowing quadrupled in children in four years
According to Georgia's Poison Center, poison centres across the United States reported nearly four-fold increase in alcohol-intensive hand sanitizer cases in children under 12 years of age since 2010.
According to Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Centre, the cases of handicraft swallowing reported to poison centres in children under 12 years of age increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"These products are more and more accessible to children, and unfortunately some of the children are going to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
According to Lopez, children drink hand sanitizers intentionally, some to impress their friends and some to be encouraged by social media.
There are teenagers in YouTube videos who drink disinfectant because of cheap hops.
Teenagers are said to mix alcohol-rich mouthwash with disinfectant to make the drink stronger.
Smaller children can be attracted to the scent of hand sanitizers.
"The child doesn't think the drug is bad," Lopez said.
"Most of the attractive hand sanitizer products are just perfumed.
There are strawberry, grape and orange-flavored hand sanitizer products that appeal to children."
The alcohol content of the disinfectants is between 45 and 95 per cent.
Even a small number of young children can cause alcohol poisoning.
"The alcoholic strength of the hand is very high," Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Center for Poisoning at Kansas University Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
"No one would leave a whiskey shot within the reach of children, but if hand sanitizer products are often left available to children, they quickly produce a large amount of alcohol."
The six-year-old Nhaijah Russell recently had four slobs of strawberry-scented hand sanitizers at school, and the girl was delivered to the emergency room for treatment.
"The girl's blood alcohol level was 179, which is twice the adult's drunk limit," said Chris Ritchey, a doctor from Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Nhaiiah was squirming and was unable to walk when he was brought to the emergency room.
Doctors followed the girl's condition overnight in a separate children's hospital in case of brain damage, as she had fallen and hit her head after drinking alcohol," Ritchey said.
"It was really scary," Nhaiiah's mother Ortoria Scott said to CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products and alcohol swabs in addition to transferring your hands away from children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing hand sanitizers containing a toxic substance that had not been reported.
Health authorities thought the product contained lethal methanol instead of ethyl alcohol, even though the latter is reported as an active substance in the label.
According to a police report, three fourth grade students in the north of New York were planning in January to kill a "bad" teacher by placing antibacterial products around the classroom.
The teacher is extremely allergic to handicrafts and banned it from being brought to the classroom.
The police considered that the plan that had gone wrong was meaningless and urged the school to take disciplinary action.
Rumourmill: No discord among Celtic

The Dutch miss an old Scottish pair of battles – de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because they are no longer allowed to watch Celtic and Rangers double-crossing.
De Boer, who works for Ajax's team leader, said: "There will be no more Celtic highlights in Holland.
Because the Rangers are no longer involved.
"It's not just the Rangers' return that we're talking about here.
They're talking about Old Firm here.
The Dutch are looking for team-to-team struggles.
The games of Old Firm have a huge tension, and they are also interesting beyond Scotland's borders."
I'm turning the situation around, Deila assures
Ronny Deila admits Celtic is having a hard time, but the Norwegian pilot assures that the situation will change.
The club lost to Malmö fell from the Champions League and lost ten players to Aberdeen, who now has a five-point lead at the top of the table.
"Celtic has had difficult episodes before, and we will rise again," Deila said.
"We want to improve our situation as quickly as possible.
The situation is very frustrating, and it is a source of hatred or grief for many.
So do we, but we have to move on.
We desperately need the support of Celtic supporters, as it will significantly strengthen the players.
The spirit of cooperation is really important now."
Warburton cautious in January's player transfers
Even though only a few weeks ago Rangers boss Mark Warburton hinted about January's transfer targets, he is cautious about the transfer rumble and says he wants to compromise the team's unity.
"The players' transfers in January differ significantly from the summer's transfers," Brentford's ex-coach said.
"The players joining the team in the summer will be able to get used to the team before the start of the season, which has been a success in our lineup this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes unnecessary player acquisitions can cause the team more harm than benefits."
Michu, who thinks about retirement in Celtic's aim
Swansea's attacker Michu has been linked to Celtic in player transfer speeches, while Michu has hinted about retiring after the Swans contract ended.
For years, 29-year-old Michu has been plagued with an angry ankle and failed to get a transfer from Wales in the summer.
Hearts ready for SFA on Neilson comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field. The team finally lost 3-2. The defender's red card was later reversed. It's already the third Collum red card in eight months, which will be revoked.
But Neilson remains behind his words. "I didn't question honesty. I didn't comment on the performance.
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
Griffiths was rebuked when the man admitted that he had slanderous songs about the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Edinburgh Roseburn region before the Edinburgh local match in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"There was a local match, and the atmosphere was intense," the attacker said. "I can guarantee I won't go back to Tynecastle except for Celtic."
Tannadice's management team believes in Dundee United's coaching management – Donnelly
Simon Donnelly assures us that Dundee United's leadership team can make the situation better, and extradition in the field can no longer be allowed.
"Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready to fight," Donnelly said.
McInnes satisfied Hamilton win with dirty play
Derek McInnes admits that Aberdeen was desperate to stand up to Hamilton in front of his seventh consecutive league win, and with victory Aberdeen caught a five-point neck at Celtic's top of the serial board, thanks to Adam Rooney's punishment in the first half.
"There is no cup or league winner team that would not have won games like this," McInnes said.
Unemployment unchanged in Scotland, growing in the British Isles
The number of unemployed remained unchanged in Scotland between May and July, with 164 000 unemployed, while in the UK the number of unemployed increased by 10,000.
According to the UK Statistical Office (Office for National Statistics), the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9 per cent, compared with 5.5 per cent in the UK as a whole.
There are 12,000 fewer people in work in Scotland than three months earlier, and now the number of those in work is 2,612,000.
Scotland's employment rate fell to 74.0% in the quarter, with the UK's average employment rate being 73.5 percent.
Scottish Minister David Mundell commented on the recent figures: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a strong economy."
Nearly exactly a year ago, Scotland made a historic decision to remain a part of the UK.
The labour market situation in Scotland has improved over the past year: and unemployment has decreased.
Why am I watching the execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, if there is no legal basis for cancellation, I will follow the execution.
If the execution is carried out, which I do not wish for, I will sit in the execution room of Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed with a poison injection.
Glossip has asked me to be one of four official witnesses.
I received an invitation in January through a man's best friend, and despite my shock, I replied yes.
As the day draws near, I'm terrified.
Then why did I say yes?
I said yes because I thought I could tell a true story about the death penalty in this way.
The perspective would be unique.
Journalists are allowed to watch executions in the United States, and since there are more applications than seats, the participants are selected with a macabre draw.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of journalists from 12 to 5.
The chosen will follow the execution in a moderate manner.
I can't do it.
I'm sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've created a personal relationship with him, because we've talked on the phone several times over the months, and one of my visits lasted two and a half hours.
I like this man.
We laugh often when we talk.
According to the prison staff, I cannot be present as both a witness and a journalist, so I am not allowed to carry a notebook and a pen to take notes.
I just have to try to remember the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of endangering neutrality.
"This is the basic idea:
When you tell a doomed story in a way that pleases him, you will get close to him."
I expressed my disagreement with the reporter.
The reporter woman admitted that she could have formulated her words more carefully, but still thinks my actions are wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he tries to tell me what to do, I wouldn't do it.
I've told him he can remove me from the witness list at any time.
However, he wants an international journalist who can write about what happened.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will contribute to the movement against the death penalty.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware will be sitting next to me.
If you want more information about the subject, you can listen to my podcast.
I will not repeat the details in this context.
I can't say Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Tree's murder would make him guilty of assistance after the crime.
However, I believe it is very likely that the man Glossip has not committed the murder.
I absolutely believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I will follow his execution.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
An objective description can be read from other journalists' stories.
I'll tell you what it feels like to watch a man die in vain.
The man was lured from Canning River after a watery police hunt
An officer in the Canning Vale area remained dry when he lured the man up from the Canning River.
The Perthian man's attempt to escape was bogged down in shallow, muddy water, and a police officer a few metres away managed to get the man back to dry land.
Canning Vale Police received a call on Tuesday for an unauthorized stay in Beckenham.
When the police arrived, they spotted a suspect who tried to shake off the police by heading for the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"The man standing in the water said he wouldn't come out of the water and told the police to get him in the water," Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec was not attracted to watering the uniform, so he chose a safer tactic - a negotiation.
"Sometimes an attempt to escape causes people to resort to amusing methods," Sergeant Castledine said.
The case of football champion Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid the police blowing and tried to swim across the Swan River.
The man's attempt was doomed, but the stunt inspired the locals to plan Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody said the officials tried to spy and threatened to stop competing
Peter Moody blamed Racing Victoria's suppliers for attempting to spy on his stables last year, threatening to stop racing immediately.
Moody claims that he has been personally attacked by officials and by Racing Victoria's integrity department, and the rejection of Lady Tatai due to the recent treatment on the day of the race was the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he had always tried to work for racing, and that Moody has been in a difficult situation when Lidar's sample found cobalt and the man was unable to explain the discovery.
Moody has been keeping his tongue in check for a year and a half for spying accusations, and he didn't want the accusations to look like a bitter man's act.
"I wasn't going to raise the issue, and I thought about it for a long time, but sometimes frustration breaks out once and for all," Moody said.
"They know what really happened."
"Sometimes I have to react and accept the consequences, and now I have to accept the condition after I opened my mouth.
I go home and sleep well at night.
I want to walk upright, and I want the owners of the horses to think I'm doing the best I can.
If the owners don't believe that, I don't think I should continue as a horse coach anymore.
I would have to think about my future as a licensed coach."
Moody dropped the bomb earlier in an interview with Racing.com, where he told about the integrity department's espionage attempts at his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered a man a job in my stable to spy on my actions, and I'll tell him his name on request," Moody said to Racing.com.
"They clearly believe I'm a fraud.
If so, they should present evidence, since I have not been caught of anything illegal.
Robert Roulston, former president of the RFL, David Moody, current president of the RFL, and Bernard Sundry, current CEO of the RFL, were aware of the action then and now.
Should I view the situation as a personal pursuit?
Should the RFL take action and place responsibility for the situation in the sector on non-coachers?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I really bad for the industry?
Maybe a lot of people think so.
Maybe I'd still have a training license and push me away from my duties, and there's no doubt I'm talking about making a lot of people think that.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, which is sad.
It's really sad.
I pressure them to make their decision.
My family supports me, and I can withdraw."
The long-standing Lidar's cobalt test and the recent rejection caused the coach to become frustrated in the end, threatening to give up his licence.
Moody is best known as the coach of the unbeaten champion Black Caviar, who described the day-of-the-race rule as ridiculous after the horse's feet had an irregularly placed clay wrap.
"The treatment is against the rules.
I take full responsibility for that," Moody said.
"A person from my staff mistakenly put clay on a horse's foot.
The clay treatment could have been done last night.
It could have been done yesterday during the day, and it did.
But it happened on the day of the race."
Moody can be expected to be banned for three months from the irregular clay treatment that the organisers have begun to work on.
"This is a joke.
The rules have been drawn up by someone who doesn't know horses at all.
Everyone understands the need for rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Arrested who escaped Cobram's crash scene
The police have arrested the man who hit the cyclist this weekend who escaped from the crash scene.
A cyclist was taken by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital and suffered serious injuries after a car hit him on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
According to the police, the man driving the car fled the scene and did not stay to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old from Nathalia reported to the police at Shepparton.
The man is likely to be charged with failing to stop and assist in a traffic accident and other traffic offences.
A 40-year-old cyclist from Cobram is still in hospital and is stable.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy points to opponents' wrestling speeches
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy considers the criticism of his team's tackle game to be a goal-oriented action by NRL's two league favourites.
According to Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson, the judges allowed Storm to wrestle in a qualifying match in Sydney on Friday night to be a pain in the hands of Melbourne's masters.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely covered up the reference to Storm after Broncos won the qualifier final on Saturday night at Queensland Cowboys, calling the game a model match, saying Queensland doesn't care about wrestling.
Bellamy defended his own team's tackle and said they only focused on contact when tackling.
Bellamy added that his trust in his own team was enhanced by the fact that his team was criticised by two top teams' coaches, which Bellamy sees as an indication that the coaches are worried about losing to Storm.
"This thing always comes up. As I recall, Trent Robinson didn't say anything about wrestling when his team beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I guarantee we haven't changed anything in our defence system or in our techniques all year, and for the last six weeks, we've just been investing in contact games and tackles that have turned us into a rise.
Trent has been on a mission for three years, and he may have been shocked to lose because he has a great team that isn't used to losing.
It's funny that the same thing always comes up at the same time of the year.
Bellamy did not agree with Bennett about what is interesting football, reminding his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010 by playing boring football.
"Wayne talks about interesting football.
He compared his team's game from Saturday to ours on Friday and found their game interesting," Bellamy said.
"In 2010, St George got a lot of criticism from his boring game, and Wayne said he won't get a drop of criticism.
Now he has a team that can play so-called football, especially his young, fast backseaters.
That's the kind of football you want to play when a player-army is like this.
He emphasised this in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play in his style, and not all teams have central attackers like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
This gives me more confidence when other coaches are so concerned about facing my team that they resort to something like this.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think they'd meet us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that Storm and Roosters scored more goals than Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, and I haven't seen it, but what was the result? 16-12?
The result of our game was 20-18. There were more situations in our game, but is it interesting football?
Or are the breaks and the low-martism interesting football?
I think the goals make it interesting.
If they mention us, we will probably meet them."
Storm has a free weekend, as the team will have either the North Queensland Cowboys Cronulla on the upcoming Saturday at AAMI Park, which will be on sale on Tuesday morning.
Serbian man released on $200,000 bail in a drug case
A man waiting to be sentenced for a possible life sentence for an attempted possession of 40 kilos of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after the police found 100 kilos of cocaine on a Solay ship that had come through Vanuatu from South America and arrived at Coomera harbour in August.
The police watched a meeting with Maksimovic and an accomplice at the marina in the morning, and the two later surprised the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, and a 40-pound shipment of drugs was found in a Toyota Echo car parked in the parking lot.
Although Maksimovic is potentially looking for life in life for possession of a drug for commercial purposes, his lawyer says there is no evidence that his client tried to take over the whole batch, but the man may have been in the cafe for an innocent purpose.
According to Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan, there is a risk that Maksimovic will try to escape the country.
"Maksimovic clearly has connections with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia frequently," the judge said in court on Wednesday.
"He lied to the police about where he lived."
Maximovic's mother and stepfather together paid 200,000 bail, against which he was released.
"After reading the sworn testimony of both people, it is clear that $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
"But that alone is not enough to prevent a man's escape," the judge warned.
Maksimovic was released on condition that he surrenders both his Australian and Serbian passports, reports to the police every day, and stays home from six in the morning to six in the morning.
Stevan Hogg used her phone to get pedophiles to send pictures
The paedophile used the 11-year-old girl's phone to gain control of pictures of children being abused.
Stevan Hogg took the phone while the girl was sleeping and logged into an online messaging service, where he got another user to send unseemly pictures of the children.
Later, when she woke up, she noticed the phone was missing, and she was sleeping in Hogg's hand.
As she looked at the contents of her phone, she found shocking messages and immediately told her mother.
The five photos were reported to the police, and after studying the computers found at the address, the police found disturbing Internet searches using keywords to search for inappropriate child pictures.
Hogg claimed to have tried to mislead the paedophiles on the Internet and to pretend to be a police officer with the intention of scaring the paedophiles.
D.A. Eilidh Robertson said in the local court at Dundee Sheriff Court: "The man claimed to be addicted to intimidation.
He admitted to doing the searches on the computer, but claimed to have done so to play police and thus to scare the paedophiles.
Hogg was asked about the conversations with an unknown person who had sent the photos to him and from whom Hogg had asked for more pictures.
Hogg claimed that his purpose was to mislead the paedophiles.
He said he got disturbing thoughts while drinking and wanted to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added: "When she found the messages from the phone, she cried out to her mother, shaking and crying."
The girl saw inappropriate photos on the phone, after which Hogg was questioned.
The girl said the accused used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger.
23-year-old Hogg Dundeen from Ward Road confessed to charges of possession of inappropriate child pictures on June 14 last year, and Hogg violated bail on January 25 this year and failed to appear in court for hearing on March 24 this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked not to put Hogg in the register of sex offenders, as it could be considered that the crime did not contain significant sexual features.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence to October because of social work background reports.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody on other grounds.
Hogg was added to the sex offenders register even before the date of the sentence.
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe gives the wrong speech in parliament
The oldest head of state in Africa, Mugabe, fell on the steps leading to the podium earlier this year.
Mugabe was not injured, but the video of what happened quickly spread on social media.
The opening of the parliament was also overshadowed by claims from opposition party legislators that they have received anonymous death threats warning them against booing Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, MPs booed and interrupted the President's speech on the state situation in parliament, and the President gave the same speech on Tuesday.
The MDC bishop Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians received text messages urging them not to interfere with Mugabe's speeches.
"The message has been sent from an unknown number, but the title of the message is "death," Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warns the recipients that outside the parliament the representatives are no longer immune.
According to the party's whipper, the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is concerned about threats against politicians.
Hewlett-Packard cuts up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard plans to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of the restructuring and savings of the business services business.
HP is divided into two listed companies later this year and separates the computer and printer business from faster-growing corporate hardware and service operations.
According to HP's press release, the company will record one-off costs of $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter.
"The restructuring will allow a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said HP's CEO Meg Whitman, who runs the company after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a company smaller and more focused than the current HP, and we have a large and deep portfolio of business operations that will help companies move into a new business style." Whitman said.
"As a company of our own, our position is better than ever and we are better able to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual turnover is over $50 billion, and according to its mission, the company will focus on delivering unique integrated technology solutions to companies.
The company, founded in the 1930s by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, raised by Stanford University, is now divided into two companies, an electronics company founded in a garage in Palo Alto, which is now considered to be the birthplace of Silicon Valley.
There have been massive restructurings at HP as traditional desktop computers are moving to mobile devices.
The changes in the world's second-largest computer manufacturer and HP, one of the biggest technology companies in the United States, are the latest move in an industry that believes concentration will bring success.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta: The team must support the injured Jack Wilshere before meeting Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is only September. If everything goes well with a rehabilitation plan, there is no reason why he could not return to the airport already in December.
The best possible scenario means that Wilshere will certainly have to skip at least the next four England national team games, and, knowing his history, his involvement in the European Championships is clearly unclear.
The biggest trouble with the latest problem is that Wilshere decided last season after a severe ankle injury and seemed to have returned to his former blade under the new season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten your career," Wenger said.
"The bone didn't heal properly.
It's not a serious injury.
It was just an accident.
It had nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries."
Medically, this may be the case, but, as Wenger said, there may be further injuries when the player tries to return to the field in the middle of the season.
There is also an unpleasant regularity here.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different types of trouble since Wilshere debuted six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of the total 157 league matches in the last five seasons.
The broader picture of Arsenal is that since 2007-2008, six out of eight seasons, the team has been the second of the teams that lost most money due to injuries.
Wenger accepts a possible vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that the improved injury statistics last season will continue to improve.
"Sometimes the return after the injury can be accompanied by a vulnerable period, when you need to strengthen your body and apply for competitive advantages," Wenger said.
"Jack is young, so he'll get through this.
I hope he can balance his body, and I believe it, and with it, his career will continue as he deserves."
Arsenal will begin his Champions League work on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, after which the team will meet Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur the next Wednesday, and Wenger will prepare small changes to the lineup.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to begin.
Wenger can also put Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to take care of the balance of the team and give rest to those who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite to continue with the F Group, Maksimir Zagreb is one of Europe's scariest stadiums.
Dinamo has also been an unbeaten 41-game team.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night, as the country was shaking at 3.2 on the Richter scale.
The earthquake was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned his lesson from last season after having had to yield to Monaco, and is still motivated by the distant hope of piloting the team towards the European Championship.
"We have a huge energy charge," Wenger said.
"Arsenal has not yet been hit by this title.
We were very close in 2006. On the other hand, with experience, I'm also a realist.
We are ambitious but not dreamers."
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us the truths about male friendship
A similar description shines with its absence in other series, which is noteworthy, especially given that men's need to open up is greater than ever, and young men's suicide statistics are at their highest in 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the most significant cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and suicide is three times more common among men than among women.
Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) tackles the problem by declaring 2015 men's year to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking the help they need.
Friendship is the ultimate idea of the challenge.
In a recent study, 2,000 high school students were interviewed, and the study found that those with depression symptoms have a better chance of healing if they are surrounded by enough healthy people.
The incidence of asymptomatic people was also halved if they had people close to them who do not have mental health problems.
But it's all based on friendships.
Modern communication is dominated by social media, and the communication style is often more important than content, and rapid response is often considered more important than meaningful contact.
With the digitalisation of life, the need to look strong, fun and successful doubled, even though isolation is a reality.
The external values, money, image and social status associated with superficial success all take attention from internal values and our natural desire for personal growth and friendship, and the inner values seem to be deeper into our mental health.
A millionaire in the video game industry recently said that money can't really buy happiness.
The great thing about Friends was that the show turned the focus on its head.
None of the characters in the series were defined by profession, but by personality, and this was reflected in friendships.
The show was humorously played by Joey and Chandler hugging or watching football with their TV chairs, and Ross often missed Rachel, and it was clear that the men were able to relate to this, even though they did not hold back from feeling fully.
One volunteer explained this to me: "As I listen to depressed and suicidal people, it has become clear to me how much even the smallest reactions of friends can mean.
Men who contact us often cannot talk to their friends.
The traditional idea that men should do well is strong, and a man is easily considered weak if he talks about his problems."
"Frendit is one of the series that presents long-term survival mechanisms.
In the series, the small moments of friendship between men were highlighted.
Through the phone, I can offer help from outside in a moment of despair, but long-term support comes from close friends and family."
In honor of Comedy Central's FriendsFest, the set has been revived, so if you're going to attend the event this weekend, you should take your friends to Central Perk for coffee.
Or do something even better, smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks.
You never know how important a friendship it can be.
Comedy Central broadcasts the whole Friends series - all 236 episodes - in honor of #FriendsFest
Di Maria's hit helped PSG defeat Malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan after scoring a goal against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored in his Champions League debut and helped PSG beat Swedish team Malmo on Tuesday.
Read the game report and estimate.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were in the attack when Paris Saint-Germain started working in the Champions League by beating Malmö at Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored after less than four minutes of debut play, strengthening the position of French champions as soon as she shook hands, but PSG screwed up several goals before finally being able to increase their lead: Cavani painted after 60 minutes of play.
The A-block also includes Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish champion. PSG is not only looking for an extension in the playoffs, but also wants to improve its position for the quarterfinals in the three remaining matches.
Even though the SPG scored, the match was not a perfect show for Laurent Blanc's team. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the goal seat and the man was replaced by his former home club, where the man started his amazing career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or in the league of champions, so a 2-0 win and a good touch will give us a good basis, even though we still have something to improve on the season," Blanc said.
"This is good news.
We were thirsty for victory and we were able to do it, but I'm sorry we couldn't do one or two more goals."
Ibrahimovic returned to the team after the injury, and this weekend the team had to settle for a 2-2 tie against Bordeaux in the Ligue 1 series, but Di Maria overshadowed Ibrahimovic at four minutes.
Last month, an Argentinian pier that moved from Manchester United to PSG was named a PSG solver, which will raise the team to a new level in Europe, proving himself worthy of being appointed to run the ball from Marco Verratt's pitch past Malmö's defense and then fired an accurate shot at the rear corner of the goal past Johan Wiland.
But those who looked forward to PSG's crushing victory were disappointed.
Malmö defeated Celtic in the playoffs, marched nine international-level players to the field from the start, and the team playing with the tactics of five men's defense and two attackers was difficult to win.
Nikola Djurdjic's shot barely missed Kevin Trapp's goal post at the 34th minute of the game. The team did not attack very actively.
Instead, PSG gave in to unnecessary pitching and weak finishing, not least Ibrahimovic, who lost five goals in the first half alone. At the beginning of the second half, Ibrahimovic's kick fed the goal to the backseats of Cavani.
However, Ibrahimovic showed his claws in the feed game, and at Ibrahimovic's pitch, Di Maria fired a spiral kick past Wiland at 52 minutes.
The second goal was created in the count's time thanks to Cavan, who was six years old and shot a full hit when Ibrahimovic fed him the left winger from Maxwell's kick.
Malmö's catch ended in another goal, and only the shot from Wiland's top fighter David Luiz at close range was controlled, and Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal from the bench was rejected at the very end.
Malmö's pilot Åge Hareide later admitted that PSG was in its own class. "We played the last Champions League game in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, where the level is not the same.
It's not enough.
A sensation for Parisians.
This was their top match."
Glencore collects $2.5 billion with share issue
Swiss mine giant Glencore, which was hit by lower raw material prices, raised $2.5 billion in Wednesday's share issue as part of his debt reduction strategy.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a statement that he had sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to reduce debts.
The company's market value decreased by 57 per cent this year, wrestling with the fall in raw material prices, as the Chinese economy's recession is hampering demand and putting a strain on the market.
With the share issue, Glencore's share price reached the top of the London stock exchange on Wednesday morning.
The share rose by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence in the FTSE 100 index, which opened to a 0.69 per cent increase.
Glencore announced last week his plans to raise $2.5 billion from the share issue as part of a strategy to reduce its $30 billion debt by a third.
The company sold new shareholders for 125 cents, which is 2.4 per cent down on Tuesday's closing price.
The company issued 1.3 billion shares with a total value of as much as 9.99 per cent of the group.
Concern over the continued recession in China has caused iron ore prices to fall by half, while coal, copper and other commodities have dropped by 20-40%.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
The White House communication on Tuesday confirms that China's President Xi Jinping will travel to the United States for a state visit at the end of the month.
Xi Jinping arrives for his first official visit to Washington on September 25, a return visit after President Barack Obama visited Beijing last November.
After the bilateral talks between the heads of state and the president's wife, Michelle Obama, will host dinners for Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liyuan, in honor of the state visit.
"President Xi Jinping's visit will provide an opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a wide range of global, regional and bilateral issues of mutual interest, while President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping will have the opportunity to engage in constructive discussions on issues on which there are disagreements", the White House's communication states.
Xi Jinping's visit was announced for the first time in February and is expected to visit Seattle to meet several U.S. tech leaders, from Seattle to continue the presidential journey to Washington and from there to New York to the UN General Assembly on 28 September.
Obama and Xi are expected to raise a number of controversial issues, such as Washington's concern about China's alleged cyber espionage and the country's increased activity in controversial waters in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon minimizes diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon had a heated conversation with African-American Effie Brown, saying diversity is not needed behind the camera.
During the HBO Project Greenlight episode on Sunday night, Brown was interrupted by an experienced actor who explained how important it is to take into account the different views of the black protagonist in the project's chosen script.
"The diversity is taken into account in the casting of the film, not in the casting of the programme," Damon claimed.
Brown burst, dismayed and hurt by the claim, "Wow, that's clear," she said, after Damon's comment that starred alone on Mars.
Damon and Brown were gathered with other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly brothers to discuss the finalists of the race.
"Whoever the director is, I would like to encourage you to think about how Harmony's character will be presented," Brown said in the beginning.
"The only black character is a prostitute who has sex with her white pimp."
Dear White People producer supported Leo Angelo and Kristen Brancaccio as film directors, Damon harshly replied that the choice of two could lead to an unwanted outcome.
When the conversation was on television, the social media exploded from Damon's disapproving comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the scene in plain terms: "The fact that Matt Damon is talking to the only black person to explain what diversity is is so white that it hurts."
The tweet was distributed more than 5,000 times, and it was liked 4,000 times.
Damon's comments coincide with a time when the balanced representation of human races in the media is a top topic.
After teenage Michael Brown died from a white police bullet in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement received support across the country, seeking to stop discriminatory treatment against lawmakers and officials.
In February, singer Prince referred to the movement when presenting the album candidates of the year at the Grammy gala.
"Albums still matter," he said.
"Just like books and the lives of black people, albums still matter."
Recently, the Black Lives Matter published a statement in response to the question of Elisabeth Hasselbeck in Fowl News about whether the group should be described as a hate group.
"Black Lives Matter is a group based on love," said the management of the movement.
Damon is one of the entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to the Pope to discuss the Catholic Church's image in the West.
It is not known whether Damon has responded yes to the invitation.
The first winner in the American Ninja Warrior series
Professional climber and vessel collector Isaac Caldiero took the first American Ninja Warrior title on Monday and signed for a $1 million victory.
For the first time all the tasks assigned were cleared in the seventh season that has just ended in the TV series.
In the last episode of the season, Caldiero and photographer Geoff Britten survived the final round.
In the last task, men had to climb up 23 metres of rope in 30 seconds.
Britten solved the task in the first time given, the first competitor to have successfully completed the fourth stage of the American Ninja Warrior competition, but Caldiero did it three seconds faster and won.
After a tough fight, Caldiero told E!News he was still in shock after taking a $1 million pot.
"The win is incredible, because I've never made more than $10,000 a year," he said in an interview with E! about his jackpot.
"Suddenly, I can't even imagine the consequences of this, the future is wide open."
Responsible producer Kent Weed talked to The Hollywood Reporter about the finals and why Britten won't be rewarded, even though he was the first competitor to solve all the tasks.
According to the rules, the fastest wins the prize money.
If more competitors find out all the tasks, the fastest wins," Weed explained.
"Of course, the money prize is great and will revolutionise life, but Britten also gets satisfaction from its performance.
I don't think he's going to stay here for more than that.
He's just happy with his performance.
He has received plenty of praise from fans.
Britten is a great guy, and family is important to him.
His children and his wife think he's a hero.
Geoff told me that since he did not win himself, he preferred to win for Isaac.
He also believes Isaac would have felt the same way about him if the situation had been different."
America Ninja Warrior renewed for the eighth season, the shoot of which will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers squeezed the victory over Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- Detroit Tigers does not have particularly pleasant experiences in the second half of the season.
Tigers, one of baseball's best teams, is now in the final place of the American League Central.
But the team succeeded on Tuesday by hitting the Minnesota Twins on Target Field.
Twins lost his chance to get to Houston Astros to fight for another wild card spot in the playoffs.
Detroit returned, even for just one night, to a taste of victory, which has been behind a rock in the second half of the season.
"Every victory is nice, however it is achieved," Tigers pilot Brad Ausmus said.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon stood up when Detroit succeeded three times in the first two innings, once in the sixth and once again in the ninth inning.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 shifts in a good game and released three runs.
He's only had three good beginnings on nine outdoor shifts.
"I just want to end the season strongly this year," Simon said.
"It's hard for an alternative player to throw every game, and that's why I want to pitch until the sixth shift."
Tigers pitcher replacement Victor Martinez got three hits and hit two runs that were his first hit run since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-shot night since he got four hits against Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He hit well," Ausmus said.
"She looks good in batting practice and kept her pace in the game."
In the second shift of the seventh inning, Twins had the best chance of getting back into the game.
The mid-coop Byron Buxton started the shift with a two-chamber hit close to the left sideline.
A real skipper, Aaron Hicks, hit a sacrifice, and Simon took second Brian Dozier, who took three straight assists before he was replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Herdy got a free pass for Mauer, a rookie pitcher's substitute hit by Miguel Sano, followed by a right-handed Drew VerHagen.
When there were two runners in the field, VerHagen got the third Trevor Plouffen to burn two players.
Major League led the 27th time this season when Plouffe burned two players.
After Detroit beat the certification run in the first shift of the ninth shift, Tigers' finalist Bruce Rondon hit two runs, and the score was 5-4.
However, the right-handed pitcher threw three straight passes and was able to hold his team's position.
Detroit took advantage of the fact that Phil Hughes was a bit rusty.
Tigers got three runs in the first two innings against a right-handed old man who had just got back from the injury list in the fields, and he was on the sidelines for a month because of the back infection.
"Of course, the beginning wasn't what I would have hoped for, but as the game progressed, I began to feel more comfortable, and I was able to do a good job and a few good assists in the third inning," Hughes said.
When Hughes got to the lead, he hit the second Ian Kinsler in the first inning.
The real skipper J.D. Martinez's free ride brought Victor Martinez the first race of the game.
Victor Martinez's 0/21 streak was cut when the team had players on the bench.
The third Nick Castellanos was next hit by one nest, one run, but Victor Martinez was burned trying to move on to three.
Tigers increased his lead in the second inning, catcher James McCann survived the hit to second base and Anthony Gose to first base, when the score was 3-0.
"That's quite a hit," said Twins coach Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit very well, but the punch hit the right spot."
The pitch was Hughes, who fed a score-free third inning, after which he was replaced with a right-handed substitute for A.J. Achter.
Hughes's balance was three runs, six hits, a free bale and four straight passes.
Significant: Tigers' right-handed hitter Anibal Sanchez wasn't in the lineup because of a tear in the batting shoulder.
The shoulder is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of injured persons due to a shoulder tear since mid-August, and he was supposed to be on Wednesday.
When Sanchez doesn't play, left-handed hitter Daniel Norris leaves the list of injured persons and is part of the starting line-up against Twins.
Norris has been in 1-1 in four games since he was replaced with his left-handed hitter David Price on 30 July.
He has been out of the lineup since August 20, due to a rupture of the crooked abs.
Tigers and Twins finish their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, running average: 4.43) receives Ervin Santana (5-4, running average: 4.73), a right-handed Minnesota pitcher.
