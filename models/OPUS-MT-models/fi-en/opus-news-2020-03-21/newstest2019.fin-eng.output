Eemeli Kouki led Hurricane home win in the opening - Savo Volley's second win
After seven consecutive men's volleyball Championship medals, Hurricane-Loimaa began the season with a 2018-19 home win, when Raisio's Loi fell 3-0 on Saturday.
Eemeli Kouki, a general player who returned to Finland from Romania, was 22 points the most effective Hurricane.
There were some tunes abroad, but they didn't happen, and then a call came from Loimaa.
It was pretty quick to settle things, Kouki said.
Like Kouk, Tomi Drumunen, who played in Loimä, supported Kouk with 18 points.
The most effective among the guests was the national team chipper Samuli Kaislasalo with 17 points.
The win of the opening game is always important.
Many players had experience from the other side, too, and it brought extra edge to the game.
Our game is not yet finished, but continuing the medal tube is, of course, the goal," Kouki said.
Määtttänen Savo Volley's most effective
Miro Määttänen was the most effective of Savo Volley's 18 points when the team knocked over the Ducks 3-0 to Vantaa by Vieremä.
Our game was volatile, especially in the attack head, but luckily we were able to squeeze the victory.
At least I didn't have any conscious different downloads when I played against my former team, Määttanen said.
In Vieremä Volleyball 3 series, Antti Siltala, who started his career in 2000-01, scored 12 points.
Chief coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with many things.
The hall was small, the atmosphere on the ceiling all the time.
The home opening left a good feeling.
Miro was the king, Silli also played a good game, Tuovinen said.
Siltala's previous season in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver in Pielavesi Sammo, even when Tuovinen was the head coach.
Thiago Maciel was the most effective in Ducks at 14 points.
Mikkone's star again Akaa-Volley
During the 2012-13 season, Joni Mikkonen, who has won the league's scoring spot, has started this season strongly.
The chipper scored 25 points when Akaa-Volley took his season's opening win after knocking down Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has started well for itself.
Of course, today was close to defeat, as we were in the fourth round of defeat 17-21.
A round win was dug, and the fifth round came at the same time," Mikkonen said.
A few seasons ago, the most effective Tigers in the finals had scored 28 points by the chipper Edwards Builders.
Countryman Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs supported by 17 points.
We didn't get much hold of the guy's chipper, Mikkonen said.
Finland in comparison of human capital number one in the world
Finland is the world leader in the comparison of human capital, says the science magazine Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
During the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was the number one in the statistics.
In 2016, the top five was almost the same as in 1990.
Earlier, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, Holland was higher than one and Taiwan was found on the list instead of Canada.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan were worst placed in the comparison.
When measuring human capital, the level of education, access to education, skills and health of the population is examined.
The World Bank has aligned human capital with economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico in check, the local game ended with no goal
Real Madrid goaltender Thibaut Courtois stretched to a great fight, and the local game of Madrid teams ended in a goalless draw late Saturday in the Spanish football league.
Atletico from Madrid, Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were closest to the goal, but Belgian watchman Courtois was able to fight.
Courtois played three seasons in Atletico when he was a Chelsea player.
In the beginning of the week, Fifa, the International Football Federation, chose him to be the goalkeeper of the year.
In Real, Gareth Bale scored the best goal, but his shot was directed past the end of the goal opening half.
After the break, Bale got changed because of a thigh injury.
According to ESPN, disillusioned fans of Real shouted the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, who moved to Juventus.
The United States is now under attack against the right to abortion - A powerful documentary tells why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to determine whether one of the nine Supreme Court members could be elected as President Donald Trump's nominated candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
Many in the Republican Party hope that Kavanaugh's decisive vote will reverse the decision known as Roe v. Wade, which made abortion legal in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary Reversing Roe - the United States and abortion rights tell how the current situation has come about over the years.
As incredible as it may seem, the topic is topical also in Finland.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (Sin) has done publicity work against safe abortion and has received support from the majority of national MPs from different degrees.
At the beginning of a powerful documentary, gynaecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has been the only abortion doctor in Missouri due to law tightening.
The clinic's armed guard says he's defending U.S. religious freedom.
News videos remind the clinics of deadly terrorist attacks.
Let's move on to the time when the abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, a association of Lutheran churchmen guided women to reliable abortion doctors.
The interviewed pastor's arguments are good, but in fact they are not even needed, a photograph of the woman who died of the self-inflicted abortion is enough.
There were about 5,000 deaths in the United States every year.
In particular, the Republican Party defended the legalisation of abortions.
Already in 1967 in California, Governor Ronald Reagan signed the abortion justice law.
Later, it was Reagan, in his presidential campaign in 1980, who began to mix religion with politics to catch voters.
His abortion position was also rotated by his successor George Bush Senior.
And Donald Trump did the same.
The documentary reaches the deepest point of the matter in its search for a reason for the politicisation of the abortion issue.
When religious organisations supporting racial segregation were denied a tax exemption, they became politically active.
An abortion was chosen as a stick horse.
Religion has brought exceptional ties to politics.
When writing this, the U.S. is in a situation where the president, who boasted of his sexual harassment, but who caught the voices of the religious right with an abortion attitude, has chosen Kavanaugh as the Supreme Court candidate, who is now accused of sexual harassment by many women.
Kavanaugh can have the power to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls based on the status of scales.
The Israeli army shot seven Palestinians, including two children - large demonstrations at the border
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months after Israel has fired on protesters in the border zone.
Israel's soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza border zone on Friday, says the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
Two children are among the dead, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health: boys aged 12 and 14.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
Of these, 89 were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and made an air strike to the border zone as protesters threw stones and explosives at Israeli troops.
The army says it has begun using force so that protesters don't break down the border fence or try to cross it.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in the Gaza demonstrations since March, when the Palestinians started the weekly demonstrations on the border.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, there are 12,000 wounded.
The protesters called for access to Palestinian families in areas where the Palestinians had to leave when the State of Israel was founded in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
The explosives dropped on kites and helium balls from the Palestinian side have ignited forest areas and farmland in Israel.
Teemu Santa got a penalty kick - he couldn't shoot himself
Wigan's top Chey Dunkley seemed to have knocked him down with a tackle from behind in the penalty area.
Judge Gavin Ward allowed the game to continue.
According to his interpretation, the tackle was clean.
Teemu Santa couldn't believe his eyes.
The situation may have been a problem for Judge Ward, who sentenced Norwich to a penalty kick at the 85th minute when Santa was knocked down.
Ward showed me a penalty spot, and Mario Vranc hit a 1-0 win goal.
Santa has scored five goals for Norwich in the Championship series.
The last one was born last Saturday with a stylish chest muscle against QPR.
The work had a taste for Santa again.
After losing the ball, he continued the situation to the end.
He created goals and defended them tirelessly.
For Norwich, the match was the fifth in two weeks.
The team will continue in the league cup.
There are five wins in the back.
Pedophiles' help service was immediately filled with reservations - about 40,000 people in Finland have an interest in children
It is estimated that two per cent of men and a small percentage of women have at least some sexual interest in the pre-school age.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
So far, it has been difficult for those who are sexually interested in children or young people to get help.
SeriE, a joint project between the Criminal Service Support Foundation and Sexpo, trains professionals to meet paedophiles as customers and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, an email flood and meeting times were set up very quickly in Sexpo, offering advice and therapy, says Yle.
However, these are promised to be released during the autumn.
The sexual preference for children is a source of shame to many.
Most of those who observe paedophile feelings in themselves have not carried out their fantasies and thus did nothing criminal.
However, a preference is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that distress them and discourage them.
They also complicate normal life, says Yle's sexual therapist Patricia Thesleff, who is a specialist in the project.
I think the work is valuable if even one child is spared sexual violence, Thesleff says.
Chore leaders or Congo gynecologist?
As the winner of the US President Donald Trump Nobel Peace Prize, the idea may sound out of hand, but, based on the betting odds, Trump is one of the biggest favourites to win the prize.
The background is Trump's role in getting North Korea at least on the level of speech to commit to nuclear disarmament.
Based on the odds, the biggest favourites for the Nobel Peace laureates are South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have already met three times this year and promised to seek a peace agreement between their countries.
Warming between the poles is significant, as the gap was still chilly last year.
Still, the reward of Kim, who has spent years threatening his country with nuclear weapons and with an iron grip, would undoubtedly also be a source of criticism.
The Nobel Prize winners will be announced from Monday onwards, and Friday will be the most prominent, the Peace Prize.
If the prize is not awarded to those involved in Korean peninsula diplomacy, one of the top candidates is Congo's doctor Denis Mukwege.
A respected gynecologist has treated thousands of women victims of mass rape in his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has become a leading expert in his field in the world.
Mukwege has drawn attention to sexual violence, which is a creepy by-product of many conflicts.
The UN refugee organisation, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been considered a strong candidate.
The Nobel Committee has said that there are 331 candidates for the award this year.
The names of the candidates will not be made public.
Trump himself wouldn't mind if he had the Nobel Prize.
In May, a reporter asked him at the White House if he felt he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it myself, Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, the President continued with reference to the North Korea talks.
But there are things that make Trump's Nobel Prize unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which will decide on the award, has often acknowledged the people and organisations that represent liberal democracy and a multi-polar world order - the very kind of international cooperation that Trump has been seen as an opponent.
In the 21st century, three U.S. politicians have won the prize, all of whom have been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
So to reward Trump would require an ideological roundabout from the Nobel Committee.
Fire report in the tunnel: Motorists behaved like lemmings and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos in Lohja, the 1st Street, happened on September 8th.
The traffic in the tunnel area was cut off because of the announcement to both Turku and Helsinki.
When it was discovered that this was a system failure, the fire department tried to make traffic normal.
But it didn't work very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Centre said it couldn't be opened, because there are also car drivers in the road and they're driving as it should, Pasi Kääriäinen, on-call fire master, told STT freshly at that time.
At the time, the motorway was driven even in the wrong direction just after waiting.
When the first begins to act against traffic rules, some others often follow, Tapio Heiskanen, the contact manager of Traffic Security, is amazed.
According to the traffic rules, motorways and tunnels are not allowed to stop for anything other than a compelling reason.
Traffic security points out that in exceptional circumstances, you cannot risk traffic with hasty solutions.
Emergency vehicles must always be allowed to travel as unobstructed as possible.
Driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is especially forbidden, as is making a U-turn and cancelling.
The same prohibitions also apply in tunnels, where you always have to turn on the headlights.
Stopping without compelling reason is also forbidden, as is of course parking.
In the past, there have even been cases where the driver has stopped in the tunnel to brush the snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and the time for this kind of action, Heiskanen says in the traffic safety statement.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their celebrations, even though the ship was caught in the bottom of the lake
Ilves fans carried by inland waterway ship M/S Tampere would have liked to stay on the ship to continue their victory party, even though the ship had been caught in the bottom of the lake by its bow, says Juho Syrjä, who was the ship's master at the time.
M/S Tampere, who was on his way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drifted off the route late Saturday night and was caught in the bottom in Vanajavesi in Akaa.
The 19 passengers and five crew members on board were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one was injured in the field.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their celebrations on the ship until morning, but of course it made more sense to send them on a fire department ride to the harbour and by bus home," Syrja said to STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna to watch the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended in Ilves' 4-3 victory.
According to Syrjä, Saturday's haveh was due to the fact that the water level in Vanajavesi was about half a meter lower than normal.
According to Syrjä, navigation was also made more difficult by the fact that the nearest bus sign was covered in the debris, which is why its reflectors were not normally visible in the dark autumn bridge.
No more than a collision
Haveri took place on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalmi, shortly after the shipping route had submerged the motorway bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
According to Syrjä, there was no greater drama, as the ship's speed at the time of the incident was very low and the impact on the bottom did not cause a more significant collision.
According to Syrjä, getting caught at the bottom has not caused any leaks or pressure on the ship, and the ship's cruises continue normally.
The diver came to check the condition of the ship on Saturday morning before the ship was towed off the shallow.
To be sure, we will still go to the yard to check that this did not cause any damage, says Syrjä.
Syrjä believes that the next M/S Tampere cruise booked next weekend can be arranged.
According to him, the ship's cruise season will continue until Independence Day.
No use for ambulances
The rescue department received an alarm about the incident on Saturday evening shortly after 9:30.
Ambulances were called to the port of Viila to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
late in the evening, fire master Matti Willman said that the conditions for evacuation at the lake were difficult because of the darkness and the fairly loud wind.
After 2:30, the Pirkanmaa Rescue Department announced on the night before Sunday that everyone on board had been evacuated and the passengers had been moved by bus to Tampere.
The cruiser, built in 1957, has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump's judge candidate for harassment and drinking may be out of a top position
Brett Kavanaugh, who was presented as a Supreme Court judge in the United States, may well be missing the post he is seeking, says programme director Mika Aaltola from the Institute for Foreign Policy.
So far at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour during his studies.
According to Aaltola, the suspicions have put so much political pressure on the Republican party that President Donald Trump may end up posing as someone else.
On occasion in the United States, it has happened before that the presidential candidate for the Supreme Court has raised a lot of conflicts.
In this case, the candidate for the judge has usually retreated himself, says Aaltola.
This has enabled the president to keep his face.
The appointment would rain on the Democratic laar
The U.S. Supreme Court is trying to be above politics, but, at least in the case of Kavanaugh, the election of a new judge has become a very politically sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, according to Aaltola, the decision will probably rain on the Democratic Party's laarie in the upcoming congressional elections.
It would increase the enthusiasm for voting among young people and women, who would be more likely to vote for the Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-time victory for Republicans.
The appointment does not take place for every presidency, since in the United States the Supreme Court judges are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request at the age of 70 to 80.
Some Republicans also hesitated to be called
The US Supreme Court judges will normally be given a background check, says Aaltola.
Although Trump has only set a week deadline for further clarification by the FBI, Aaltola says it can bring up something essential.
It might.
Rarely is smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, at least it is certain that Kavanaugh's suitability or incompatibility for office will still be discussed livelyly before the Senate makes its decision.
Republicans have a majority in the Senate by 51-49 votes, but at least two female Republicans are thought to be suspicious of Kavanaugh's appointment.
The most embarrassing thing would be that the nomination would be put to the vote and the Republicans would disappear.
Woman identified Salisbury suspect as a military intelligence agent
A Russian woman has told the BBC that she recognizes a Russian man suspected of being poisoned by Salisbury as an agent of Russian military intelligence.
Based on the photos, she said it was Anatoli Tshepiga, who works for military intelligence GRU.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia said earlier they revealed one of the men suspected of poisoning as Tshepiga.
Earlier, they said they had found evidence that the men's current identities were aliases.
The BBC group travelled to a village near the Russian-China border, where Tshepiga grew up.
The woman living in the village recognized young Tshepigan Bellingcat from the pictures published.
He identified the same man from the pictures of British police, a man now calling himself Ruslan Boshirov.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Scripel and his daughter with Novitshok neurotoxin in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been awarded, among other things, with the Russian hero's medal in 2014.
Russia still denies the suspected GRU connection.
Earlier in September, men suspected of poisoning said in an interview with Russian television that they were tourists in Salisbury.
Old people in throwing bags in the reform of the social security system
Now there is a living example of what the change limit for the reform of the social security system, as defined by Sipilä's government, means in practice.
My municipality Vaala's social services are produced by Oulunkaare municipal association, whose former regional director of health services has been elected in 2016 attendo.
The leaders of the municipal association warn the council of the change limiter.
If social spending now rises, the municipality's state aids will be cut in the future.
The city centre decision-makers were frightened, and most of them are ready for a major restructuring of the care of the elderly, which would end the institutional care of the health centre's annual department and a small unit of the memory sick.
Home care would be increased, which means that elderly people living in remote villages will be torn from their roots to be "home" treated.
Attendo trusted that the municipality would pay customers.
Vaala's left didn't swallow bad preparation, but organised a good audience event with a lot of relatives, carers and also delegates from other parties.
I introduced the social welfare preparation slides, how in Vaala municipality the most care for elderly people is already at home in the whole of North Ostrobothnia.
Carina Läntinen, a neighbourly councilman, was also involved.
The local newspaper did a big story about the opportunity, and it raised Oulunkaaren proponents to their hind legs.
Sote preparers do not write on any papers that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Vaala, which is now waiting empty for residents.
There are no other service providers.
Preparatorys only talk about service vouchers, but they don't tell what level of care they get or what kind of staff structure Attendo will take care of the elderly until hospice care.
Without a nurse?
In fact, the facilities at the health centre will be discontinued because there is no doctor's night emergency services there.
Attendo will also rely on doctors at Vaala Health Centre.
The example of Vaala shows how downtown officials spin delegates with incomplete information and put their backs against the wall with a change limiter.
This is how the Central Party clears out of the residents of Vaala, because who stays there unsafe voluntarily, if there is an opportunity to move out.
Was it one of the ballots in the centre that the whole country was kept inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan opened a Grand Mosque in Cologne
In Germany, in the city of Cologne, thousands of people were protesting when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who visited the country, opened one of Europe's largest mosques.
Several hundred people had gathered on the river Rhine since the morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read on protesters' signs, and the slogans condemned fascism.
Several demonstrations have been organised during Erdogan's visit on Thursday, and the security measures have been tight.
In Cologne, about 10,000 people were expected to protest against the human rights situation in Turkey, among other things.
Erdogan's supporters had also gathered near the Grand Mosque.
However, the police had isolated a large area from the mosque for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised the success of his visit to Germany and thought it strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
On Friday, Erdogan and Merkel vowed to rebuild their relations, which have deteriorated significantly since the Turkish coup attempt in 2016.
Mrs Merkel stressed, however, that there were deep differences between the countries on issues such as human rights.
Criticism surrounds the visit
Both the mayor of Cologne, Henriette Reker, and the prime minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet, withdrew their participation in the opening, as criticism of Erdogan's visit accelerated.
A 30-year-old student from Turkey, Cansu, said he came to a demonstration against Erdogan from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who cannot go to the streets in Turkey.
They have been arrested, killed and subjected.
For Erdogan, anything different from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the last stage of Erdogan's journey to Germany in Nordrhein-Westfalen, a significant part of the population is of Turkish origin.
In Slovakia, three are charged with the murder of a journalist
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
The prosecutor said on Friday that three people were charged with the murder of Kucik and his fiancee in February and other crimes.
Earlier this week the police arrested eight people in an investigation of the murder, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot in February with his fiancée from his home in Bratislava.
He had studied the connections between politicians and the Italian mob.
Police have suspected the murders were related to Kuciak's investigation.
The case and the article published by Kuciak have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems with Karelian distribution on Sunday in scattered settlements
Due to the fault of printing, Karjalainen will also have to be posted without an address.
This can be seen in the distribution of the magazine in diffused settlement areas, where the distribution of common boxes is carried out from memory.
The situation was the same for Saturday's magazine, and the problem may continue on Monday.
Posting puts extra stacks of magazines in the province.
The newspapers of other Finnish subscribers will not be posted separately until Monday.
The distribution of these magazines will be significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Today, journalist Arto Nyberg is interviewing Vesa Heila, among others, in her upcoming discussion programme.
Vesa is in the studio telling about her upcoming space trip she booked from Virgin Galactica already in 2010.
The price was €151,000, which required a bank loan to pay.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the departure date has been postponed year after year.
Now it seems that after an unfortunate test flight in 2014, which claimed the death penalty, things are going well.
If everything goes well, commercial flights will start again this year or at the latest next year.
Vesa's flight number is 300, which means his journey is about a year from the first departure.
The flight lasts 2.5 hours and the weightless space is 5 minutes at 100 km, a Finnish astronaut tells about the future on his website.
At the same address, he also has a background in his longing for space.
When I was a kid, I read a comic book called Space Travel and saw Star Trek on television.
Star wars have been seen, and that's where the idea was smoldering...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a harsh host
Manchester City continued its lossless run in the Champion League, as it knocked down Brighton's 2-0 home field on Saturday.
Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero are the winners of the sixth win of the reigning champion team's season.
Sterling was allowed to direct his fourth shot of the season from close range to an empty goal when Leroy Sané found him 30 minutes from Brighton's goal post.
Agüero raised his own goal balance to five when he and Sterling saw Brighton's defense to pieces in 65 minutes.
The Argentinean was able to easily place the 2-0 final readings on the penalty spot.
With six wins and one draw, the season-starting City will lead the Champion League with 19 points.
However, Liverpool, who played less than one match, is only one point away.
On Saturday night, Liverpool will face a series three Chelsea in its own seventh round match.
New decision-makers were selected by youth clubs in Joensuu
At a meeting that ended on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Associations chose new decision-makers for their next three-year term for the years 2019-2021.
Anu Sivonen from Ylä-Savo and Petra Mäkeläinen from Häme were elected president.
The council elected 40 actual members and 40 alternate members, the Finnish Youth Associations announce on Sunday.
The youth club meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural hobby activities to be known for their quality and safety.
The youth club meeting in Joensuu makes three promises in its three-year goals: We keep the doors open for everyone, and we organise equal activities regardless of the place of residence and background, and we support voluntary activities and people on their own growth paths, says the Finnish Youth clubs in their statement.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkö and was amazed at Ferrari: "He's losing a very important driver"
In an interview with Swiss magazine Blick, the British driver of the Mercedes was asked if he believed that the release of Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari's services would help Hamilton in the rest of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second driver Sebastian Vettel with 40 points at the World Championship points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari said that Räikkönen will not continue in the stable next season, while Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Of course, Hamilton does not believe that Räikkönen would hit gloves on the counter.
I don't think Kimi will change in the remaining games.
He is an exceptional professional - a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favourite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Hamilton has said earlier that Räikkönen has been one of his examples.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and I was dreaming about Formula One, I played F1 all day on PlayStation.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season will continue on Sunday at the Russian round.
At 2 pm, Valtteri Bottas from Mercedes leaves from the pole.
The Iltalehti follows the race from the moment to the moment.
Football's A-Youth Championship Championship struggle became a total farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players
The top league level of the football boys will end on Saturday, when the final round of the season will be played.
Before the 1 pm round, the starting points for the championship struggle were clear: FC Lahti Academy is practically enough to score a point against Vasa IFK.
In order to change the situation in the final round, Ilves, who is the second in the championship battle, must win PK-35 and hope to defeat the Gulf.
However, the Lahti national championship was practically confirmed even before the start whistle, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one less hammer, the match could not have been started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
At the break, the Lahtiers led 7-0.
One of the reasons why the stakers are missing is that the team has played part of the A-youth SM series, the P20 series, and the men's Two-Stack C.
Vasa IFK has played in Kakkonen practically against the fall of the season.
In the final round on Saturday, Vasa IFK will be forced to win the JBK in the guest match and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose its own guest match against KuFu in Toivala, Lake Siilin.
The car ended up on its roof in Eno - according to the rescue department, luck was involved
The passenger car drifted out of the road and ended up on its roof in Eno's case safety on Sunday around 9 o'clock.
Four persons were involved in the accident.
Two of them were slightly injured, the rescue department reported.
There was good luck, the statement states.
According to the rescue department, the road was wet after rain.
The police patrol was at the scene of the accident.
Supo expects new ways of intelligence: Equipment procurements and recruitments already made, there is no silence about planning operations abroad
According to Supo's chief Antti Pelttar, the intelligence law has been prepared by purchasing equipment and training staff.
With the entry into force of the intelligence laws, a permanent increase of about €10 million would be added to the budget of the capo.
The protection police (supon) premises in Ratakakatu, Helsinki, are already preparing fully for the entry into force of the intelligence laws.
Antti Peltari, the Constituent Chief of Supo, tells Western Media that there have already been equipment purchases for future intelligence powers.
Serena Williams is startled by a video of her singing in topless - campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer
Tennis superstar Serena Williams is turning on again.
Now he's campaigning to raise awareness about breast cancer by publishing a video on his Instagram account, where he sings just his hands in front of his breasts, reports AFP.
The song is a 1991 hit by the Australian, The Divinyls, I Touch Myself.
By video, Williams supports the Australian breast cancer association's operations.
"I voted for The Divinyls' global hit to remind women to carry out regular self-checks [chests]," Williams writes in his Instagram message.
And yes, this set me in the area of discomfort, but I wanted to do it because the subject affects all women regardless of the color of the skin around the world.
Early detection is everything a and o - it scares many lives.
The Divinyls song is written by Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which is made in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
"He died of breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first," Williams said.
The video has now been watched 1.5 million times.
It was published early on Sunday morning.
In the video's comments, Williams is praised for his courage.
Williams dropped out of Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
There is a stir in the background in the US open tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams became angry with the chief judge of the match, claiming, among other things, that men are accepted for far more violent behaviour than women players.
Chinese restaurant on a mountain path is not suitable for high-feared people
In addition to traditional Chinese delicacies, the restaurant serves great scenery.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in Zhejiang province in China.
It is literally located on the cliff.
You can look at the forest below if you want.
Rotten landscapes in high altitudes make restaurant guests yawn their breath in the mountains of Longquan.
To get to the restaurant, you need to hike among the peach trees.
The restaurant opened to hikers on 19.9.2018.
The comments about Youtube wonder where the restaurant's toilet is located.
Hiking to a restaurant requires good condition, the place is told.
Korpela's alley run ends today: That's how it all ends
All good things will end in time.
Today, that's what happens to Finnish country drama, the Korpela alley run, which has been quite liked.
The third season has gone like hot rocks: last week, the episode was watched by 722,000 Finns as a first performance on television.
The peaks in themselves are no longer of any practical significance, as Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkinen are not going to continue.
In the final episode, the relationship between Charlie and Mirku will take another big leap forward, and I think his mother will be the first to guess what's coming.
The relationship between Anssi and Misa is warm, and in the light of recent events, it's romantic, but then again, Laiho appears in the picture.
Even the police are skeptical about a man's slyness.
However, no one can predict the fate of Laiho in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, will hear incredible news.
The last will of the distance will be revealed, which will put a woman on the brink of tears.
In a week's time, the Sunday evenings will resume in Sorjonen.
Korpela's alley run today on TV1 at 9:05 pm.
Is it worth going to work tomorrow with a little cold?
Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
A lot of lottery tickets, whether to stay home or not.
However, it is worth thinking about whether others should be infected, as the disease can be contagious even if their own symptoms are small.
Sometimes the symptoms of the flu strike suddenly, sometimes they show up creeping.
In the latter option, you may be infecting others already, even if your symptoms seem small, says Prevention.
So is it worth staying home?
According to the Prevention, the flu is contagious even when the person himself has no symptoms.
The virus is transmitted already a day before the symptoms begin and then from five days to a week.
Children may infect the disease longer.
As soon as you recognise the symptoms, you should not be in school or at work.
You can return to work when your cough eases and there is no fever anymore, says Professor of Medicine Gregory Poland.
You should also avoid training.
Too fast to return to the gym will slow the recovery.
Also, remember to wash your hands, blow on a tissue and throw your snot paper in the trash.
Sore to move, though?
If you have to leave the home when you are ill, consider wearing a mask.
The mask does not control the viruses, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
Then you don't put your fingers in your nose or mouth, Poland says.
The sneezing is also limited with the mask.
How, then, can you avoid infections?
The best way is still to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, it is difficult to avoid the latter.
For example, in the United States, an average person touches his eyes, nose or mouth every 15 to 30 seconds, Poland warns.
The new Miss Finland repeats the beauty tradition: "My husband is a hockey player"
The hockey player and the Miss are often linked.
This also happened with Alina Voronkova, 23.
Alina Voronkova, who is from Pertunmaa, has become her welter of the 2018 Miss Finland crown.
Beauty now lives in Lahti, where she moved at 15 years of age.
Alina's mother is Inkerinsuomalainen and the father is Russian.
From father's Russianness, Voronkov was bullied at school.
Mother and Father have moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied for being Russian.
In Pertunmaa, I didn't have any friends at all, Alina says at the announcement of the semi-finalists at the Miss Suomi competition.
After secondary school, Alina decided to start clean and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon the beauty found new friends, and the everyday life began to roll as desired.
At the age of 15, you think you're an adult, but I really wasn't.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner Joonas Hurr, who is familiar with Pelicans.
After a career in the Finnish Championship, a hockey player has played abroad, like in Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was on the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Championships.
In the early days of dating, the couple lived in a distance of almost a year, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could get into the winning trio and get a career with it, I don't want to believe it would have any effect on our relationship.
Even if we have to live apart, we have good trust and the good thing about a distance relationship is that it's a spark that keeps up with us all the time, Alina grins in May.
With continued growth with joy, death on our heels
Almost everyone is concerned about the earth's resilience.
Still, it's nothing you want to give up.
Sustainable options are being sought for continued growth, but the theory of moderate economy also encounters major problems.
In a few generations, continued economic growth has brought ordinary people, especially in the northern Hemisphere, a standard of living that could only be dreamed of.
However, the long-standing overhanging of the Earth's carrying capacity and climate change cause this market economy's rock leg to waver in a threatening way.
Two men were stabbed on the night against Sunday in Kannelmäki at Sitratori at four o'clock in the morning.
The man who was born in 1986 was seriously injured in the stabbing and the second one, who was born in 1968, was milder.
The older men have already been released from the hospital.
The police have caught one person whose possible part of the stabbing is being investigated.
Police are also looking for another suspect related to the events.
The events are being investigated as attempted killing and aggravated assault.
An important point for IFK Mariehamn - Interin coach regretted the mistake
IFK Mariehamn's Simon Silverholt goal against Inter brought the team an important point in the men's football league on Saturday.
Silverholt finished the match with a 78th minute finish.
Silvelholt got through from the right side and happily lifted the ball over goalie Henrik Moisander.
In the guest saber game, the Maarians reached the difference to the Turku Ball Society on the spot.
An important goal and a valuable point, summed up Mariehamn's head coach Peter Lundberg.
Lundberg said, however, that the team did not get into the kind of fight he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes during the opening season, but luckily the goal of the Turku people brought us stronger into the game.
According to home team Inter's head coach John Allen, the game was under control, but the goal was again painful.
One defense error took away our full spot, Allen lamented.
We were the best again!
Finland has the most human value in the world
Finland has ranked number one in the comparison of 195 countries.
The study measured the health and education of the people.
Finland is the best country in the world, if you measure it with human capital.
Finland was ranked number one in a study that measured the health, education and learning of citizens.
The study measured the change in capital from 1990 to 2016.
The study was published by The Lancet.
According to the summary, human capital has a significant impact on how the national economy can grow in the future.
The most serious situation exists in Africa.
The states in the continent took the seven worst points in comparison.
It's Niger's tail.
STT was the first person to tell the story.
Lehtä showed her underpower skills, the venue is not yet certain
Jori Lehtää's strong underpower play came out as his NHL club Philadelphia Flyers played their last training match before the season began.
Philadelphia beat Boston 4-1, and Lehtähti fed Michael Raffli twice to score.
In the last few days, Lehtä has been on display because of drug suspicions.
MTV said on Wednesday that Lehterä is one of 23 suspects in a drug group where some are suspected of drug use and some are suspected of selling, for example.
Lehtar has denied that he has committed a crime.
The club and the player have discussed the topic, and the NHL is investigating the case.
After the match, Sam Carchidi, a journalist in Philadelphia Inquirer, who closely follows the Flyers, estimated that Lehtää is part of a group of six attackers, five of whom will get a seat in the NHL team.
According to Carchid, Lehtää was excellent in the training match.
In the second round, Lehtää fought the puck for himself with underpower, pulled the defender on him, and fed Raffli, who had been waiting in front of the goal, to the open place.
For the second time, the duo's cooperation scored right at the end of the match.
The Flyers will begin the NHL season on October 4th in a foreign game against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defenseman Urho Vaakanainen is waiting for the team's coaching team to decide whether to join the NHL team.
I thought the training camp was good.
I did my best, and I can be proud of this.
Now the coaches decide if I can play.
I think I'm ready for the NHL, Libraina said in an interview published on Boston's Twitter account.
Librane, who had learned hockey in the riverboys, played against Philadelphia for 19.31 minutes.
With the goal of Boston, Tuukka Rask surrendered four times and rejected 20 times.
Flies-based defenseman Vili Saarijärvi scored a 1-0 goal for Detroit with the upper hand when the team knocked down Toronto 5-1.
In Calgary's ranks, Ilves was raised by defender Juuso Välimäki, but Edmonton defeated Calgary 4-3.
Oilers rested, among other things, Jesse Puljujärvi and goalie Mikko Koski.
Florida's Aleksander Barkov played for over 20 minutes and pitched the goal in a local game against Tampa Bay.
Tampa won 3-2.
Columbus defenseman Markus Nutivaara pitched his team's consolation goal halfway through the final round when Chicago defeated Columbus 4-1.
Joonas Korpisalo rejected 23/27 reels with the goal of the losing.
Already over 180,000 responses to the time survey
The citizens have actively responded to a survey about the decision on Finland's future time.
The question of whether Finland should apply winter or summer time permanently in the future has already gathered over 180,000 answers.
There is still less than a couple of weeks to answer a survey opened in Otasanta.fi.
The respondents are also asked whether Finland should be in the same time as the other Nordic, Baltic, Central Europe or Western Russia.
The latest picture shows the change: The strongest man in the world lost tens of kilos
Eddie Hall, crowned the strongest man in the world in 2017, is undergoing a striking transformation.
British Eddie Hall hunted the title of the strongest man in the world for a long and determined time.
Hall could eat as much as 10,000 kilocalories worth of food a day, and, according to Mirror, weighed 200 kilos at its largest.
The shirts were of size 5XL.
Before the title was won, Hall admitted to doing damage to his body.
The human body has not been created to be of this size, Hall said.
Britt hunted the strongest man in the world with all the means at his disposal, and the family man promised to end his career if he got the title.
Hall didn't want his children to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise, and he was no longer seen at the world's strongest man competition in April.
Only recently, Hall published a picture on Instagram, posing in a much slimmer condition than his active career.
Hall writes its current weight is 169.5 kilos.
Hall wrote that he is now training in aerobics five times a week.
The programme includes boxing, cycling and swimming, among other things.
In addition, Hall performs four exercises a week at the gym.
This year, the most powerful man in the world was the Icelandic, also known from Game of Thrones TV series Hafér Júlíus Björnsson.
The previous Finnish winner of the competition is Janne Virtanen, who was number one in 2000.
Restaurant ship M/S Tampere crashed on the rocks in Pyhäjärvi - "Standingly caught with a rock"
Inland waterway ship M/S Tampere ran off late on Friday evening in Akaa, Pyhäjärvi.
The rescue department received an alarm about a water traffic accident on Friday evening after 5:30.
The 30-metre ship M/S Tampere has drifted to the rocks, and is firmly attached to its bow on the rocks, says fire master Matti Willman.
The ship was carried by 19 passengers and five crew members.
According to the rescue department, personal damage was avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been able to evacuate to the mainland from the ship.
Now they are being moved by bus to Tampere, said the on-call chief Jari Nieminen to STT after 1 pm.
Ambulances were called to the port of Viila to receive evacuated passengers.
The ship from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had for some reason drifted off its route west of the narrow Jumusensalmi.
The police are investigating the cause of the incident.
Earlier in the evening, fire master Matti Willman said that the conditions in the lake are difficult because of the darkness and the fairly heavy wind.
According to the rescue department, the ship's fate is unclear.
Apparently the ship isn't leaking.
After the evacuation operation, divers begin to check the situation at the bottom.
The M/S Tampere, built in 1957, is now an inland waterway ship operating as a restaurant ship, with a maximum number of 180 passengers.
The ship also has a meeting space to rent for private use.
According to the ship's website, the cruiser has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
The frozen air is passing - see today's weather forecast here

Ex-managers demand bonuses from Robert Helenius
Boxer Robert Helenius' fight tonight against Erkan Teper is being followed by a money dispute.
Ilta-Sanomat reported today about a challenge application from boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and deputy judge Jussi Kokkila, in which Helenius is charged a total of well over 80,000 euros in unpaid manager fees with interest on delays.
According to the challenge application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius on 15.4.2014-30.1.2015.
We have tried to compromise, but there is no other option.
There has been a clear mandate here, and a lot of work has been done," Kokkila says to Ilta-Sanomis.
Helenius' current manager Markus Sundman sent an equivalent to Iltalehti, which tells the boxer's view of the events.
Helenius denies that he is obliged to pay the required amount.
According to the response, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services to Helenius in an economically awkward situation and had promised to arrange matches and sponsorship income for him.
It was agreed, literally, that Helenius is obliged to pay only a percentage of the fees for his matches.
Repeatedly it was assured that Helenius doesn't have to pay anything, just receives their income.
This is also normal and the only practice in the management of professional athletes.
Salary work has never been agreed, and it would also have been absurd in Helenius' situation, Sundman explains in his message.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
According to the response, Helenius would have liked to have agreed on the distribution of income in writing from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman did not arrive at the draft until the end of 2014.
He said the proposal was bad for himself and stopped working with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius did not fight once in his dealings with Kokkila and Helminen.
A year after the end of the cooperation, Helenius had been given an "unique but massive" bill for the manager's work.
This year, the same claims have been filed.
Helenius considers the ex-post activities of Helminen and Kokkila to be cowardly, the response states.
Helenius today meets Erkan Teper in Stuttgart, the seventh in the IBF heavyweight challenger list.
A hearty man and a good reporter
Entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the late radio host and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
Long line radio host and journalist Erkki Pälli died of incurable liver cancer at the age of 83.
The plotter's obituary was published in Sanomat, Helsinki, on Sunday.
The ad said Päll died on September 3.
Pälli told about a serious illness on her Facebook page in March 2018.
Ile Vainio, who was saddened by an acquaintance's fate, also saw the publication.
He said goodbye earlier on Facebook, as it were, Ile Vainio said.
Vaino thinks Erkki Päll is a multi-talented talent who became a great journalist.
He remembers Päll was a liked person with fast pitchers and fun things.
I got to know Erkki already as a little boy when I first went to Finn album at 12 and started there as a stockman.
Erk and I met back then.
At the time, he was Finn levy's press officer and in different positions, Ile Vainio recalls.
When I went to make records as a music producer, there were hundreds of events where Erkki Pälli was a regular reporter at all the parties to do stories about artists.
He was always expert and I saw how big a fire he had for entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got right into the skin of his interviewees.
He was a hearty man and a good reporter.
For many, he became known as a respected Yle radio driver, but he also wrote great newspaper stories.
Erkki interviewed me several times, too.
He was good at talking, Vainio says.
During the decades Pälli worked with Toivo Kärje, in addition to journalistic work, with Fazer record company.
He was a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir's records.
The biggest passion of Pälli, however, was the radio work in which he had a unique style.
He was doing radio work since the 1960s, and he became familiar to a number of listeners in Yle's aether.
Pälli retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Association announced on Saturday that the annual season that ended in May showed a profit of about EUR 450,000.
The union describes its economic situation as a 'full turn', although the economy is, of course, burdened with a 'significant debt in the balance sheet'.
Managing Director Mika Kulmala praises quick response and strict financial discipline.
Last autumn we reacted to the situation as quickly as possible by taking adjustment measures.
Careful planning of operations and financial management have been introduced throughout our organisation, Kulmala says in the release.
We have also done well in partner procurement, and in addition, the world cup yields were maximum during the past season.
However, in the future, costs management must be precise, and at the same time we must constantly look for new financing models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence
There are dozens of bodies lying in the hospital's backyard in the town of Palu on the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia.
Only one building separates them from an area where injured survivors have been gathered to assess the injuries and the need for treatment.
Patients are also treated outdoors for aftershocks.
One of those in the hospital area was Baharuddin, a 52-year-old from Palu, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses just one name.
I have one child, and he is missing.
The last time I spoke to him was when he was going to school, Baharuddin told the news agency AFP.
Dwi Haris, who has been injured in his back and arm, was lying in Palu in the courtyard area of the military hospital.
When the quake began, he was in a local hotel with his wife and daughter.
The family had been invited to Palu's wedding party.
I was probably squeezed under a collapsed wall.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what's happened to him and my kid.
I hope they are safe, Haris told the AP news agency according to British media.
Small shops are being robbed
Risa Kusuma, 35-year-old baby's mother, tried to calm her feverish baby at the Palu evacuation centre.
He described the atmosphere in the city as tight.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere, Kusuma said.
Many of Palu's residents have slept outdoors or in temporary bamboos.
Even if the house is still in place, possible aftershocks could destroy it once and for all and bury the residents.
According to the Associated Press, more than half of the prisoners in Palu prison escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
There were reportedly about 560 prisoners, so there are possibly about 300 fugitives.
Also some of the prisoners in Donggala prison have escaped, says The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, the prisoners became furious and set the prison on fire after the guards had forbidden them to leave to search for relatives affected by the earthquake and tsunami.
Palu Airport has been reopened mainly for relief flights.
Among the first to land was the army's C-130 transport plane, which brought relief supplies.
Commercial flights to Palu airport are only allowed to a limited extent.
The pilots have to land on the airport without the help of air traffic control, as the tower was badly damaged in the earthquake.
Rain sweeps across Finland at night
A long rainy area spreads across the country from westward on a night against Sunday, says the Meteorological Institute.
The rain comes mostly as water, but it is expected to sleet or snow in central and northern Lapland.
The frosty temperatures of the previous night are not repeating, because under the cloud cover the temperatures remain higher.
The cloudier night keeps the lowest temperatures in place quite efficiently.
In the west, it is possible to visit the cold for a moment, said the on-call meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rainy area recedes east during the morning.
In the south and west, there are pouty or semi-clouds.
In the afternoon, temperatures move up to Oulu's height around 10-13 degrees.
The early week looks similar in terms of temperatures in the southern and central parts of the country, but the weather becomes more unstable.
There are wind and wave warnings in the sea areas.
There are no actual autumn storms expected for the next few days, but otherwise there will be typical weather in the autumn.
That autumn is really starting to push on now, Ilkka said.
Miss Suomi final is not seen on TV
From IL-TV you can follow the red carpet glamour and sparkle of the Miss Suomi competition.
Iltalehti's entertainment journalists are running live on IL TV from the red carpet of Miss Suomi's finals from Billnäs's pot.
The broadcast begins at about 6.50 p.m.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned with ten finalists on Saturday.
The Miss Suomi 2018 final will be at Billnäs's Ruukke in Raasepori.
Before the finals begin, you can watch the atmosphere from the ground on IL-TV's live broadcast.
Live broadcast starts at about 6.30 p.m. and continues for about an hour.
This year, especially many Miss Finland winners from previous years have been invited to the final.
They are represented in the jury by Miss Finland Jonna Ziprus of 1998.
Other members of the jury include welfare entrepreneur Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammouda, Jounin Kauppa's CEO Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen and news producer Katja Lintunen.
We were hoping he'd get to college before going to the Missile Games.
Russian father Dimitri and mother Svetlana from Inkera believed her daughter's success in the Miss Suomi final.
The parents of fresh Miss Finland Alina Voronkov, Dimitri Voronkov, and Svetlana Voronkova, proudly followed her daughter's first moments in the crown.
They came to the audience from Pertunmaa and were going to drive back home after the final.
It's a lovely atmosphere!
We believed in Erika all the time, but half an hour before the result it was getting nervous, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is an Inkerian and Dimitri is a Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian, even though she has lived her whole childhood in Finland.
Svetlana says that Alina was more interested in acting when she was a kid than in Miss.
Alina was often told that when she was so pretty, she should become a Miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio host.
It wasn't until later that Alina got excited about the beauty contests.
The parents wanted Alina to be admitted to the university before taking part in the Miss Suomi competition.
That was the case, and eventually Alina wanted to finish the Kandi degree before the Missile Games.
We asked him why he didn't take part last year, but he wanted to finish it.
Parents believe Alina won the competition because she is a wholesome example for young people and adults.
He does a lot of sports and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be on display, it shows.
Alina's boyfriend Joonas Hurri plays hockey in Japan for a living, and he did not get to encourage his love in the final.
Alina's parents believe that the youth relationship lasts a Miss Year.
Yes, it is meant to be!
The parents hoped that the daughter would soon be able to visit.
It's been such a long break from visiting because of the missis.
I'm already missing you, even though they've been sending messages.
A young man died in a hit-and-run in Lahti - police apprehended three people
According to the police, three people have been apprehended as a result of the incident.
On Saturday, Häme police did not comment on the course of the events or on the possible intent of the hit-and-run, claiming that the investigation was incomplete.
The police also did not comment on whether the apprehended persons and the man killed in the hit-and-run knew each other from before.
Further information on the case will be available at the earliest at the beginning of next week.
Sari Piipp left his career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - the idea of a comic book came to mind: the lack of drawing skills did not slow down
At one time, organic nonsense left my husband's statement, in which he suggested it as a person for the story I developed, says Sari Piipp, an Espoian cartoon blogger, a housewife and a former EU translator.
Sari Piippo said he was an EU economic and legal translator in Brussels until after the fourth child the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I've enjoyed being a housewife.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it occurred to me, what would you do when you were growing up, when even the smallest child started to be big?
Then a comic book came into the picture in 2014.
Pippo says he had never dreamed of making a comic book, even though he had read Aku Duck, Tint and Asterix since childhood.
The last time I had drawn was when I was a kid, but when these organic manuscripts began to emerge, the situation changed.
At first I wrote some dozens of manuscripts in the drawer.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a skilled cartoonist, but I couldn't lure her into it until the summer of 2016 when I used the board to bribe her.
His enthusiasm lasted about a dozen stripes, and then I had to start trying myself, says Pippo, who said the record was a great incentive for him.
The board is an easy and convenient tool to try to make something happen.
I didn't even try to draw on the paper, says Piippo about his relationship with drawing, which he usually does in the evenings.
Manuscripts pop up in your head all the time, but I don't usually finish at once.
One of the three-screen strip takes up to several hours.
I might make a screen at a time and enjoy playing with the colors.
Starting to draw is always the hardest, because drawing is not my strongest sport.
Sari Piippo says he appreciates Scott Adams' Dilbert, among other things, from the current comics in the newspapers.
The organic characters are a carrot-body mother who has a salad-haired hair who has been cheering on the L-themed.
Other people are Man, Pissis and Gemini.
In an organic world, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the show come from your own life and social media.
Sari Piippo doesn't want to preach or offer to make a fuss, even if it's between organic nonsense and intrusive.
Pippo says he will read his series with his husband and children.
After all, it's such a great feeling when you look at a cartoon you're drawing and you say that this is what I've done today.
And there are challenges for the housewife!

Indonesia's earthquake: The air traffic controller sacrificed himself - didn't leave a crackling tower until he got hundreds of passengers to safety
Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21-year-old air traffic controller, has become the hero of the Indonesian earthquake.
Agung was left alone in the control tower until he managed to escort hundreds of passengers safely from the earthquake - shaken island.
The young man was on duty at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in Palu city when the earthquake struck on Friday.
As others fled from the air traffic control tower, Agung refused to leave his seat before being able to direct Batik Air's passenger plane from the runway into the air.
In this way he could save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian FAA told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport Saturday after the earthquake.
The air traffic control tower trembled and cracked.
Finally, Agung tried to escape by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg was broken and he suffered severe internal injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was to be transported by helicopter to a better equipped facility, but he passed away 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, a representative of the FAA told The Jakarta Post.
The earthquake continued to increase after the flight reached the air, and its strength was finally measured at 7.5 magnitudes.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian FAA has respected Agung's heroism in social media.
Rehn wondered Yle about Europe ending up in a trade war: "You have to watch the next tweet"
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the global economy as a whole.
Growth forecasts have been calculated across Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly reduced its own economic growth estimates.
CEO Olli Rehn said in Yle's first morning that even though tension does not have a direct impact on Europe's trade flows, it undermines confidence, which in turn is reflected in companies' investment decisions.
The situation also applies to Finnish companies' exports.
Mr Rehn thinks that Europe is so far well-off.
It has been able to build a truce with the United States and has helped to calm the situation also with China and Japan.
In Rehn's view, Europe does not seem to grind to the feet of a trade war.
You have to watch the next tweet and then evaluate it.
We have a pretty unpredictable partner in the direction of Washington, however, he said in an interview with Yle.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is the third largest economy in the euro area, Italy, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and the whole Western world.
The market reacted violently yesterday to the clearly deficit budget presented by the Italian Government on Thursday evening.
Next year's deficit is over 2.4 per cent of GDP.
Mr Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
Five per cent of the country's loan stock is problem credit and unstructured credit is over ten per cent.
In addition, its public finances are weak and the country seems to be once again exceeding its commitment to its European partners.
It may not be worth painting yet more crises, Rehn replied when asked whether Italy would lead Europe to a new economic crisis.
Another issue that is testing Europe is Britain's resignation from the EU.
Rehn hoped it would be settled.
A dispute would have far more negative effects.
Rehn started as President of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), will withdraw from office in just over a year's time.
The conversation about his successor has begun.
Both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikanen's name have flashed in.
It probably doesn't matter if Finnish names are involved, Rehn said, adding that he won't comment further.
HS's super popular Black Box shows will continue again next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black Box performances organised by Helsingin Sanomat will continue again in the beginning of the week.
Other performances will be shown at the National Theatre on October 2, 8 and 11.
October 23 The Black Box will visit Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets to the national theatre.
Tampere's performance has been sold out.
Tickets are sold by Lippu.fi.
Journalists and photographers on stage during the evening tell a long-time prepared true story that has not previously been published in any of HS's instruments.
There is again something that no one has ever heard.
"There is a strange spy in Helsinki's night, impressive report across the globe, and a talking story about a very topical health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the Black Box producers.
After the performance, the audience will have the opportunity to meet HS journalists and photographers and to continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has organised live journalism evenings for three years.
They have been popular from the beginning and often sold out.
Over 15,000 people have already visited the stands.
The black box was awarded at the Bonnier gala as a journalistic act of the year.
The winners praised the new way of doing journalism and the journalistic desire to come close to his readers.
The spring 2019 Black Box will be seen at the National Theatre in March-April.
The performance also visits Tampere and Turku.
The proposal to be seen at that time has a different content than in the evenings of this autumn.
The missing mushroomer was found because of an "unprejudiced experiment"
Finnish police's drone skills are the top in the world: "We are being asked about training"
According to the headmaster of the Police Academy of Applied Sciences, police can use drone in addition to searching for missing persons, for example in crime scene investigations and intelligence missions.
On Tuesday, the Oulu police managed to find a missing mushroom blocker in Raahe with drone in just a couple of minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, the headmaster of the Police Academy of Applied Sciences, tweeted about the case and mentioned, among other things, that "with an unprejudiced experiment and effective training we are also the world's leading player."
Drone is quite new and even more recent in police duties.
There are no statistics anywhere that the Finnish police are the champion of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong belief that this is the case.
This has been clear, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported at international events.
There is a lot of interest elsewhere in it, says Himberg.
It would be hard for visitors to see the Finnish police's drone activity.
We're being asked for training.
Getting even more common
Himberg points out that finding a missing person in winter conditions in Finland as soon as possible is very important.
As stated, in the case of Raahe, a lost person was found with drone in just a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, they are to be trained more.
Already, drones are widely used in police tasks, and their use will become more widespread and increasing in the future.
That is what I would dare to say, says Himberg.
In addition to searching for missing persons, Himberg says the police can use drones in, for example, accident or crime scene investigations and certain intelligence missions.
For example, it is already necessary to check some area a bit further, where it is possible to fear that violence will be encountered there.
Drone can then be used for advance intelligence.
Karelian Rugby ascended to number one divariate
Karelian Rugby celebrated the victory of the 2 division in Kuopio on Saturday.
The Joensuuers were still in the middle of the match with a 7-12 defeat for the Helsinki Rugby Club, but they found a plot in the second period, and the guests from the south were on the porch 26-12.
At the same time, the 2-division championship knew that Karelian Rugby had a historic rise to 1-division.
Previously, the club has played in number one, but at the time Finnish rugby's serial operations were divided into two levels, the SM series and more blocks of 1 division.
The club is going to take the show place, but it will be quite a job next winter.
The current roster of less than twenty players needs to be raised to 25.
The 1-division also knows about the increase in the number of games and longer gaming trips, so the fundraising must also be in line with that.
Kotkaniemi starts the season in Montreal, confirms the head coach
The Montreal Canadiens head coach Claude Julien, who is playing in the NHL, confirmed on the club's Twitter account that Finnish attacker Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal made a super promise in Kotkaniemi, 18, in the first round number three at the summer booking event.
The attacker joined Montreal's training strength at the end of the summer and has shown strong action in September's training matches.
Kotkaniemi managed to score the goal in its first training match.
Chief coach Julien praised the Finns for taking big developments after arriving at the rookie camp.
The NHL regular season begins next week on the night against Thursday, Finland's time.
Montreal will face the opening round of the Toronto Maple Leafs.
What is a good leader?
This week a lot has been said about leadership in Finland.
In an interview with HS, the chairman of Nokia's board, Risto Siilasmaa, told about his book Paranoid's optimist, in which he sheds light on his leadership philosophy.
At the same time, he criticises the leadership of his predecessor Jorma Ollila.
Ollila strongly denied the accusations, but previous Nokia studies have also talked about leaders' inability to act as a team; fear and speechlessness, which in part caused the mobile phone business to collapse.
The company's high-risk ability and agility disappeared.
During the week in Helsinki, a big business event Nordic Business Forum was also organised, which drew Finnish business cream to the Messukeskus.
In addition to Barack Obama, 12 business stars rose to the stage.
There was enough talk about good leadership.
The legend of leadership doctrines, Gary Hamel, said that a good leader must have the courage to take the company into the future, even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that the decisions are made by those who are the ones most emotionally linked to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, founder of the Whole Foods chain, known for a wide range of organic products, said the manager should be able to communicate to the whole staff for the purpose of the company.
And that can't just be making a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote about the introverts in the book of success, said that the most successful leaders are studied to be humble.
They acted calmly, quietly and decisively.
Often they are introverts.
Aswath Damodaran, a financial professor, reminded that the qualities of a good manager should coincide with the life cycle phase of the company.
At the beginning of the company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the company's future is based.
A company that has grown into a mature stage needs a leader who knows the numbers.
7 500 visitors - mainly Finnish leaders - listened to these lessons at the Nordic Business Forum.
They were in danger of having a piece of information.
It takes a lot for a good leader.
That's why management often goes wrong, even at the highest level.
Siilasmaa and Ollila were also present.
They talked to each other in front of each other in a friendly way.
However, they hardly wondered whether they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy to estimate from an outsider.
Sara Chafak came to the red carpet straight from Los Angeles - to spend most of her year abroad
Model Sara Chafak arrived at the Miss Final in a stunning black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finland's spectacular dress also had a laced drag.
A bit of jet lag.
I came back from Los Angeles again.
I spend a lot of my time there," Chafak says.
Chafak says he's going to L.A. for an audition.
He has done ad shoots, among other things.
He describes his work in the United States as interesting, and also similar to that in Finland.
However, he said the work needs to be done even harder, because there is always a replacement for the model's work.
You have to push harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.
Choreographer Sonya Lindfors 30,000 euros live art prize in Kuopio
Artist Sonya Lindfors won a 30,000-euro cultural prize in Kuopio on Saturday.
The Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art winner Lindfors works on choreography, community activism and teaching.
Sonya Lindfors' art is vital for its immediate surroundings.
His work gives others the opportunity to work and create spaces for dialogue in environments they have previously lacked, the jury described the winner.
In addition to Finnish Lindfors, a number of international artists were nominated for the award.
The award is awarded annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group working in the field of live art.
The Danish police found the Volvo they were looking for: "We can't tell you where."
The extensive search by the Danish police has produced results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed at Öresund and Great-Belt bridges.
All land and ferry traffic from the island of Själlann was closed to Sweden, Germany and elsewhere in Denmark.
The police were looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS reached the chief of staff at the Copenhagen Police Media Centre.
They found the car they were looking for.
We can't tell where the car was found yet, Henrik Storm from the Copenhagen police announcement tells Ilta-Sanom.
According to Storm, the wanted black Volvo has no direct contact with the threat.
According to him, the greatest danger is over.
Ekstra Bladet, a Danish, told about the police's Saturday press conference.
Chief of Investigation Jørgen Bergen Skov was silent about the operation.
He didn't want to tell me what crime heading is being investigated.
However, Skov said it was a "serious crime."
It was a threat to people's lives.
Three people have been searched for in the operation.
Police won't tell us if they've already been apprehended.
According to the newspaper, the restrictions on ferry traffic have been cancelled.
The Copenhagen police also watched the events on their Twitter account.
According to the police, however, the public has nothing to worry about, since certain people were threatened.
Macedonia's name has caused divisions for decades - now the people are voting in controversial elections
A proposal for a new name is currently being voted on in Macedonia in the Balkans.
According to an agreement between the governments of Macedonia and Greece, the Republic of Northern Macedonia would be named.
So far, Greece has vetoed Macedonia's efforts to become a member of NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, Macedonia's name belongs to its northern province.
The issue of the referendum does not mention a new name, but asks whether the voters are in favour of Macedonia's EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement.
The vote began slowly, at least at a school in the centre of the capital, Skopje.
Retired nurse Olivera Argirosvka, who voted at the school, hoped for support for the agreement.
A referendum will mean a change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
It means a change especially for young people, he said.
Macedonia, which became independent in 1991, has been officially called the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's government has campaigned to approve the agreement.
The nationalistic right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, there is a lot of excitement as to whether the voting turnout will rise above the required 50 per cent.
The referendum is not binding, but the victory of the yes votes would allow the mandate to change the constitution.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is needed for the change to the constitution.
The Greek Parliament also still has to approve the agreement.
The polling stations close at 8 pm Finnish time.
Handsome victory!
Robert Helenius knocked out Erka Teper
Robert Helenius met Erkan Teper late Saturday night in a heavyweight professional boxing match in Germany.
A 34-year-old Finn measured his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch, near Stuttgart.
The evening's main match was the IBF heavyweight Intercontinental title match.
Its winner can be given the opportunity to compete in tougher tasks, which have a significant economic significance, that have been seen on Saturday.
Helenius solved the match in the eighth round, when he knocked out Teper with his hard left hand punch.
Teper was no longer able to get off the floor.
"Nordic Nightmare" hurt his opponent already in the third period, when the German nose began to bleed.
Helenius and Teper first met in the ring.
They were supposed to fight already in December 2015.
That's when Teper appealed to the injury and withdrew from the match.
After that, it turned out that the German had been burned twice in a doping test.
Helenius has taken 28 matches from his professional career and suffered two losses.
Teper has won 19 professional matches in his career and lost three times as a clear favourite.
Hamilton with a stable order to win - break up with Vettel already 50 points
The Formula One championship was approaching confirmation again, because Mercedes Lewis Hamilton won Russia's GP and stretched his World Championship scoring lead to Ferrari Sebastian Vettel to 50 points already (306-256).
There are only five cats left.
Valtteri Bottas, who left the pole seat in the race, drove second.
Last year in Sochi, Bottas, who had won his career, held the lead in the middle of the race, but Mercedes told Botta to let Hamilton go.
Vettel drove third, Ferrari Kimi Räikkönen fourth.
Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who started the last line of departure, was the fifth.
Two of them assaulted a jukalainenman in Joensuu - caught a block away
Two men beat and kicked a 31-year-old Jewish man in Joensuu at Siltakatu 12 on Saturday after 6 pm.
According to the police, the men also stole the victim's phone, among other things.
The police reached the suspects, a 35-year-old man with a haystack and a 39-year-old man in Ilomantsi, a block away from the event.
They were apprehended as a suspect in a robbery, police say.
The victim suffered bruising that did not require a visit to a doctor.
Elon Musk, CEO of the electric car company Tesla, will leave his position as chairman of the company's board.
Musk has agreed with the U.S. authorities.
At the same time, Musk has been fined $20 million for his tweets that he would have secured funding to withdraw Tesla from the stock market.
The SEC has accused Musk of securities fraud.
Musk will continue to be Tesla's CEO, but the company will also have to pay a fine of EUR 20 million if the agreement between the authorities and Muski is confirmed in court.
Canada fights time to make peace with Nafta USA
Time is threatening to run out in the middle of negotiations between the United States and Canada on a free trade agreement on Nafta.
The United States has set a deadline for Sunday, and their negotiators have discussed closely throughout the weekend.
Canada's main negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed his speech at the UN General Assembly to focus on trade negotiations at full weight.
At President Donald Trump's request, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago to reform the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement, but no agreement has yet been reached with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want to bring the agreement into effect before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won the Mexican presidential election, takes office in early December.
Trump has said that Canada's involvement in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that it is planned to sign the contract at the end of November - whether Canada is involved or not.
Because of these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday to allow the US Congress enough time to assess it.
Neighbor thought candles were a fire in Kaakkkuri - the fire department was alerted to the scene
The candles burned in an apartment building in Kaakkkur, Oulu, caused a fire alarm on the night against Sunday.
A dozen rescue department units were alerted to the scene because of a possible fire in an apartment building.
On the spot it was discovered that the candles burned in the apartment's sauna had looked like a fire across from the house, which was why the emergency room had been notified.
There was no fire in the target.
The police caught 11 people after the Honka-HJK match - brawl in the field and at the metro station
The police apprehended eleven people on Saturday after the men's football league Honka-HJK match in Espoo, the police commissioner Teemu Värtinen from the West Uusimaa Police Department confirmed to STT.
The reason for the arrest was protection against crime and disturbance.
The apprehended were released after the situation had calmed down, Värtinen said.
Earlier, Ilta-Sanomat told about the arrests.
The match ended 0-0.
After the final whistle, a large crowd of viewers rushed to the field from the stands reserved for HJK supporters.
The situation led to pushing and fist fights between the supporters of the teams.
Cavalry officers, among other things, were needed to put an end to the situation.
In addition to the field, there was a brawl in the area of a nearby metro station, where some of the catch-up took place.
I wasn't there, but what I saw from the photos was unpleasant, Värtinen referred to the incident on the field.
According to Värtinen, no criminal reports have been filed as a result of the events.
The tablestone hastened the butterfly swim in its SE time in the World Cup, Laukkanen also swims in the finals
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Päikivi have progressed to finals on the closing day of World Cup 3/7 in Holland.
The games are swimming in Eindhoven on short track.
HSS's Tablestone hastened Finland's record in a 50-metre butterfly swim, where he was second in the early 22.82.
Earlier in September, Päikivi swam in Helsinki during the SE season 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen, representing the Espoo-based Cetus, was 24.68 in the 24th time of the butterfly swim.
Swimming Club Vuokatti's Laukkanen was 30.48 in the first 50 metres breast swim in the sixth time and advanced to the final.
Laukkanen was the 15th at 2.14.25 in the beginning of the two hundred metres swim.
Students perform a rare treat: an ancient tragedy - reduced Oresteia is influenced by its visuality
Ancient tragedies are a rare treat on Finnish stage.
For example, the National Theatre has last seen an ancient tragedy, Sofokleen Filoktetes, in 1988.
Now the Theatre Academy brought to the tour of the National Theatre the only drama trilogy of ancient history, Aiskylus Oresteia.
In the Lavat open! projects that began in 2015, the actors students of the Theatre Academy work together with a professional director internationally.
This fourth project, like the first one, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
Orestea, an international premiere, was given in Berlin in April.
Roihan's agreement on Orestea sums up the story of the end of the Atreus family's vendetta and the birth of the rule of law in a worthy hour to 20 minutes, especially by intensifying choir sections.
The work succeeds in being very loyal to the spirit of Kirsti Simonmainen's fine translation (2003).
Dramatic lights and the revealing presentation of the theatre space highlight a simple and bright stage thinking.
Its focus is alternately on the dynamics between the performers who break out of the choir, who play name roles, and the choir.
Both double and triple seats are used in the performance.
The actors will not leave the stage at all, so, for example, the killings of Agamemnon, who will return from the war in Troy, and his spoils, Cassandra, will be shown on the stage, as was the custom in the ancient tradition.
Of course, the performance does not stress its loyalty to the ancient tradition of performance.
Rather, a modern, faithful interpretation of the text is created in front of the viewer's eyes, which is constantly aware of its ritual roots.
Roiha has managed to bring up a rhythmic group of master's stage actress students as a close group, just one organism.
Especially in the choir sections, actors that are flexiblely bent on very expressive, sculpture-like group formations will be able to get their rights on the bare stage, only with a white curtain adorned.
I'm impressed.
Oresteia's performance tour continues to Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer manufactures its first hydrogen truck
The newness is beginning to appear in Europe, especially thanks to the cooperation agreement with Hyindai and Swiss H2 Energy.
According to a cooperation agreement published in Hanover's IAA commercial vehicle exhibition, Hyundai will supply a thousand car batch of new models to the Swiss company and its partners.
By bringing a fuel cell-powered lorry to the market, Hyundai continues as a hydrogen vehicle manufacturer with Nexo and ix35-Tucson Fuel Cell models.
With this first project of its kind, we are taking fuel cell technology even further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market for these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the refuelling network, says In Cheol Lee, Hyundai Motor's vice president, at the release of the contract.
The fists flashed several times in Kajaani
A man in his early 30s assaulted three men in a restaurant in the centre of Kajaani and in front of it on Saturday morning.
The man first hit one man inside the restaurant, as a result of which he was removed from the scene.
Outside he pushed another man to the ground, and in the absence of a third man, the abuser hit him, too.
The police caught the abuser.
At the police station, the man continued to act aggressively and kicked another cop in the leg.
He also threatened the police with assault and killing.
The man was taken to jail to calm down.
The matter will be investigated as three assaults and violent protests against an official.
There was also another assault in the centre of Kajaani in Välikatu on Saturday morning.
The victim was beaten by two men.
First, a 20-year-old Kajaan man struck the victim.
A little later, another man knocked him down and the man who beat him earlier kicked the victim.
The outsiders pulled the abusers away from the victim and the police were called.
However, the perpetrators had already left before the police arrived.
Police will ask eyewitnesses to contact Kajaani police by telephone 0295 416 520 or by email to investigation.kainuu@politiikka.fi.
Long line radio host Erkki Pälli is dead
Erkki Pälli, known as Yle's long-term journalist, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio host Erkki Pälli, 83, is dead.
He died of incurable liver cancer, which he reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
This is it.
Even the doctor said that, I live a day at a time, he commented on his situation in Iltalehti a month ago.
The safety of shop aunts and uncles must be guaranteed
For the first time in 1984, I received a salary for a newspaper article.
When you're amazed at a topic with these vintage rings, it's usually a big news story.
When I wrote (Karelialainen, 27.9.) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was amazed and even a little angry for a moment.
I also spoke to the service trade union (PAM) working environment expert Erika Kähäraa.
He says crime statistics don't tell the real situation.
The problem is growing, even though employers say otherwise, of course.
The police only know of cases that are clearly perceived as serious, and many of the real violent situations remain unreported.
"The companies have a duty to record their near-miss status on the basis of the Safety and Health Act, but these statistics remain for internal use and their data is not collected anywhere," he said.
Mental injuries don't end up in the statistics.
In violent situations, there has always been the problem that they do not always result in physical injuries.
Despite this, mental traumas can be much more serious than bruising and wounds.
The difference between a violent situation and a threatening violence situation is difficult to draw when even aggressive threats of a certain level have to be counted as violence - even if there is no assault.
Too many people are afraid at work, even though there is no actual act.
Some residential areas are restless.
The store has acquired security.
As store opening hours were released, the media was also showing a lot of its effects on the sellers' security.
"At that time, quite a number of employers arranged security services for at least overnight hours and to prevent working alone," Kähärä commented.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is drawn.
This seems to have had an effective effect now, but this will produce a new negative trend.
When security kept the disruptions well under control, the impression was that security would be unnecessary.
Now many places are trying to find solutions that could remove expensive security services.
Mild assault is a crime of the plaintiff, and it is quite understandable that the seller who was abused does not want to make an inquiry about a criminal who usually lives near the shop.
But according to the same section of the 2011 Act, minor assault will be subject to the prosecutor if it happens at the workplace.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time an aunt or uncle is abused at the store, the police should investigate and the prosecutor should accuse.
When the court put a couple of abusers in jail, and the sentence from that harsh end of the penalty scale, the customs would be cleaned up.
A society in which the grocery store must be open in small towns almost day and night must guarantee the safety of its employees.
Heidi Sohlberg signed for Miss before the live broadcast - "Sara, Iiro is then married"
Miss's crowning is not seen on TV this year, but on the Viafree website.
The broadcast is hosted by former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and host of the NHL and KHL studios in Viasat and Viaplay, Iiro Harjula.
Backstage and red carpet are hosted by Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the host filmmaker told the invited guests and media representatives who arrived about the broadcast's progress.
At first Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a round of applause.
Now all the women scream!
Take a look at this man we're dealing with, Sohlberg cheered his colleagues as the crowd cheered.
Many of the previous years' Miss Finland will follow the games from the front row.
Among other things, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi sat next to each other and Sohlberg threw a little joke in either direction.
Sara, Iiro is married!
Sohlberg was groping towards Saros.
Most likely, Mr Sohlberg pointed to the recently divorced Siepp, who laughed at the comment, even though he seemed confused at first.
Sieppi spoke about his divorce for the first time in the Ilta-Sanomie weekend paper.
Missikaunotar said she doesn't want to open the reasons for the divorce more clearly in public, because that is between her and Roope Salminen.
He said he's not busy with a new relationship, he's going to focus on himself.
I'm focusing on my own stuff, and especially I'm starting to live my own life alone, Sara Sieppi said.
Harjula's marriage status came up even later, when Sohlberg mistakenly called Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The banter laughed at the screw-up.
Iiro was married, or how did it go?
Janni Hussi signed for the mistake.
The Northman tortured his tied cohabiting partner by cutting, burning and feeding strong sauce
The District Court of Ostrobothnia has sentenced a 34-year-old man who lived in Kokkola to three years in prison for numerous crimes against his common-law spouse.
The crime-making tool included a belt, a cable, and a bunch of ties.
The court ruled that the items in question were lost to the State.
He was charged with a suspected aggravated rape.
However, this charge was dismissed by the District Court.
The Kokkolalainen was blamed for four assaults, aggravated assault, coercion, unlawful threat, deprivation of liberty, gross deprivation of liberty and two acts of injury.
The crimes took place between 26 March and 24 May.
At the end of the last actions, the man was apprehended and imprisoned a couple of days later.
On Thursday of the past week, the District Court of Ostrobothnia handed down its sentence and ordered the 34-year-old to continue to be held in Vaasa prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also charged with two aggravated deprivations of liberty and aggravated rape on 22 May.
However, these charges were dismissed as unproven.
The case was handled in court behind closed doors.
However, the district judge gave a public statement of the sentence.
According to the district judge, the accused had subjected his spouse to violence, threats and coercion in situations where he had been tied up.
The accused cut his victim with a knife, smoked with a cigarette, fed strong sauce and poured water and coffee on top of it.
By his sentence, the court ordered the state to lose criminal equipment: a belt and cable, bundle ties, a bathrobe belt, a knife and a hammer.
Four Witnesses
According to the District Court, the parties continued to live together between the actions.
It can be read from the verdict that a large part of the grossest actions took place at the end of the criminal cycle.
Four witnesses, two women and two men were heard in the court.
A 34-year-old should pay a total of EUR 5800 for pain, pain, suffering and temporary harm.
He probably doesn't have that money, because the sentenced person already has debts from his old age in recovery.
The prison sentence is not the man's first.
Iltalehti does not give the name of the sentenced person to protect the victim's privacy.
A recent district court sentence is not valid when writing this.
Europe leading four points to Ryder Cup solution
On Saturday, European golf professionals imprisoned their lead in a traditional punch match against the United States.
Europe will lead the Ryder Cup on the outskirts of Paris with a score of 10-6, while there will still be 12 doubles on Sunday.
Europe won three out of four of the four-ball matches that started on Saturday, and in the afternoon's four-ball match, the winnings were evened out 2-2.
European leaders were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches they played in pairs on Friday and Saturday.
Earlier, no European couple had reached the same level.
On Sunday, the duo is seeking more history.
No European player has won five points in one Ryder Cup, and there are only three of the Americans: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns the violent harassment of its supporters in the Honka game: "Voice is not part of football"
Football's betting league team HJK published a statement on Sunday condemning their supporters' behaviour in a Saturday FC Honka match in Tapiola.
"We apologize for what happened after the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," the statement states.
At the end of the match, about 50 HJK supporters stormed the field and some seemed to be trying to pick a fight with Honga supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
The organizers didn't calm the situation down, they needed police officers and also horse police.
HJK says in its statement that the team's players and staff are shocked by what happened.
Events after the match are not in line with the values of our traditional 111-year-old club.
"We are categorically dissociating ourselves from any activity that endangers the security of the match events," the press release said.
HJK promises to help authorities and event organisers to identify threats to security and eliminate mild phenomena.
Proponent culture is part of football and an important thing for HJK.
We support in every way positive, joyous and encouraging activities in football stands.
"Violence is not a part of it," the press release says.
Filipino inventor flies a drone car - thus avoiding traffic jams
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Pele Peleto.
He is now part of a growing group in the world who swears to have invented a flying car - or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
Mendiola, however, does not believe in mass production of its equipment.
According to reports from the world, the man has spent much of his fortune building his dream.
Six years ago, he started developing his flying car.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he made the first successful test flight - he flew with his machine at altitudes of over seven metres.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope the device will cause positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said according to British Daily Mail.
JHL predicts: Tomorrow's industrial action will be visible in children's day care and social and health services
The bans on overtime and shift change will begin in the public and welfare sectors tomorrow, especially in social services, health services and day care for children, estimates JHL president Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The effects will be extensive and will certainly be visible in a way that there are not enough staff present.
Everyone has to think about how to pick up their children.
It is now the job of the employer to ensure that the services play and that no one's life is threatened, says Niemi-Laine to STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the shortage of employees was also visible at the beginning of the year, when JHL members were banned from overtime and shift change due to contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible, through flexibility, not to hire staff, but to work overtime or to change shifts.
This is not yet an industrial action.
It is a normal thing, from a health and safety point of view, for every employee to take care of regular working hours and only do them.
JHL opposes the government's intention to lighten the protection of small companies from dismissal.
The labour market manager of municipal employers, Markku Jalonen, does not make a preliminary assessment of the effects of the overtime and shift change bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, even though the services can be weakened.
Employers across Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations that can be done.
The area is so huge, the social and health services and the technical sector that it is hard to say.
The impacts can vary very much by industry, region and employers," Jalonen said to STT.
Jalonen says that last week there were already experiences of three days of similar actions, such as those of the District and Founder's Association Super and the Social and Health Union Tehy.
Their effects were quite limited.
JHL's ban on overtime and shift change applies to employees from municipalities, church, state, and private social and health care sectors, among others.
Family day care providers, for example, are excluded.
At this stage, the industrial battle concerns nearly 100,000 JHL members.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL's actions may take a long time.
The Federation is also prepared for other industrial action, if the preparation of the Employment Act continues.
The government should now admit that we are running into a wall and hard.
In Jalonen's view, both the Ay movement and the government must meet.
The thing about this is that the hard ones are already in the barrel, even though the show has not yet been given, says Jalonen.
Large Coral Reef is born with the strength of children and adults - in the fitness circles of the show, they study the gestures of skate and sea horse
Last spring in Hamburg, the Great Coralliriutta, was premiered in another facility, and last Saturday it was performed for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the previous works of the group, the Great Coral reef is a work that is built from beginning to end together with the audience.
This time, however, a more clear-cut presentation will also be built, which will refresh and encapsulate the observations made in the initial exercises.
There is a lot of fairy tale-like magic in theatre play for the children's participants as well.
The child's perspective has already been included in the preparation of the work.
However, the Great Coral Reef is not a children's show, but a show that adults and children do in cooperation.
It gives adults information and observations about how children receive information and make art.
The ability of children to throw themselves into practices and common games also dissolves the distance between adults and children.
In fact, the great Coral reef is somewhat similar to the fairytale, fitness and nature-related information, but it is finally tuned around the visits in other, non-human conditions.
The large coral reef begins with the introduction of corals and coral reefs to the motion courses of living organisms and fish.
In six different fitness districts, the gestures of skate and sea horse, among others, are learned.
Finally, there will be a performance of less than an hour in which music, lights, shiny paints and costumes will help you get to know the life of the coral reef.
There are both diving people in the Great Coral Reef who observe the life of the coral reef and the corals that are being considered.
In addition, there are organisms that look at corals.
Views and observations in many directions make the show dense and life-prone.
Whether to be a landscape of an organism, a landscape-viewing organism, and another living organism or landscape - and all of this at the same time.
For children, it does not seem difficult.
In other spaces, the group's practices aim to reach the line of thinking and action, which is challenging when the group is made up of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more significant.
After the workshop, Sitratori will host a silent demonstration on behalf of endangered corals.
The destruction beyond human understanding should not be allowed to harden, even though it might be difficult to comprehend the significance of exercising one's own compassion in front of the sights of destruction.
Other facilities have built their works in such a way that it respects the diversity of life, including through a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are other kinds of consciousness, other species and their future generations, whose wonder and play it will clear up.
Children grow up too quickly - I'm glad there were no smartphones in my childhood
Today's children and young people are becoming more irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking all the time when they are younger and younger.
I think children should be children throughout their childhood, not messing up their lives because of drugs and sex, because others say they do.
I was overwhelmed when my friend told me he had to pick up his fifth-grade sister over the weekend from the "boyfriend."
When she came to pick up her drunk sister, she told about her sex experiences that night.
I couldn't possibly imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we've been told and warned throughout our childhood that you can't touch drugs and sex is a grown-up thing.
I hope that today's children will be able to live a decent childhood, and they won't have to grow up too early because of group pressure from friends.
I keep seeing younger girls in Instagram who are wearing makeup and revealing their clothes.
Snapchat is used to take and send images that reveal in the evening.
It's harder to guess how old girls are.
Today's 13-year-olds can easily look like 18-year-olds and even parents.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad there were no smartphones in my childhood.
I got to be a child for many years, and I didn't have to think about what others think about me.
Yle: Authorities told the government that the case of Airisto's Helmi has nothing to do with national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, interviewed by Yle, the protection police and the military went to inform the defence and foreign affairs committees earlier this week.
The Finnish government has been told that the investigation of Airisto's Helmet is not currently related to national security, but to organised crime, reported Yle.
The information from the anonymous sources was confirmed to Yle by Ilkka Kanerva, Chairman of the Defence Committee (OK).
According to Kanerva, the military and the protection police visited the defence and foreign affairs committees this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is primarily seen as a financial crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that there was anything else, Kanerva commented in Yle's interview.
According to Yle's information, there has been no evidence of a link to national security so far, but the investigation is still under way.
There is no way to know what can be revealed there yet, one of Yle's interviewees says.
A week ago, extensive home searches in the Turku archipelago and the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is just a financial crime or a threat to Finland's internal security.
Earlier this week, the Iltalehti compiled an article that reviews claims both for and against.
Video: Dream goal saved Liverpool's losing series
Liverpool's 100 percent start of the Champion League was finished, but it was still a more satisfied team to 1-1 tie on Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday it will be exactly one year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran away to a 1-0 guest victory.
Then Pep Guardiola's combination sent a signal to the whole Valioliika that City was now serious.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And certainly Liverpool manager Jörgen Klopp arrived in West London with the same idea.
The Reds had started the Champions League with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool started more strongly, and especially Virgil van Dijk seemed to be in control of his own field end alone.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had Wednesday's great league cup away from Anfield Road.
That's when Eden Hazard got off the bench to solve the match with a great individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was in on it from the very beginning.
At the 25th minute, he first played in a small space with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho in a triangular game.
Finally, the Croat saw Hazard dive forward and sent him a fully weighted pass.
Hazard drifted a bit to the edge of the penalty area, but bombed the perfect left leg bet in the rear corner.
Pool's brass guard, Alisson, was a bit slow in his fight, and all he could get was his finger on the ball.
Klopp must have felt the defeat position lightly unfair, because almost immediately after, Antonio Rüdiger cleaned Mo Salah's direction from the finish line.
During the second period, Chelsea-veskar Kepa also got real action.
The Basque watcher reacted quickly to Sadio Mané's bet and pushed the ball from the base of the pole to an angle kick.
At the other end, Alisson, by throwing himself through Hazard, zeroed.
The guests' best place came in 72 minutes when James Milner found Bobby Firmino with his focus.
But the brass star's bull was directed toward national teammate David Luiz, who saved the leadership of the hosts.
Even that did not last for the 89th minute, when replacement Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot for 25 metres.
Sturridge played in his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed the top corner of an irresistible bet in its honor.
Liverpool's 100 percent league start came to an end with a 1-1 tie, but it's still at the top of the league - together with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also closely involved in the championship with two points behind the top.
In the clock shift discussion, the potets are deep
I remember a few decades ago a newspaper asked a variety of Finnish influences what divides the Finnish people.
Juice Widkinen's answer remained the only one left in mind: the Nen terminal.
Some people's last name has a nun terminal and some don't.
There could be divisions anywhere, and there was one offer.
In the EU, Finland has brought about the abolition of the annual clock shift.
A lot of people agree that the shift of clocks twice a year has been the job of fools and has caused a variety of problems.
In the end, this achievement at least seems to be the easiest stage of the solution in Finland, even though it hasn't been easy.
The hardest thing now is to decide what time it will end up at: the current summer or winter season, or some other time zone.
The people can also express their opinion about this on the otakanta.fi page.
The survey has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open until Friday, October 12.
The discussion is intense in coffee tables and social media, and everyone has their say.
Those who defend winter time justify their position with the effect of morning light on people's well-being and summer time, with the effect of evening light, defend people's desire to walk and, consequently, their well-being.
Both sides have strong supporters and good arguments.
Even studies show that morning light rhythmizes people's day and gives them freshness.
On the other hand, if you don't especially suffer from a wake-up in the dark, the light will increase people's outdoors and give you better opportunities to do, for example, autumn yard work.
The number of extra lights after a normal working day has already been calculated to his class.
I'd rather have both, but unfortunately for our location in the north corner of the earth, we can't help it.
Winters are too dark and summers too bright for many anyway.
A typical discussion of the subject is that one's own view is being driven and the other's views are being strongly opposed.
The opposing party's arguments are hardly listened to, because the most important thing is how you feel about it.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on the matter, there is little point in trying to turn the other person's head.
It's a waste of gunpowder.
The topic is terribly easy to debate, because it does not require a great deal of effort and it is enough to justify a mutation.
There is usually the steepest and equally infertile argument about similar types of things.
It is a shame if the wrong option is chosen, but I think we can adapt to that too.
And it always offers a suitable scapegoat, if life feels sad.
Josba fought a close guest victory
Josba's first guest game in the hall band in Divar produced a full three points against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba went home from Seinäjoki with a joyous 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Nurmo still led with the goal in the beginning of the third period, but Josba applied for compositions and recycled men in chains.
In the time of 50.47, Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi plotted a 6-5 win goal.
Both teams were on hold for crucial minutes at the level.
Josba's most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was fire-powered anyway, when Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Miika Kosonen (1+0) also played in the second chain at the time of her goal.
After three laps, Josba has six points.
Next up, O2-Jyväskylä will be visiting in two weeks.
Eno's church's 200th anniversary on Sunday
The 200th anniversary of Eno's church will be celebrated tomorrow Sunday in some very sad moods.
The extermination of the church in the heat hazard a week ago was a shock.
Eno's church was also guarded two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still a celebration.
Even if no one wanted to, Eno's church is now the oldest church in the Joensuu Parish Union.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been Eno's heart despite the municipal and other connections around the world.
Family Mass begins in Eno's church today at 10 o'clock.
After that, we move to the parish hall by the Karelian table.
There are all kinds of things in and out of the show all day.
For example, you can get to know the church building with Ari Räsänen, who has retired for 37 years as parish master.
The church's birth celebration also marks the end of an era.
The parish hall, built in 1982, has already been decommissioned, keeping its doors open today for the last time.
Now we are in evasive spaces at the old municipal hall, says Kappa-based Markku Koistinen.
The parish house was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has been standing healthy for 200 years.
Elon Musk resigns from the chair of Tesla's board - The charges of fraud were settled for $40 million
Tesla, an electric car manufacturer, and Elon Musk, the CEO of the company, have settled their lawsuits with the SEC, the US Securities Market Supervisor.
The SEC suspected Musk was guilty of securities fraud, and Musk was in danger of being sidelined as a result of the company he created.
However, Musk is allowed to continue as Tesla's CEO.
Instead, Musk will have to step down from the chair of Tesla's board for three years.
The company has to hire an outside board chairman.
Musk will also be subject to stricter supervision.
According to the contract, Tesla will have to hire two independent leaders and will be more closely monitoring Muski's communications.
In addition, Tesla and Musk both pay $20 million (about €17 million) to settle the case.
"The purpose of the decision is to prevent new market disruptions and harm to Tesla's shareholders," said director Steven Peikin of the SEC.
The case started in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might withdraw the company from the stock market.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding is secured.
The tweet temporarily raised Tesla's share price.
The SEC suspected Musk was guilty of securities fraud.
According to the agency, the tweet was false and misleading, and Musk had not talked about the arrangement with the company's other management or potential funders.
In practice, the agency accused Muski of misleading investors.
The SEC announced on Friday that it would sue the company and Muski.
The SEC said it demanded that Musk be fined and banned from running any more listed companies.
The SEC's challenge frightened the investors, and Tesla's share went into a sharp decline.
More than 800 people died in Indonesia's quake and tsunami
The number of deaths from the Indonesian earthquake and the subsequent tsunami has risen to at least 832, according to the country's disaster agency AFP.
The number of deaths is still expected to increase, as the damage is still to be solved.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure could rise to thousands.
Friday's earthquake raised a tsunami that attacked the town of Palu on the island of Sulawes.
Tsunam was given a warning immediately after the quake, but it was quickly cancelled.
According to the authorities, almost all known deaths are at least for the time being from Prausa.
The rescue services are concerned about, among other things, the Donggala area near the centre of the earthquake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Already several people are known to die.
From the ruins calls for help
The Indonesian army has been alerted to help rescue workers seek victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived in the disaster area today, urged the soldiers to continue the rescue work day and night untiringly.
One of the central points of the rescue work is the Palu hotel, where it is believed that there are still 50-60 people in the ruins.
Muhammad Syagi, head of the rescue agency, said that one person could be dug alive in the night from the ruins of Roa-Roa hotel favoured by business travellers.
We also heard people calling for help, he said.
According to Syaug, heavy cleaning equipment would quickly be needed in the earthquake and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing loved ones.
Help, you in Palu and nearby.
My friend's family members are still missing, one writer appealed to Facebook group.
Politicians phone numbers leaked to troublemakers in Britain
Many British politicians were harassed as their contacts were leaked because of the shortcomings in the app's encryption.
The troublemakers were able to access, among other things, the ministers' telephone numbers.
It was an application used by the British Conservative Party Assembly in the government.
For example, Michael Gove, Minister of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, were harassed.
Several MPs received harassment calls.
Due to the lack of encryption of the application, the audience was able to access the politicians' profiles in the mobile app of the Conservative Party's annual meeting.
The audience had access to the profiles using the politician's email address, which was easily available online.
The person signing in to the profile was able to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed for a moment to change Boris Johnson's profile picture to a porn image and title to insulting.
The profile picture of Michael Goven was changed to a picture of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows people to log into other people's profiles with their email addresses.
Then the loginer can view the profile person's contact details and send messages in their name.
The meeting application made every reporter, politician and participant's phone number public, Foster criticised.
The Conservative spokesman apologized for the leak.
He said the technical problems have been solved and the application now works safely.
British information agency ICO supports the leak.
The application was made by an Australian company called Crown Comms.
The Labour Party in opposition criticises the fact that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted on security issues.
Every week, the audience of The Wall Suomi will have a large group of applauding Poles
Watchful viewers drew attention to the reactions of the studio audience in The Wall Suomi.
The fast-spread U.S. format, The Wall, landed in Finland last Saturday at Number Four.
The game show, hosted by Heikki Paasonen, has been filmed in Poland in the same studio, where other international productions in the format are made.
In the Polish studio, the filming possibilities were exceptional, as the large 12-metre-high wall of the format required space from the farm.
During the start period, the social media highlighted the programme's studio audience, which was guessed to be Polish.
On Twitter, the discussion was about whether the Poles sitting in the studio might understand anything about the game to play in Finnish.
Unne Sormunen, head of domestic programs in Number Four, illustrates the matter to Iltalehti.
He says that there are close players, other Finns, expatriates living in Poland, and just Polish viewers in the studio audience.
The audience is made up of international patters in Finnish production, just like the audiences of The Wall in the same production space in other countries.
There are also such groups in Finland, so-called professional audiences, who go to the descriptions of different programs, says Sormunen.
He reminds that following the game in itself is not so difficult to understand, even if he does not understand the language in which it is played.
Red and green balls falling from the wall are easy to distinguish from each other.
However, there are interpreters in the studio for foreign-language speakers who do the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret what happens to the studio director as a simultanical interpretation.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells what kind of flap they throw there, for example, and what's going on, says Sormunen.
He compares the situation with the way David Hasselhoff was recently delivered in domestic production.
A few years ago, David Hasselhoff was involved in the shoots of the Talent Finland at our home in Finland.
He was constantly getting simultanic interpretation in his ear, and he knew everything that was said in the shoots in Finnish, the sum of Sormunen.
The typhoon, which is sulking south of Japan, is moving towards the main islands - officials warn of landslides and flooding
Authorities also warn against possible landslides and floods.
Taifuni Tram has injured at least 50 people, but the authorities say that large injuries have been avoided and so far there is no information about the deaths.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so strong that it has turned the cars around.
According to the NHK radio company, people have been evacuated to shelters and power has been cut by over 300,000 households.
More than a thousand flights have been cancelled, and bullet trains are in some places stalled because of the storm.
The storm is expected to strike near Osaka around half a day in Finnish time.
The capital Tokyo is not directly on the path of the storm, but there will also be heavy winds and rains.
Train shifts have been cancelled in Tokyo today.
According to weather scientists, Trami torments Japan until Monday.
The sky of the Ässä became even darker
The early days of the Ässä have been bad.
The sky was already darkened almost as soon as the team lost 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1) to Vaasa Sport on Saturday.
The Poris now have five consecutive losses, and the total score for the six rounds is two.
No Ässie defender or two lower chain players have scored yet.
Pressures are also growing all the time.
As far as Sport was concerned, almost half of the game was gone from the hall.
Six games have just been played, and there is of course no reason to give up.
Of course, you have to worry, because that's what we didn't play very well.
Especially the second round was shamefully bad, Jarno Kärki said, who did 1+2 for Äss.
Sport naturally had a taste for victory.
The team had a game below from Friday, so it would have been seen in making it.
Maybe it did, but Aces couldn't take advantage of it.
Bread day visitors continued to grow
Bread Day Mother Pirkko Hyvärinen marvels at the number of audiences in the big hall.
Somehow you thought maybe this year there wouldn't be this many people," Hyvärinen ponders in the morning.
In the autumn of 2017, the Finnish Tractor's Championships were organised at the same time as Bread Day, so perhaps the expectations would be that the audience could even drop slightly from the previous year.
However, it was different; the corridors were already blocked briskly before 10, the sellers said the products ran out, news porridge was sold more than before, and even in the number of cars, Hyvärinen heard there was an increase.
The estimated number of visitors has been about 6,000, says Hyvärinen later in the afternoon.
In the five hours of the morning and afternoon, there was a particularly large amount of programme for families with children, which I think attracted them to a lot of records.
In addition, Hyvärinen estimates that the event will reach even longer.
The sellers also curve to Liper every year from a bigger area.
This year, nearly a hundred rapporteurs, handicrafts, pastries and harvesters had arrived at the breadkeeper.
The bread day mother, Pirkko Hyvärinen, admired the crowd from the hall stands.
The harvest was blessed at the beginning of the bread day.
In the children's series, Teija Kiviniemi's beautiful bread won an audience vote.
Eleven different forms of bread arrived at the children's bread competition.
Marjatta Vepsäläinen, the winner of the Rye Bread competition, spent the day in a pie shop.
7 x the most beautiful lamp - this is where you recognize a good lamp
Bring the space to life, create the right atmosphere for the interior, and read the book without getting tired of the eyes.
It is worth investing in good lighting.
We gathered three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were given by Innolux' sales and marketing director Tarja Jokiniemi.
Do a favor to your eyes
The importance of lighting grows, the more years it has passed.
Adequate light can help with the problems that many people face as they get older, as the visual accuracy is reduced and the dazzle is more and more affected.
The need for light also grows as a parent.
A 60-year-old needs three times more light than a 20-year-old.
So it is worth investing in the effects and properties of light for health reasons.
A good light gives enough light, but it doesn't dazzle, Jokiniemi hints.
Create beauty around you
Only the right lighting solutions can be used to display the beautiful interior.
The decorator of the moment can afford to choose.
There is a non-viable japandi style that combines Scandinavian and Japanese.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style, with its strong colours, metal with different shades or ice cream colours, has also been inspired by the 1970s.
Authenticity fascinates like other home decorations.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Show Your Personality
On the other hand, more is being invested in the home now than before, and the interior has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, they want to have a custom-made, even bold lighting that has a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products, whose origin and designer are known.
So let's be well-designed, says Jokiniemi.
The home doesn't necessarily get the latest trend light, but a timeless classic for which many years have been saved.
Some types of timeless, jewelryy and elegant classics hold their ground year after year, says Jokiniemi.
Thank you and good-bye!
KooKoo showed the door to a Canadian attacker after three games
KooKoo and the attacker Brendan O'Donnell's roads split.
The Canadian attacker played three League matches in orange black without power points, KooKoo says in his statement.
O'Donnell moved to KooKoo in August with a one-year contract, which included a probationary period until the end of September.
Last season, a 26-year-old attacker played in the KHL in Kunlund Red Star and in the KHL farm in VHL in KRS Heilongjiang.
There's no news of O'Donnell's new company yet.
The player wants to set an example in recycling - goods go to the world in recycling boxes, plastic changed to paper
Pelimies now recycles not only the games, but also packaging materials.
The customers' products are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
The products ordered online are packed, for example, in packages from importers.
All the packages that come to us go for reuse.
We may use the boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is in the condition that it can be used," says Ville Puurula of the Pelican Man in Oulu.
As a padding material, the company mainly uses newspapers and similar recycling materials.
Bubble plastic is avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we are supposed to move on to recycled materials even in envelopes.
The movement wants to set an example for others.
According to Puurula, recycling is not an extra effort.
It's not a big problem to start recycling.
There will also be financial savings when, for example, cardboard packages are reused.
The recycling is natural for Pelimies, because in addition to new products, the core range of products in the store includes, among other things, used games and equipment.
Gaining everyone who is fashion conscious: One and the same shirt works in every outfit
Classic clothes work in costume from season to season.
With their versatility, they create the foundation of a good garderob, because it is easy to put together different outfits at an affordable price around high-quality classics.
In the autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality knits.
This category also includes black polo.
A black sweater made of natural material with turtlenecks cannot be a mistake.
You can combine the clothes with straight pants, tuxedo and jeans, and you can create both a subdued outfit and a snotty style around it.
Pooloneule is suitable for both a youthful modern dresser and a classically sophisticated stylist.
This is how you create style.
The autumn trend look comes from gold brown and wide-legged corduroy pants, black turtleneck and grey ankles.
The classic turtleneck, together with the other classics, the blue-green scone skirt and the wine-red Loafers, form a feminine and sophisticated outfit.
Bring a edge to a black turtleneck by combining it with casually trendy garments: jeans, high boots, and thick tights.
Young and stylish!
Russian intelligence services have a long tradition of sabotage
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence SVR or military intelligence GRU has abandoned this course of action.
During the Soviet era, the so-called DRG groups specialised in sabotage operations.
The name comes from the Russian-speaking words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaja gruppa: sabotage and intelligence group.
The agents of the Soviet security service in the West of the KGB have already drawn up detailed plans for important sabotage sites, says the KGB's archivist Vasili Mitroh (1922-2004).
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s
The targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, the KGB acquired for DRG groups a Bundeswehr, railways, game guards and road workers uniforms and accessories for covert operations.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed in local Ukrainian police riot equipment, set up checkpoints on roads leading from the peninsula to Ukraine, and isolated Crimea from their mother country.
The Cold War agents hid supplies of mines, explosives, detonators and communication equipment for sabotage groups in the terrain.
Even in 1998 a KGB stash was found in Switzerland, the trap mine of which exploded when the authorities sprayed it with a water cannon.
Police reached four drunk drivers in the county last night
The police caught four drunk drivers across North Karelia on the night between Friday and Saturday.
In Joensuu, an 18-year-old man from Kontiolahti blew 1,57 per mil.
He drove around 4:30 a.m. at the beginning of Kajaanintie with two passengers.
A 19-year-old local man who was alone in the car blew 1.54 per mil according to the police.
There were no serious injuries during the exit.
A 20-year-old outdoor man driving a passenger car in the centre of Outokumpu blew 1.33 per mil into the alkometer.
The police suspect the male drivers concerned for aggravated drunken driving and the Polvijärvi driver for endangering road safety.
On Saturday morning in Tuupovaara, at the intersection of Öllöläntie and Hoikantie, a 36-year-old man with a local van blew 0.52 per mil.
He's a suspect in a DUI.
Police are asking for observations about the stabbing at the Turku railway station after midnight.
According to the police, the man was beaten in the parking lot in front of the station with life-threatening consequences.
The act was recorded on the security camera.
The dark-haired suspects, wearing dark pants and brown or beige jacket, were immediately removed by a dark station wagon in the direction of the bus station on Ratapihankatu.
One of the suspects took a bicycle to the direction of Humalistonkatu downtown.
A pedestrian died after being hit by a bus in Pori
In Pori, a pedestrian died early on Saturday morning after a bus hit him.
The accident happened after 4 a.m. in Raumantie at Niittumaa.
The bus driver is not suspected of a crime.
Police are investigating the events that led to the accident.
HPK keeps Risk in its ranks for the rest of the season, Lehtinen's probation period ended
Mika Toivola, sports director of Hämeenlinna's HPK, says that Philip Riska (central) has been important to the team in the start-ups, in the underpower play and in the defensive role of field four.
Filip Riska, who played in the early autumn, will continue in Hämeenlinna's HPK for the rest of the season.
The success of experienced Riska, 33, in the roles offered to him convinced the club management.
Filip has been an important piece for us in the beginnings, in the underpower play and in the defensive role of field four.
Even though there is still something to improve, it is good for the young team to hold onto a player that has experienced this way, says HPK sports director Mika Toivola in the club's press release.
According to Toivola, Riska's value will rise when playing hockey League's solution games.
Riska, a backer from Pietarsaari, has played league hockey earlier in JYP, Luko and Sport.
Instead, Mr Lehtinen was left without a contract after the probationary period.
A true story on TV today: The climber was left to die twice
American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on a man's own experience.
The film of the evening is based on them.
Everest is now premiered on Finnish television.
In May 1996, a devastating blizzard surprised climbers on Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákuri's 2015 guidance is about a survival battle that has been handled a lot.
The tragedy has been made into films and documents before.
True events are also being discussed in this case.
Twenty-two years ago, the world's tallest mountain took the lives of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced expedition leaders: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who was the guide to Weathers.
Weathers' life could be saved by an eye surgery performed before going to Nepal.
As a result of that and the air pressure, he lost his vision, which is why the conquest of the top had to be missed.
Rob Hall moved on and didn't come back.
But Weathers' struggle for life and death had only just begun.
When the storm came, he got lost and couldn't find his way back to the camp.
When they came looking for him, they found him in such a bad condition that they didn't believe in survival.
Weathers was left to die.
But by a miracle, he got back on his feet and found the others.
The badly frozen Weathers were thought to still be dying, and once again he was left to his own devices.
Clearly, contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even climbers began to believe in the possibility of being given help.
In the film, Beck Weathers is played by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
The 200-year-old Eno Church has been celebrated today
Eno's 200-year-old church has been celebrated today on the church hill.
The church was dedicated on October 4, 1818, and in celebration of the centenary, the whole family's festival was prepared for Sunday.
The party started in Eno's church hill at 10 a.m. at the family fair, after which Karelian dinner table has been served at Eno parish hall.
The church was full.
517 people attended the family fair.
Eno's pastor Armi Rautavuori was glad that so many people had come to church.
It will be a great joy for a long time to come and will give strength to the work, says Rautavuori (in the picture).
Many have been touched by the fire of the church in the heat of the fire, and it was not ignored at the 200th anniversary of the Eno parish.
Eno's church is now the oldest in Joensuu Evangelical Lutheran parishes since the church of Kiitösvaara was destroyed in the fire.
The wooden church in Kiintysvaara was completed in 1770.
In the morning, there was a rosary, where the church that was destroyed in the fire was silenced and remembered.
Photos and videos: The Medican flashed its power in Greece - The sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A powerful hurricane-like autumn storm crashed from lunch to Greece on Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane has been named Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red weather warning to the regions of Attika, Peloponnesos, Ionian Islands, Kyclades and Crete.
The photos from the area show plenty of flooding around Greece.
A video published on Twitter shows that between houses in the city of Kiato, in the Korinthia region, has suddenly appeared instead of the street because of the flooding of the river.
The second video shows how the car has been transported by floodwaters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese peninsula, a heavy wind caused a strong ocean.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens instructs people on their Facebook pages to prepare for the storm in Greece.
The delegation urges you to follow weather reports and local authorities' instructions.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medican, brings heavy rains and even flood risks.
According to CNN, a study published in 2011 showed that medicaments occur only once or twice a year in the world, typically around September and October, when the sea temperature is still high.
The storm now blowing left floods in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey north and towards Europe.
There are also refugee camps in Greece, such as Lesbos, that have caused concern.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to proper protection.
Also in the summer, the areas destroyed by the fires will be hit by the storm around Athens.
A medic also raged in Greece last November.
There is no need to go to the sea now, but flights are on schedule - thousands of Finns are currently on holiday in the Greek islands threatened by the autumn storm
The trips to the sea are cancelled, and even as you walk, you should be careful not to fly branches or other bulk in a storm.
Such instructions have been distributed by the guides to a good 3,500 Finnish holidayers in Greece via Sunimatkat on the weekend.
The instructions will come in handy, as even the cyclone Zorbas has been predicted to beat the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, in the vicinity of the island of Crete, wind speed can rise to as much as 45 metres per second in a gust.
The harsh rains add to the bad weather.
All those travelling to Greece via Sun Tours and Tui from Finland who have reported their phone numbers have been warned about hard winds by SMS, according to tour operators.
Still in the air sun and warmth
According to Sun Travel Communications expert Inka Ikonen, by Saturday evening, holiday destinations have avoided the worst.
For example, flights have landed and risen according to the normal schedule.
Of course we're watching the situation all the time.
Safety ahead of you.
Supported media caller Antonia Schroderus says their flights have also been on schedule.
We are in constant contact with our staff on the target.
At least Crete was still calm, he told about the early evening on Saturday.
There are currently more than 1,500 Finnish passengers in the most popular Greek islands, Rodos and Crete.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are on holiday in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos is expected to reach Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, the sun had flashed and the temperature went to 27 degrees, says Ikonen.
Zorbas is estimated to be the next Turkish nuisance, albeit slightly less severe.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, for example checking the number of Finns who flew to Antalya Tui, says Schroderus.
Shirley Karvinen and Janni Huss have completely identical evening costumes at the Missi final - this is how they react to the situation
Media persona and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Suomi final on Saturday in an open-back evening dress.
Hussi says she got a dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals who found me a really great dress for tonight, Hussi smiles.
The exact same silver evening dress was also chosen by the host Shirley Karvinen.
The two also noticed the same outfit and looked at the situation with laughter.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanom he was in a hurry to prepare, and he had to get ready on the plane.
Hussi is a backstage and red carpet driver at the Missifinal, and she is talking to the front-row stars who arrive.
Huss has recently moved from Kamp to Jätkäsaari on Friday
I'm going to stay there for now, see what happens.
The essential thing is that the new apartment has its own office, Hussi said.
Before moving, Hussi was on holiday alone in Greece.
It was wonderful, I was just staying in a hotel for a week without going anywhere.
When stress erupted, I got the flu, but otherwise the holiday was really a success, says Hussi.
Shirley Karvise's behaviour on the plane attracted a lot of attention - gathering the curious eyes of pensioners
The host and Miss Finland Shirley Karvinen of 2016 told Miss Suomi that she had enough to do with the radio broadcasts and Love Island Suomi photos on the red carpet of the final.
There has been so much haste that Garfield arrived at the finals directly from Finnair flight.
I put on makeup and put my hair on the plane.
This is glamour.
The evening dress change at home, Garfield laughs.
Karvinen says he pulled his makeup out among pensioners.
His preparation also attracted the attention of fellow passengers.
I had a big mirror and saw people looking in the mirror.
My makeup was funny, at least for the rest of us.
Garfield flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen says he enjoyed his job as a host of Love Island Finland.
He describes his experience as also stopping so far.
Karvinen says he went to say hello to the singles on Friday.
It's kind of brutal.
They are people's real feelings, Garfield describes the singles' feelings of the show.
How do I put on my upper knee boots?
Three perfect example costumes
Classic clothes are garments that work in costumes from season to season.
The classics are often decades old, but sometimes even more modern individuals can be included.
A few years ago, the overpile boots, which became hit shoes during the autumn and winter season, have not gone anywhere.
The boots over the knee, according to their name, are repeated in style from year to year and from season to season.
Showy boots share users' opinions, but a bold model should be tried, well - bravely.
After all, the upper knee boots are really suitable for any outfit.
Whether it's a jeans, lace, tully or tight, the simple leather or artificial leather surface of the boots works.
The long boots look good both in the party look and in the everyday outfits.
Black upper knee boots fit well even in delicate outfits.
They properly balance the femininity of a pink, flowery plier skirt and a delicate, bountiful sweater.
A fresh but autumnly stylish everyday dress for a romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro-spirited outfit comes from a long copper brown velvet, over knee boots, impressive earrings and a staple bag.
Even though there is a certain subtlety in the over knee boots, they also fit perfectly in a relaxed everyday dress, together with a t-shirt, long shorts and a trendy cap.
Wonderfully easy and yet so stylish!
Two robot cars start operating in Espoo
They will travel for the rest of the year and pick up passengers, the City of Espoo informs.
Otaniemi robot cars play the role of a bus simulator, as next spring the area is scheduled to start traffic on a robot bus.
The project will develop and pilot all-year-round robotic vehicle traffic and test the technical performance of the vehicles in Finnish conditions.
The experiment will find out how robot cars are coping with the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says traffic manager Johanna Nyberg.
For the first time, robot cars run completely automatically among the rest of the traffic without special traffic arrangements.
The safety of vehicles is always the responsibility of the passenger on board.
The vehicles constantly sense their environment with several different sensors and assess whether the driveway is open.
If it isn't, they will interpret whether a vehicle, a bicycle or, for example, a snowflake has been detected, says Harri Santamala, the CEO of the robotic transport company, Sensible 4.
Robot cars travel all autumn three days a week: Tuesdays between 1 pm and 3 pm, Wednesdays between 10 am and 3 pm, and Thursdays between 10 am and 3 pm.
Robot cars stop at six stops along the route and pick up passengers.
The stops of robot cars are identified by stop markings.
The bus is most secure from Otakaari stop number 1.
The bass player of the band Mokoma fell off stage in the middle of the gig and was injured
On their Facebook page, the Mokoma group announces an unexpected situation at the Tampere Pakkahuone gig.
Mokoma's gig in Tampere's Pakkkahuonea took a dramatic turn on Saturday, when bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell from the stage in the middle of the performance.
It happened when the band was playing the last song of the evening.
The twilight's wrist was broken.
The band informs about this on their Facebook page.
"We're alive!"
Last night, Santtu tripped from the stage at the Packroom in the last song and broke his wrists.
Let's hope for a quick recovery for a metal brother!
The rest of the tour's gigs are done with an alternate, the website says.
Mokoma's fans are concerned about the image update, where bassist Santtu lies with a cast in his hand on the bed.
This news has been expected, it was a bit of a worry that how bad it happened.
The relief is great, and the bones are fortunate to heal over time.
Take it easy and get over it quickly to Santu and have a good tour for the rest of the band plus a replacement!
And thanks for yesterday, it was a great gig, but you promise to leave such a strong drama out of the end of the gigs in the future? writes a fan.
Police supervised hunting in North Karelia and Savo
On Friday and Saturday, the Eastern Finland Police Department carried out hunting surveillance with Metsähallitus and the Finnish game centre in North Karelia and Ylä-Savo, and the police department's ex-customers reported in social media on Saturday.
The main focus of the surveillance was on the legality and licensing of hunting.
Every hunter was inspected with a hunting card and a hunting permit required on state land.
In addition, the possession permits for hunting weapons and the permitted quantities of self-charged chicken fortification weapons were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the surveillance, and only one hunter was found missing the required hunting permit.
The hunter was fined 12 days for an unauthorised request.
In addition, the police blew up 133 vehicle drivers, and two of them are suspected of driving.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic offences in a fine procedure, the police once.
To sum up, the hunters follow the hunting's permission very well.
Many hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
One hunter said that "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone checked the permits."
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue to monitor hunting in the autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
Mykkänen will go to Turkey to monitor the selection of Syrian quota refugees
In the next few days, Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkänen will travel to Turkey to monitor the selection of quota refugees arriving in Finland.
It has been decided to take 530 Syrian refugees to Finland this year from Turkish refugee camps.
Selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year, including representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy and the police.
The delegation is already doing interviews in Turkey.
The UN Refugee Organisation (UNHCR) first selects people who are particularly vulnerable.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be particularly in need in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, disabled and sick, women and children.
More people will be selected for the group coming to Finland than there are in the quota, because in practice some will not arrive for different reasons.
He will also meet with the Turkish Minister of the Interior, Süleyman Soylu, on his journey, and non-governmental organisations operating on the Syrian border.
Ilkka Salmi, Chief of Staff at the Ministry of the Interior, is also involved.
There was talk of raising the quota
Finland has been taking quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees a year.
The quota was 1,050 a year for a couple of years, but since then there has been no agreement in the board about raising it.
The Coalition Party has been in favour of increasing the quota, but the project has last fallen into blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) recently proposed a gradual increase in the quota to between 1 500 and 2 000 people a year.
During this reign, Mykkänen's visit will be the first one the Minister of the Interior will make on-site to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The previous interior ministers Petteri Orpo (Co.) and Paula Risikko (Co.) were able to move on to their new tasks before the visits were arranged.
Finland will receive €10,000 from the EU for every refugee in a particularly vulnerable situation.
Now we're going off the rails - you don't know whether to cry or laugh anymore
Karjalainen reported last Saturday about a bill to amend the Animal Protection Act.
The article gave the impression that the bill basically prohibits the keeping of all animals that are not specifically permitted by ministerial regulations, as farm animals, pets or other business activities.
Therefore, everything else is, in principle, prohibited, except for the animals mentioned separately in the regulation.
If the bill ends up as a law, I think it means that we are rejecting in Western democracies the general principle that the law specifically prohibits activities that endanger the security or good practice of society.
Now, in principle, a ban is being imposed on any activity that is not expressly authorised by law or regulation.
The change means that nothing new can be tried in business, for example, and nothing else can be done until the law or regulation approving it has been passed.
The government's work in the drafting of the law in general has been weak.
If we now take the path that, in principle, everything is forbidden in Finland, which is not allowed separately, we no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I have no doubt that animal welfare law will require an update.
But this kind of legal project is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the constitution very well, but I wonder if it will approve of such a 'Everything is forbidden, which is not permitted by law or regulation.'
Hopefully, there will be some sensible minister who will interrupt the progress of such a legal project.
Metti Forssell tips: Four trendiest skirts in the autumn
This autumn's trendy clothing comes in the skin of a snake.
It looks especially good in skirts.
Merge a snake-tied skirt into a pair of more discreet upper parts, such as a polo or an ordinary t-shirt, to keep the outfit stylish.
This autumn you will see plenty of silk, and especially the silk skirt is one of the trendiest items in the season.
Connect a stunning silk skirt with a delicately feminine top or casually into a sweater as a pair.
You can play with a silk skirt more boldly and throw on shoes, for example, or autumn trendy cowboy boots.
It doesn't matter if it's gray, brown, or multi-tone, all the plaid skirts are now part of every woman's must-have.
Boldly combine different colors with each other, and play with the screens on the top of the screen, too.
For example, the combination of plaid and spherical is beautiful.
The asymmetric hems are a breeze from the lightness of the summer, which can be taken with them to autumn.
The asymmetrical hem is also feminine and playful, and it is perfect for everyday life and celebration.
Baby Alexia, 3 months, sulking sweetly in Jere's arms
In Karalahti's family photo, a sweet three-month-old baby Alexia comes into focus.
Nanna Karalahti tells about the Aito day care centre established for Kerava.
The sports entrepreneur Nanna Karalahti, 30, and the ex-ice hockey player Jere Karalahti, 43, received family additions in early July.
The couple's first son, Jax, turned 2 in May, while little Alexia is only a three-month-old baby.
Nanna Karalahti recently hosted a training camp with Martina Aitolehti in Marbella, Spain, where the whole Karalahti family was involved.
In Instagram, Nanna published a picture of the Spanish atmosphere, where the whole Karalahti family is posing.
Children Jax and Alexia are in the arms of their parents.
The sweetly sulking baby Alexia, resting in the arms of father Jere, draws attention.
Grateful for this.
Grateful for goodness, forgiveness, people's generosity and joy, writes Nanna Karalahti along with the family portrait.
Nanna Karalahti, who came out of the Fitness Diaries programme, and Jere Karalahti, an ex-ice hockey player, recently went into the kindergarten business and opened the Aito daycare centre for Kerava.
In addition to Karalahtis, the company includes food expert Johannes Laine and Hanna Liisantti, who is responsible for the educational side.
Johanna Tervo was hired as the head of the day care centre.
Turkey is urged to download mobile phones in case of a storm
The Zorba storm that blew in Greece on Saturday is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
On Saturday, meteorologists especially warned seamen, fishermen and farmers on the west coast of the country about the Greek storm, reports CNN Türk.
The tropical storm is reported to be moving along the coast from south to north during the day.
On Saturday, disaster and emergency authorities urged citizens to download their mobile phones before the storm and ensure internet access so people can get current updates, says Anadolu Ajansi, a local news agency.
People have been told to stay at home and away from the windows and move the garden furniture away from the wind, for example.
Turkey is expected to have heavy rain and the wind is expected to blow 28-33 metres per second.
In Greece, red weather warning
On Saturday, the Greek Meteorological Service gave a red weather warning to the regions of Attika, Peloponnesos, Ionian Islands, Kyclades and Crete in southern Greece.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and travel agents organising trips to Greece warned the Finns in Greece about the storm Zorba.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens also issued a storm warning.
Travellers were advised to follow weather reports and local authorities' instructions.
A short while ago, when I contacted you, the wind was hard and it rained.
People were calm, communication manager Laura Aaltonen from Tui Travel Agency told STT on Saturday.
Aaltonen described the situation as similar even on Saturday evening.
By evening, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not received any messages about the Finns in need either.
In Greece, many ports did not have ships operating on Saturday, said Amna, a local news agency.
The boat trips to the sea were cancelled on Saturday, telling STT about travel agents.
According to the Finnish Embassy in Athens, temporary disruptions to air and shipping were expected.
Finnair was told on Saturday that the weather situation is actively monitored.
Kimi Räikkönen summed up the cause of Mercedes' superiority over Ferrari
Ferrari Kimi Räikkönen was allowed to admit that the worst competitor, Mercedes, was too tough in Russia's GP time.
However, there is no reason to panic in the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver estimates.
They were just faster than us, but there's nothing huge about it.
Our car was the best in the whole weekend so far, but they were just too fast, fourth-run, and Räikkönen, who was clearly left behind with his teammate Sebastian Vettel, said.
Ferrari had a hard time already in the previous race in Singapore.
The rapper was asked what caused the sudden fall of Mercedes' ride.
They seem to be going faster than we are - that's how simple it is.
If I knew why, we'd probably go at the same rate they did.
But I don't know any more than anyone else.
This is always speculation, and they seem ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In the time-times, a rare treat was seen for Räikkönen's future stable, Sauber.
Next season on the Ferrari, the replacement Charles Leclerc was the seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also reached the final time session.
For a Swedish driver, the tenth place to leave is best in over three years.
And even though in the second driving session as many as five drivers did not drive altogether, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging for the future of Räikkönen?
Yes, if you compare it to where they were from the early season, it has been a big step forward.
There will be a different story next year, so let's see, let's see.
That was it - Robert Helenius knocked out Erka Teper: "Robbe is back"
The match between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper in Stuttgart evening was steady.
The German was a more protagonist in the ring, but he did not get a good hit.
Clearly, Helenius, who is more far-reaching, controls the match with his tough sets that found their way to the destination.
The Finn was also clearly in better physical condition than Teper.
The solution finally came in the eighth round, when Helenius knocked out Teper on his left straight.
The hit was so hard that the old man in front of the home crowd did not even try to get up from the carpet.
After the victory was confirmed, Helenius was quite moderate.
At the ring interview, he praised the good atmosphere created by the audience and his opponent at first.
Then he changed his language to Finnish for a moment.
Thank you to all viewers and Finnish cheerers.
We brought a belt today.
Helenius rejoiced immediately after the match.
It was a really big victory for Helenius' career.
There might even be a chance to get into the World Championship, Helenius commented to Iltalehti before the match.
Instead, the loss could have ended the whole boxing career.
Of course it's crossed my mind.
Helenius, who is 34 years old, admitted before the Teper encounter.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster can multiply
According to The Guardian, the vice president of the country calls for a clear rise in the number of victims.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims could rise to thousands.
Difficult circumstances
The rescuers are looking for the trapped and also the dead in the worst affected areas of the island of Sulawes: the port town of Palu and its neighboring town, Donggala.
So far, all the victims are Prausa, and the situation in Donggala is still unclear.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 have been badly injured.
There are still people in the oppressed buildings that the rescuers have not been able to get out.
For example, a hotel called Roa Roa in Palu has collapsed.
The rescuers say they heard screams from people trapped in the ruins, but the lack of cleaning equipment has delayed the start of rescue work.
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, has ordered the military to rescue and clean up.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, as electricity and communications in the disaster area are cut in many places.
The fuel reserves are also running out.
Miss Suomi finalist's hesitant response and long reflection caused a laughback
The new Miss Finland is currently being selected in Ruukki, Billnäs.
A question was asked to every Miss Finalist during the interview round.
The finalists drew the question about the glass bowl on the stage.
Especially the finalist number six, Emilia Anttikoski, 23, the hesitant response in the audience that was present produced sweet but benevolent laughs.
The question to Anttikoski had come through Facebook.
The user Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what the latest book was read by a misfit.
Anttikoski thought about his answer for a while before starting with hesitation.
Thank you for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read is..., Anttikoski said thinking.
A pause in reflection made the audience laugh, until Anttikoski continued to answer:
The last book I've read is...
I've read books in school!
Probably something about economics.
So the last book I've read is someone in economics," Anttikoski replied.
After his answer, Anttikoski received a loud applause from the audience, accompanied by laughter.
Earlier on Miss Anttikoski's tour attracted attention because she didn't want to pose in underwear because of her principle.
The 2018 Miss Finland will be crowned at 9 p.m. when last year's Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm gives up the crown.
Sike's apple pear cake takes the tongue away
This recipe is for you, who have good, acidic apples from behind, because the domestic apple is shockingly expensive in the shop.
You may have to buy a pear, even though it seems that a lot of people are already growing that pear tree.
This cake can only be made from apples if you don't want to buy a pear.
Of course, the taste is more varied if the cake also has its pear in it.
Peel the apples and pear and remove the seed homes.
Slicing.
Melt the butter in a pot.
Wrestle the eggs and sugar into foam and then add the corn flour and melt butter to the foam.
Merge the corn starch, or maizena, and baking powder, and add them to the dough.
Add almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Line the bread pan with baking paper, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the pan and spread the pear slices on top of the sugar.
Spoon half the dough on top of the pear slices and the apple blocks on top of the dough.
Spoon the rest of the dough over the apple blocks.
Cook in the oven at 180 degrees for about an hour until the surface is beautiful brown.
Allow to cool in the pan and then cancel the tray.
Cut the cake not until it is well cooled.
The cake is fragile in structure and is easily crushed because the dough contains almond and corn flour that does not contain gluten.
International crime literature event will be organised in Ruka in January
Kuusamo Ruka will host for the first time an international literary festival focusing on Nordic crime literature in January.
Nordic Noir's programme consists of interviews, panel discussions and other literature-related program numbers and jazz music.
The festival's literary guests include the Swedish duo Jerker Eriksson and Håkan Axlander Sundquist, who are behind the author's name Jens Lapidus and Erik Axel Sund.
In addition to Swedish names, there are also writers from Iceland, Norway and Finland.
The Finnish writers at the event are represented by Max Seeck.
According to the festival organisers, the northern location, nature, dark season and Kuusamo's unique environment provide a framework for unique literary experience.
Status symbols don't attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic or admired?
The researchers at Sydney University who analysed the matter have outlined two types of "coolness" of slightly different features: the generally attractive coolness and the opposite dissident coolness.
According to the researchers' description, the attractively cool people had many features that were considered socially desirable: outward-looking, friendly, harmonious, and qualified.
The dissidents, on the other hand, were characterized by distance, independence, insurrection and agility.
They thirsted for experience and paid little attention to external assessments.
Both types were combined with good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
Hardy's role is not long-term cool: high status in teens doesn't necessarily lead to success later in life.
That's what Child Development says about the U.S. study published in 2014.
Young people who were dating early, partying, looking for good-looking people and trying to be popular with others had an increased risk of substance abuse and crime as young adults.
In their relationships, they did less well than they did in the past with their more inconspicuous peers.
High-status ski cars, designer bags or watches don't make a person cool - or at least genuinely attractive.
In a study published in Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, most people were more prepared to make friends with people wearing a regular supermarket shirt than a brand shirt - despite the fact that most people chose to wear a sign shirt when getting to know each other.
If you are in the Greek holiday islands, beware!
There's a cyclone coming in - the weather warning shouts red
During the weekend, as much water can rain in southern Greece as in Finland over an average of six months.
The horrid storm Zorbas will strike Greece during the weekend.
Be prepared if you are staying in the Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Kyklaads or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens announces it on its Facebook page.
According to the broadcast, the Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red weather warning to the areas.
The approaching storm is also reported in the weather service foreca's blog.
According to it, the storm's strongest bursts are up to 45 metres per second.
For comparison, the Kuisma storm, which beat Finland early in the week, blew at its worst at about 31 metres per second.
According to the blog, the main concern of the storm Zorbas, however, is not the wind, but the heavy rains.
During the weekend, more than 300 mm of water can be delivered in southern Greece.
It accounts for about half of Finland's annual rainfall.
The weather service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video of the storm's development on its Facebook page.
Earlier this week, storm Zorbas has caused flooding in Tunisia and Libya.
Do you recognize Love Island Finland - Anku, who is drooling by men?
Performs in confusing Youtube videos
Few people know that in the Love Island Suomi series, Anku, a beauty drooled by several men, also performs as a craftswoman with strange YouTube videos released in 2010.
In the videos, Anku advises craftsmen, among other things, to make an squid from an old roll of paper.
Anku also shows in his sympathetic style how tights can be spent on a hedgehog with real spikes.
Now let's make the Easter grass grow, but let's do it in a slightly surprising way, Anku insinuates and displays sawdust, tights and grass seeds from which he makes the hedgehog.
You can watch videos from below or from Ankun Youtube here.
Valtteri Bottas shook and bursted with adrenaline in Sochi - will he be Hamilton's helper on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas shook for a little more than dozens of minutes after his Russian GP pole drive while he was in front of the media.
The great tour left behind Mercedes' number one star, Lewis Hamilton, and was certainly an important psychological criticism even for the Finnish driver who collected this season.
Nice round.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he dropped out of the round.
Feels good, I'm still shaking a bit, Bottas explained.
I've only been on the stake once this year, in Austria (midsummer), so time has passed quite a bit.
This track has been good for me in the past, and I got good rounds again.
Sochi's track is not easy to bypass, so the departure is especially big.
And, of course, Bottas had to answer the question about whether he's going to win tomorrow or whether he's going to win the World Championship in front of him.
My starting point for the race is definitely trying to win.
There can be no other goal when leaving the stake, Bottas impaled.
But as a stable, we fight for both championships.
Lewis' lead to Sebastian Vettel is pretty big and the difference between me and me is very big, so it should be kept in mind.
Let's see what happens, but Bottas did.
Hamilton was genuinely happy that Bottas had succeeded after the race, and the Mercedes stable boss Toto Wolff had a taste too.
Lewis had a plan to win Valtteri, but he did not succeed in a seven-strike.
Valtteri knows he has to tear everything out of himself to win over Lewis.
And he was so charged that the adrenaline burst out of his ears, Wolff shone.
The question was whether the stable would allow Bottas and Hamilton to drive uprightly, Wolff answered with evasiveness.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
Kiteelainen Erno Kinnunen won the Finnish Rally Championship
The Finnish Championship series for racing ended rarely.
Hardly ever before have the brothers ended up as Finland's champions at the same time.
Now it was Eerik and Henrik St. Petersburg from Tusula, who were driven around Turku and Salo, because Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 classes.
The Kitee-based Erno Kinnunen secured the best achievement of his career, as the third place in the finals sealed him with the Finnish Championship of two-wheeled cars from the SM4 class.
Honda Civic rival Kinnunen and co-driver Ville Mäkelä started the Turku competition with a calm start, because the starting points were clear: the investment in the top group would guarantee the Finnish Championship title.
In Friday night's darkness, the duo had to give evening as some of the extra lights failed with another special test.
It allowed me to put a third spot in a pretty blind spot.
In a situation like that, it's not a good idea.
On Saturday, the speed of Jussi Tepo, who was the second in the series, was followed, Kinnunen said.
Syria demands the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops
Syrian Foreign Minister calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Secretary of State Walid Muallem, who spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, said foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and unconditionally.
Muallem said foreign troops are in Syria fighting terrorism, and the war against terrorists, he said, is "almost over."
In his UN speech, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
But there is no end to seven years of war.
Over 360,000 people have died in the war.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday in Germany that a meeting is planned for October in Syria, which would include the presidents of France, Russia and Turkey.
Not quite Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched Supreme Court judge drama on TV
The Supreme Court candidate, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, got exceptionally many people in front of the screens.
In the United States, the full - power Supreme Court judge's appointment drama got at least 20 million people to watch their televisions on Thursday.
At the time, Donald Trump's appointed Kavanaugh and his California professor Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, were in front of the Senate Legal Committee to tell their story.
According to preliminary results, the hearings were followed by a total of 20,4 million viewers on six main channels: ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
In addition to them, online consultation was followed by several million more.
NBC reported that 6.8 million people followed live streaming, and CNN reported a record of 8.2 million live broadcasts in the year.
CNN will increase by more than 10 million, including those following the broadcast via Youtube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also made 8.0 million start-ups.
The digital start-ups are channels' own, the TV viewers are from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen will publish the final readings on Monday, but they will be huge anyway.
Few reach 20 million
In the United States, more than 20 million viewers are usually only allowed to play sports games, as well as the big Oscar and Grammy gala in the entertainment world, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches and presidential debates in 2016.
Of course, it's a long way to go to the US's most watched annual show, the American Football League's NFL final match at the Super Bowl.
This year Super Bowl gathered about 103 million people on NBC.
Last year, Mr. Trump's first speech to Congress was attended by nearly 48 million people and more than 30 million inaugural people, according to Nielsen.
Top priority
The Supreme Court's appointment is an extremely important case in the USA, since the posts are for life.
Trump was already able to appoint one new judge when Antonin Scalia died in early 2016 and Republicans managed to stop the president Barack Obama from appointing a successor to him.
Another place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced that he would retire this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but on a number of questions he was a so-called scales language whose voice could determine the position of a court of nine.
He was a supporter of the right to abortion and the rights of sexual minorities, and in 2015, for example, he decided in his vote that same-sex people were entitled to marriage rights throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative in his heels.
His choice to the Supreme Court may lock the court's conservative superiority for decades.
Children have the right to have their information to parents
Only parents of children under the age of 10 can see their children's health records from the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong and it's weird.
The situation of the Kanta service was, of course, even more worrying: the parents did not even get to see the health records or recipes of the infants.
A temporary correction was made in autumn 2016 for those under the age of 10.
Since then, practices have been promised to be corrected, but it has taken an amazing long time to repair.
Now the repair is coming - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, changing the legal basis should not have been more than a call-through.
After that, with the layman's understanding, it's a push of a button: now that the wire is closed, it's opened.
Of course, a child can show his or her parents - if he or she has bank codes or an official ID card.
But how many 10-year-olds do?
The ID card is subject to a fee, and the 10-year-old does not even get bank IDs.
So, in practice, you can't see a elementary school fourth grader's data unless you ask for it printed out.
It is not so much about parental rights as about children's rights.
It is extremely important that parents can be involved in the child's care.
Of course, the right of teenagers to privacy must be taken care of.
Minors can also have family situations in which you cannot talk about all things freely.
Often they are related to sexual health, for which free care is a deeply significant human right.
In the United States, the Feds started to clean up harassment charges against Kavanaugh.
According to U.S. media, the FBI investigates harassment allegations from at least two women.
One of the women was heard earlier this week by the Senate Justice Committee.
Kavanaugh has denied the allegations of alleged sexual harassment during his studies.
U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate allegations at the request of the Senate Justice Committee.
The investigation must not take longer than a week.
According to Washington Post, it is a more limited investigation than a criminal investigation, and it does not necessarily become public.
He threatened to kill police officers at a police station in Kajaani
The caught brawler continued to pulkating even in the station.
Police say they put a man in a police prison to "soot off."
The police were threatened by a suspected abuser on the night against Saturday in Kajaani.
Officials report an incident that began when a man of 30 and over filed a violent dispute at a downtown restaurant.
The man first assaulted another customer inside the nutrition store.
This resulted in the removal from the restaurant.
Outside, the fighter attacked another man by pouring him down.
When the third party tried to intervene, the man still hit him.
The triple assault led to the police being called.
The patrol caught the man and took Kajaani to the police station, the police said.
The suspect was still aggressive at the police station.
He kicked another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill and abuse the police.
Police say they put a man in a police prison to "soot off."
The man is suspected of three assaults and violent protests against an official.
Aid organisations are preparing to start work at the Indonesian Sulawes - "Pure water is the most urgent"
UNICEF and other international aid organisations are ready to help on the Indonesian island of Sulawes, says Finnish UNICEF information manager Kirsi Haru.
Local authorities are in charge of rescue work, but the need for additional assistance is already evident at this stage.
Unicef operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, Unicef always has a full emergency response capability, says Haru.
The first task now is to find people in the ruins, both survivors and dead.
In the city of Palu, Sulawes, rescue operations are underway, but in the Donggala region, the situation is a bit more unclear in the north.
There are still places where the connections don't work.
The aid measures are difficult, because the roads are also broken, says Haru.
The buildings are often light-structured at Sulawes, so the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami is huge.
When the survivors are found, they need shelter - for example, tents at first - and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
The first thing most people can do is offer water cleaning tablets, which UNICEF also has in storage.
Efforts will be made to repair water systems as soon as possible, but in an emergency, water will be transported first by trucks, for example.
In times of crisis, many children are separated from their parents.
The search for family members and the reunification of families is one part of Unicef's mission field.
Food aid is organised by the World Food Programme, the World Food Programme (WFP), which is part of the UN, among others.
In the initial phase, the funds previously raised will be used for emergency aid.
However, UNICEF, among others, has already started a fundraising to help the victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami.
Billionaire Elon Musk, chairman of Tesla's board, will end the $20 million fine for tweets.
The founder of space rockets and electric cars, Elon Musk, avoids fraud charges in an agreement with the US Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk will end his role as chairman of the board of the electric car company Tesla and agree to a $20 million fine.
Musk resigns as part of the contract he entered into with the U.S. Securities Market Supervisory Authority.
By agreeing, Musk avoids fraud charges.
US Securities Commission SEC threatened Muski for securities fraud because of tweets he sent in August.
There Musk wrote that he is preparing to withdraw Tesla from the stock market, which led to a rapid increase in the company's share price.
According to the agreement, Musk is not allowed to chair Tesla's board for three years.
In addition, Teslan must appoint a new "independent member" to its board of directors and include two "independent leaders".
Tesla must also set up a committee to monitor Muski's communications.
Musk still gets to be the CEO of Tesla.
In addition to Muski's personal $20 million fines, Tesla also has to pay a similar $20 million fine to the financial supervisor.
Tweets misdirected investors
According to the SEC, Musk's tweets led investors and Tesla's shareholders astray.
Musk claimed he would have secured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock market as a private limited company.
According to billionaire tweets, the company would have been bought out of the stock market at a price of $420.
After tweets, Tesla's share price rose by more than 10 per cent in 24 hours, but fell later.
According to the SEC, Muski's claims had no basis whatsoever.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated the funding he claimed.
He had also not discussed the withdrawal from the stock exchange with the other board of directors or the board of directors of the company.
On Friday this week, the rate dropped 14 per cent when the SEC announced a fraud charge.
It is expected that the company's course will be renewed in order to agree on the news.
The last sentence is not a reason
Of course, the bells of the cathedral don't ring when the hands don't move.
It's a technical flaw.
The clock at the Helsinki Cathedral Tower has stopped.
The wise men point to 12 o'clock.
The situation is like a mediocre horror film: even when the church crypt would hear an exorcism and the organ would sing to itself.
Of course, this is not the case, but the clock has stopped for a technical reason: it has broken.
It has been visited by a repairman, but some parts have broken and a new part is expected, says Suntio Evelina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the fact already mentioned by the Church in Helsinki Twitter account.
The account states that the final sentence is not a reason for the clock to stop.
Jamsen says church bells don't ring because of a fault.
