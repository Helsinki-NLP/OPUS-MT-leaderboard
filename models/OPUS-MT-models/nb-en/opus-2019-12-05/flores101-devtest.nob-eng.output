Everyone is in society and use of transport systems.
In developed countries, you may be tempted to hear complaints on the quality of water or about bridges that fall down.
Why do they bring systems to transport so carefully, why do they fail on a daily basis? Is the transport capacity that is something more fundamentally going on?
Traffic float is the study of individual drivers and vehicle movements between two points and their interactions.
Unfortunately, there is complicated to study traffic flow, as it is impossible to predict the behaviour of drivers with a hundred percent security.
Now, guys tend to behave with a somewhat consistent case so that the road flight is quite consistent and with possibility to compute mathematically with a reasonable degree of security.
To show the flight in traffic better, connection has been established between three important features: (1) float, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, design and operation of modes.
Insecter was the first animals that could fly. Their opportunity to fly did it easier and more efficient for them to drop away from enemies, find food and comuses.
