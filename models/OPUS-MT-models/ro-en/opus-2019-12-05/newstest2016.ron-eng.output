UN chief says no military solutions in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict that has been going on for almost five years and more weapons would only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief has once again called on all parties, including the UN divided Security Council to unite and support negotiations in order to find a political solution.
Ban said on Wednesday at a conference that he plans to meet with foreign ministers from five countries permanently present on the council - the US, Russia, China, England and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial session to discuss Syria.
Ban regretted that divisions in the council and between the Syrian people and regional powers "made this situation unsolvable."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity when they were able to conclude an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 figures from polls showing Donald Trump has real chances
Some tried to label him as a flip-flop politician.
Others called it a joke.
And others await the implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to knock Donald Trump down from the top of the polls, it hasn't worked (yet).
Ten out of the last 11 national surveys have shown that Donald Trump leads by a percentage of two figures and some voices are seriously beginning to wonder what this means for the chances of naming the real estate mogul.
Of course, it's still premature.
None of this says that Trump will win the race for the Republican nomination.
Pundits shows that, at the same time in 2011, Rick Perry's advance made way for Herman Cain in the polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
And the reasons why they would fight so hard in the general election are numerous.
But groups on the outside such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Club for Growth recognise Trump's power and start supporting him with money.
Next we present a few figures from recent polls that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a passing thing:
The figures indicating support for Trump have returned to 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy, in mid-June, a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive opinion of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage went up to 40%.
In early August, it was 52%.
At present, six out of 10 Republicans have a favourable opinion about Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
These figures shall be maintained.
A survey conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60% of Republicans in the region have a favourable opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the nomination race.
In a poll conducted last week by CNN / ORC, 67% of Republicans said they would be "excited" or "satisfied" if Trump won the nomination race.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be "upset" if Trump won the nomination race.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they would be "excited" compared to 40% saying the same thing about Trump).
Closest in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say they would be "unhappy" or "angry" if favorite Jeb Bush wins the nomination race.
Most Republicans don't consider Trump's temper a problem.
Although Donald Trump has been strongly criticised for his insults and bombastic style, 52% of Republican voters at national level believe that the housing mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to ABC News / Washington Post's poll Monday.
We find the same figures in Iowa, where all 52% of Republicans believe that Trump has the right personality to be a leader, according to Quinnipiac's poll last week.
However, 44% believe that he does not have the personality to act effectively and almost six out of 10 independent say that his temper does not belong in the White House, according to ABC / Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When I take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters consider Trump authentic.
According to a poll conducted last week by CNN / ORC, to the question of who has the best chance of winning the GOP nomination race, four out of 10 said Trump.
The situation changed from the end of July, when four out of 10 would have bet on Jeb Bush.
Full information: in the past, GOP voters have not read the future very well.
During the same period of the last election, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry in the nomination race, compared to only 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that the majority of GOP voters find Trump's campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans replete to another candidate, Trump is still at the top of the board.
Some say that the divided situation will probably contribute to Trump's victory, while the support against Trump will be divided into more than twelve candidates.
However, a survey conducted at the beginning of September by the University of Monmouth shows that, in the hypothetical situation of collaboration between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from majority support.
Trump is 13 points from Carly Fiorina, 14 points from Marco Rubio, 15 points from Walker, 19 points from Jeb Bush, and finally 33 points from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's almost even with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to defeat him?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman by 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one confrontation.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they've decided.
A new poll conducted by CBS / NYT on Tuesday shows that more than half of the voters who support Trump say they are not changing their voting option.
Obviously, much can happen in this respect and no one can say that they will never change their mind.
46% say they leave the door open to change their option.
However, Trump's most important opponent is currently neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but it is twice as likely that voters who say they have decided to vote with Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on the immigration issue.
Since Donald Trump named Mexico's immigrants "rapists" in his campaign opening speech two months ago, immigration has been the focus of the 2016 campaign.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic style will lead to a split between the major Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and harm rebranding efforts.
However, according to the ABC / Post survey Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on the immigration issue.
So, it seems that as long as the immigration issue remains in the spotlight, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration towards authorities reaches new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by almost half of Republican voters, largely due to their status as outsiders.
According to the ABC / Post survey Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to the detriment of someone with experience in government.
People are also angry at the authorities in Washington.
A survey conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by Des Moines Register / Bloomberg shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the performance of the Republicans in CÃ¸ngres, with 54% declaring themselves "dissatisfied" and 21% "nervous at the top."
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been long awaited
The new Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn will later make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions, facing David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn would ask the first of the six questions to which he was entitled shortly after lunch; his performance would probably be examined closely by the media and Labour lawmakers.
In weekly appearances, he called for "less theatre and more facts."
He also said that he could give up several participations and give them to his colleagues.
The confrontation will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test in a leading position, coming after naming a "phantom cabinet" and the speech he gave Tuesday at the annual TUC congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader's decision to keep quiet at the national anthem during a mass held on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75-year anniversary of the Battle of England drew criticism from conservative lawmakers and held the headlines.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he "kept quiet respectfully" and acknowledged "the heroism of the British Air Force at the Battle of England."
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's phantom cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC's Two's Newssight that he would have recommended the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
About twelve ministers in the phantom cabinet refused to be part of Mr Corbyn's leading team, arguing with differences of opinion related to economics, defence and foreign, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says the political differences "cumulate" in the Labour Party after the appointment of Mr Corbyn regarding his position with the European Union and the limit of benefits.
Mr Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party will bring about changes that will eliminate the whole idea of limitation.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, Minister of Labour and Pensions, said the party "is very clear" in its exclusive opposition to the government's plans to reduce the "head" level from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has faced at the stands in the last decade, since he took over the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas "from external sources" for questions to be addressed to Mr. Cameron and has received over 30,000 suggestions.
Congressman Islington North said that PMQs involve too high a level of confrontation and will refrain from replicas and attacks, committing to instead focusing on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the Minister of Finance, will take her place at the PMQs when he cannot participate - for example when Mr Cameron moves abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to speak occasionally, saying that he approached the President of the Chamber of Deputies, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he took the lead, Mr Cameron said he wished to give up the political style "Punch and Judy" often associated with PMQs but admitted a few years later that he had failed in his approach.
Since the first transmission, in 1990, PMQs has been considered a key barometer of a leader's reasoning, of how he leads the Chamber of Deputies and of his position among parliamentary colleagues, although critics say he has become a caricature and that he needs a profound reform.
"Frame in Joburg": Young homeless people receive photography courses
It's difficult to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets as a child found a way to learn a trade and earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people to take pictures of the areas they live in and earn money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
JD Sports Chief says higher wages could damage enlargement
JD Sports President Peter Cowgill says an increase in minimum wage in Britain could mean "greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
However, that purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher costs for the company's workforce, he says.
Costs could impact on JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was collateral damage in the "storm" created around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior rather deserves praise and not criticism, according to President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often called "Special KS," was unpleasantly dragged into the spotlight by the scandalous skid that Kyrgios had over Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
In a fierce qualifying match played shortly after, in Cincinnati, the seat referee had to intervene twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison said: "Wawrinka should have knocked Kyrgios down, and I should have put this kid down."
Although he was last seen making a dust missile after having had muscle cramps and missed a possible US Open tournament, angry at Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was strongly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth for second place in individual, after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup against England semifinals.
"One thing I feel strong about is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was drawn a little into conflict," Healy said.
The truth is that he broke a missile when he lost because he accused cramps in the US, but he's not the first player to break a rocket out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he wouldn't be proud of it.
But let's face it, he's got a lot of control in pretty challenging situations in the US with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of confidence.
He's got a great team, he's got a great family next door, and I think he's been treated unfairly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, works hard and has integrated into the team, has had no conflict with other players, is highly respected in lockers, trains hard, is in excellent shape, is a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged solely on the basis of his qualities and defects.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account for the important draw match, which starts on Friday, and described the "joint decision" as the most appropriate for all, but supported the return of the long-term player from Canberra to the team.
"First, we want the team to fully focus on the draw match and not think at all about the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick went up very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have said, he matures under the eyes of the public and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves to be criticised, but we are trying to support him, we are trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think he needs a time when he is not in the spotlight to be able to reflect, which is good for both the team and him.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage to Bernie Sanders halved in national polls
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still has a two-digit advantage in the democratic race for national candidacy, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of democratic voters (down from 58%), while Sanders is second by 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is supported by 15% of democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of the primary elections, the majority of democratic voters say it is too early to say that they have decided on the candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are stronger in their choice than other candidates' supporters.
Compared to the CBS survey last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won several percent.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has been reduced.
Men's support has been considerably reduced and Sanders is only 5 points away.
Clinton's advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated and is now on par with Sanders.
However, Clinton is still ahead of the senior voters.
Last month, Clinton stood before Sanders, with a percentage of two figures among liberals, but Sanders now has a slight 5-point lead in this group.
About half of national democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were elected to run on behalf of the party.
A quarter would support it somewhat and another 15% would only support it because it represents the party.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are likely to be excited by his choice.
Opinions are more mixed up among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support her with enthusiasm.
While 48% of democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican voters who say the same about the first ranking, Donald Trump (35%) is lower.
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question about why they would want her to win the race, the majority response is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this function (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these issues and eligibility shall also be mentioned.
Given that the Vice-President is considering a possible presidential candidacy, 57% of democratic voters would like to see him race - although one third think they should not run.
On the question of the second option for the party representative, democratic voters make Biden a majority.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half say that Biden would be the second option, well ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic race, Hillary Clinton's advantage to Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points if he does not run.
55% of democratic voters consider Clinton the most likely candidate to win the general election; but the figures fell from 78% last month.
Biden is in second place, but the percentage according to which he is the most eligible has increased.
However, when asked what is most important about an elected candidate, democratic voters prefer problems to eligibility.
As last month, no Democratic candidate or possible candidate is considered by these voters to be unacceptable as a representative of the party in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or possible candidates are doing well in terms of some key features towards the primary voters of their party.
Most voters consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be integral and reliable and have strong leadership qualities.
Biden is best seen of all three in terms of integrity, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of democratic voters do not believe that H. Clinton is honest and reliable, twice as many as those who say this about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not have an opinion of him in this regard.
Democratic voters also generally consider that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideologies as they do.
On all these issues, about a quarter of democratic voters do not have an opinion about Sanders.
As questions persist regarding the use of a personal email address and server by Hillary Clinton when she was Secretary of State, the majority of democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the subject and say that it did not affect their overall view of the candidate.
But things are different among the American public.
Half of Americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public opinion was split on this issue in March shortly after the issue came to light.
Most Americans say that the controversy over email has not affected their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36% say they have changed their opinion in a negative way.
Mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, say they have changed their opinion about Clinton in a negative way.
Although the Democratic voters consider Clinton to be honest and reliable, this issue continues to raise problems among voters at a general level: only 32% consider her to be sound and reliable, 8% less than last month and 15% less than in May.
62% of voters do not consider it sound and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of voters at national level do not consider Trump sound and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Of the six evaluated candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush are ranked first in terms of integrity.
The number of people who regard Sanders as upright is higher than those who do not agree, but, as with Carson, many do not think of him.
The error margin for the 351 sample of primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the fraternity indicted for the murder of the first-year student at Baruch College
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the Pennsylvania Pocono Mountains, five people were charged with murder.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at the Baruch Faculty in New York brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
Official sources say the victim was blindfolded, placed in the back of a 14 kg backpack full of sand, and was repeatedly bullied while attempting to move towards a target on a frozen terrain.
Mr. Deng accused of headaches and then lost consciousness.
The Pi Delta Psi brothers did not call the emergency number after he passed out and claim they would have waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, the police say.
However, they found the time it took to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact National Fraternity President Andy Meng to ask for his advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide their personal belongings and basically put the good of the brotherhood before Michael Deng's good," Wagner said.
He couldn't be resuscitated and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated trauma to the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been devastated by the sorority rituals since 1970, at least one student lost his life every year because of the rituals," said Douglas Fierberg, Deng's family lawyer, in a statement.
Brotherhood and their members must be held accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The Monroe District Grand Jury recommended that the top five members be charged with murder in the third degree.
Another thirty-two fraternity members, including Mr. Meng, will also be indicted for assault and conspiracy to commit murder.
"We want to hold it accountable not only to the persons involved but, if there is an organisation that has authorized the brotherhood, officially or unofficially, we will also hold it accountable," Wagner said Tuesday at a press conference.
Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national brotherhood withdrew its affiliation with the local representation.
Here's what will happen when the Federal Reserve increases the interest rate
The interest rate will increase and the bull market (rising market) will stumble, bond profitability will increase and the economy will go into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it's gonna happen and how long it's gonna take.
In the economy, history provides little indication of time frame..
After the first increase in the interest rate, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates is often, although not always a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
That is why US central bank officials have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on when the interest rate begins to increase but on the path of time needed for normalisation.
Indeed, there are multiple variables in the game.
However, in the end, market players might find that all the commotion about the increase in interest rates has been exaggerated.
"The first interest rate increase decided by the Fed after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some voices as a sign of the era of" cheap money, "said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, on a note addressed to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal but still low levels to constitute the seismic shock that everyone seems to be afraid of.
But it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
Next, we present how some sectors of the economy could react, building on historical trends:
Given the situation the market has experienced in recent months, anticipating an increase in the interest rate may make things more volatile for a while.
But at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for capital profitability to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect the phase of monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what will happen after the Fed's increases.
More specifically, over the last 35 years, the market has increased sharply - by about 14 percent - moving towards an increase in the interest rate, which is quite invariable in the 250 days after (average climb of 2.6%) and then returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by the chief strategist of Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche stated that the impact on the shares tends to become more pronounced later in the interest rate growth cycle and the benefits are beginning to fall.
The recession is a reality of economic life but the increase in interest rates often contributes to it.
In this situation, the Fed is facing conditions that have not existed before and could accelerate a recession.
In particular, the gross domestic product will approach its historical minimum point for an increase in the Fed interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, out of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was less than 4,5%.
Although in the second quarter of 2015 the value was 3,6%, few expect the situation to persist, with the third quarter reaching only 1,5%, according to Atlanta Fed.
The increase in the interest rate in such a fragile economy could be risky and raise the question "whether this time is different," Deutsche said.
Players on the market have been preparing for a growth decision from the Fed all year round, with all eyes aimed at this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Commission, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategists and economists believe that the FWTO could approve an increase in the interest rate at this meeting, forward transactions indicate a probability of only 25%.
"In our study after 1950, all interest rate growth cycles so far have been in a super profit growth cycle, with GDP eclipsing the peaks before the recession very quickly after the start of recovery," the report said.
On the contrary, this was an oddly slow recovery after the worst recession in the period analysed.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected by the Fed at the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months, and it reached 74 months and continues.
The fixed income was also volatile given that the market expects an increase in the interest rate and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster in the case of bonds than in the case of shares when the Fed changes policy.
In the case of bonds, it appears that the benefits change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the interest rate growth cycle, the return on the bonds immediately decreases, "Deutsche said.
The Charles Schwab strategies believe that these interest rate increases will bring profitability closer to short-term and long-term bonds, flattening the curve.
High-return bonds are better at this kind of environment, although "we are still cautious about forcing profitability," a Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst in Schwab, said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expectations of Fed policy.
"In addition to the power of the dollar and the decrease in estimated inflation, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of a more rigorous monetary policy," Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the profitability curve is fairer, the spread of the average credit interest rate has increased and volatility has increased - all market characteristics when Fed strengthens policy.
Overall, companies that operate mostly in the US will benefit from the increase in interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with high debts will suffer as the increase in the dollar will increase their products in the global market and their debt will be more expensive.
"History shows that" quality "stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial interest rate increase," analyst Goldman Sachs said in a report to customers.
Firms with strong balance sheets exceeded those with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital receipts as well as low volatility stocks also exceeded similar companies with low quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Duty will become an important issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also benefit from the increase in the dollar.
Those who save could also benefit, although experts do not agree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the radio station because he "foolishly"
He says it is increasingly similar to the commercial opponent
He also caught a glimpse of the BBC Music Awards, claiming they had plagiarized the Brits.
Colleagues Damien Collins attacked The Voice, claiming that this show is not original either.
BBC Radio 3 "turns into" Classic FM, "said an important MP, putting pressure on the post to prove that he is doing something that commercial posts are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC heads that the public radio station "foolishly" and increasingly resembles the commercial opponent.
"I have the impression that Radio 3" foolishly "- although I do not like to use the word - but I have the impression that it is turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also caught eye contact with the BBC Music Awards, released last December.
BBC Music Awards, released last year, appear to be Brits under a different name.
So if you try to do something different - these are the two examples that come to mind that only copy what already exists on the market, "Mr Bingham said.
The BBC Director General denied the allegations, saying BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of his commercial opponent on live music and public education.
I'm not gonna find out anywhere about the classical music I hear from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
"In addition, I think it is also important to commit Radio 3 to discovering new music and allocating new parts," he said.
In the first part of this year, BBC Radio 3 editor Alan Davey said he had to make more efforts to attract the audience to the previous period because the British had less knowledge of classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only element under the BBC logo criticised at the meeting of the Culture, Media and Sports Committee because it would follow in the footsteps of its commercial rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the talent show the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media for approximately Â£22 million.
Do you understand why there are often discussions about this show because it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the show by BBC1 - having Paloma Faith and Boy George on the jury - be performed "in a BBC manner."
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "find the chicken with golden eggs in its own backyard" next time it launches an entertainment show.
However, he refused to ban taking over new seasons from The Voice in the future or to spend money on licences on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales saw the smallest increase in August, and the culprit could be Black Friday.
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
In the last month there has been the slowest increase since 2000.
Online sales took off three years ago, thanks to the use of your mobile phone to shop.
Specialists are of the opinion that the Black Friday in November could lead to a reluctance to spend.
For over a decade, online shopping has exploded and transformed the commercial streets of Britain into ghost cities.
However, specialists say there are signs that online sales are being reduced, with the latest figures showing an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
The total money spent in August showed the smallest increase since 2000, with an increase of only 5% in the last year.
Specialists say there are signs that online sales are shrinking, with the latest figures showing an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
"If we look at the level of growth in previous years and go back to 2000, there has always been a tendency to rationalise over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor at the IMRG sales index, for Guardian.
He explained that online sales took off three years ago, when buyers started using their mobile phone to shop.
This increased the number of people who could shop online and could do so under different circumstances, such as on the couch.
But now that it's stagnating a little, you might notice a decrease (in growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is referred to as one of the reasons for the drop in sales.
According to specialists, buyers would refrain from making purchases prior to the event that took place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers crammed in front of computers to get their hands on offers, leading to the collapse of the websites of several retailers.
Specialists believe that Black Friday, when buyers got into a bargain fight, could lead to the reluctance of buyers.
A study published by British Retail Consortium determined that at least 1 Â£1 of each Â£5 is spent online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of purchases are currently made via online shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to turn to fashion shops in commercial areas.
After sanctioning the Bin Laden family, Muslims bury the victims killed following the collapse of the Mecca crane
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were walked on the streets by Muslims, with the first funerals held in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia partially blamed the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the collapse.
Health Minister said a total of 394 people were injured following crane collapse
In the street walk ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a collapsed crane at the great mosque in Mecca.
Dressed in white, those who complained of their deaths joined on the road to express their condolences until the first dead reached the end of the final journey at the cemetery of Al-Moaisem.
The sad memory of the holy place, where just a few days ago a construction crane collapsed through the ceiling of the mosque, falling on the faithful.
The bodies were released for funerals after the King of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the Bin Laden family construction group for disaster, which also resulted in 394 casualties.
In the ceremony on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a collapsed crane at the great mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Great Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr Akram was in the Great Mosque with his parents before the annual Hajj pilgrimage began.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims still reaching the city.
Today, King Salman stated that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane arm raised when the crane was not in operation.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, stated that the Binladin Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The news agency's English service did not present that detail, but stated that the company leaders had been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to collapse in the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made statements about the crane collapse and the Group's representatives could not be contacted for statements.
The Royal Decree blamed the group for not using up-to-date safety measures and for not coordinating its work with the meteorological authorities.
Dozens of cranes surround the Great Mosque in Mecca, as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For decades, the Binladin family has had a close relationship with the royal family of Saudi Arabia and is conducting major construction projects.
Al Qaida's last leader, Osama bin Laden, was a "renegade" son, disinherited by the family in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in conditions of strong wind and rain, just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, essential journey at least once in the life of each physically fit Muslim.
The authorities say 158 people remain in the hospital.
The authorities decided that the relatives of the deceased victims would receive one million Saudi Rials (174,000 pounds) and the same amount would be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other wounded will receive half of this amount.
Advantages and disadvantages of the conversion of credits to Swiss francs
Two offers have already appeared on the banking market to convert the credits into Swiss francs, the main advantages being the exclusion of foreign exchange risk and the reduction of rates.
The disadvantages can come in a few years, when variable interest can lead to higher rates.
Banca Transilvania has just completed the process of converting the loans into francs granted by Volksbank, and Bancpost announced the conversion offer for its own clients.
According to the pooled data of FinZoom financial portal analysts, Bancpost offers three years of fixed interest on lei, 1.5%, the lowest on the market.
On the other hand, the offer to convert Banca Transilvania was accepted by 83% of clients with franc credits due to the second successive cuts: the balance was reduced with the value of the risk and administration fees paid by the client, then an additional reduction of 22.5% was applied to the balance in lei.
Both offers reduce the rates of their customers, compared to what they paid monthly equivalent in lei before conversion.
Thus, Banca Transilvania reduces the rate by 42.5% and Bancpost by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the coming years.
Benefits
The main advantage of the loan in MDL in CHF is that the foreign exchange risk is eliminated, the consumer being protected from future increases in the franc, and the credit will be repaid in the currency in which he earns his salary.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that no revaluation of the property is made, no further guarantees are required and no further proof of income is required.
In practice, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of credit, nor will there be any additional costs as in case of refinancing.
Both banks also offer a discount at the monthly rate, compared to what customers paid before conversion, equivalent in lei.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first years is more of interest, and the client reimburses very little of the principal.
The Bancpost offer with very low interest rates in the first three years seems advantageous to customers.
However, it is not known how this interest will evolve after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be higher than 3.25%, so overall, and the cost reduction is lower.
A possible risk for all credits in MDL with variable interest rate is that the ROBOR index will increase significantly in the coming years (more than the Libor-CHF index).
For example, ROBOR at three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it reached 6%, in 2009, at more than 15%, and in a few days in 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, other costs may occur, not mentioned in the original offer.
The time has come for decisions on the interest rate for the US Federal Reserve
The world is staring at the scheduled meeting in two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve will make the crucial decision whether or not to increase the interest rate for the first time after about a decade.
In a survey conducted by Reuters involving 80 economists, just over half of whom last week believed the decision would be made, I now believe that the situation will continue for a while and that interest rates will be maintained within the current 0-0.25% range.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought the rates to zero.
For the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could drop the zero rate and initiate a process of normalising interest rates, "said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has evolved relatively well, with the recovery bringing trillion dollars into the balance sheet and generating low inflation.
But the Federal Reserve must not ignore the less pink global situation.
He warned markets to prepare for growth, but there are signs that even they think such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20: 00 CET.
Stars who have lost their charm
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has experienced stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia and in 2009 he lost his lifelong partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
It is also rumored that the actor faced the problem of drug use and in 2008 was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this definitely has a cost.
The player Luke Shaw of Manchester United is sitting on the stand for a few months because of double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture on his right leg in the Manchester United Champions League match, ended with a defeat in front of PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the player's eye and that will keep him on the stand for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The accident occurred following a reckless intervention by HÃ©ctor Moreno in the 15th minute after Shaw, 20, broke the PSV defense.
He received medical attention for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after then he'll be operated on in Manchester.
It's awful -- a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, has difficulties, then plays fantastic, and now this happens.
His locker room had his oxygen mask on.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but the double fracture is six months and I won't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Turns out Moreno got lucky and got rid of the red card and the concession of a penalty kick.
The referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say it's foul and red card.
It was a very nasty, two-legged intervention.
A message on Shaw's Twitter account: "Thank you all for your messages, I have no words to express how weak I feel, I start my way to recovery, I'll come back stronger."
Similar news: Manchester United hit by Luke Shaw's injury in PSV defeat
The quarterback of the England team has an additional reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, "This is a very nasty injury."
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an injury.
Our players never aim to hurt an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for the Mexican national against the Dutch national led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Championship.
"It is very difficult for him because he did not intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear that it is a very serious injury, it is not good," Cocu said.
I didn't see it.
All I could see was the ball, which was heading in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] had touched it, but I couldn't see the intervention on Luke.
In his statement for SBS6, Moreno said, "I know what it's like, I know how difficult it is to go through something like this.
I feel really bad, I'm so sorry.
PSV player AndrÃ©s Guardado also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth has clearly risked England's omission, but he's still holding on.
Victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the team selected by England for the tournament, I do not consider a repeat of the 3-0 defeat in the test matches.
I wouldn't eliminate any version of a moving victory.
Alastair Cook's team may have less experience than three years ago but it has good players on the spin in the batting line and collective morale is strong; they will not be marked by the events of 2012 but will have a youthful positive attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the test level, is an option for attack.
Similar topics: Adam Lyth left England for the test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his head coach in Yorkshire, I find it difficult to examine the decision not to select Adam Lyth as a team.
He played the seven test matches against two good attackers, under difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are judged by results.
There were no question marks about Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and I said that before - the players are their own selectors.
About fifty years, and maybe Lyth would have extended his run, but his destiny lies in his hands.
I hope that if you make more runs for Yorkshire you will get other opportunities.
England's leading coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when performance wasn't up to his ability and I'm not surprised at that; first of all, he's a team man.
It's hard to answer the question as long as a batsman is noticed in the test matches.
Lyth had seven runs-- like Sam Robson before him-- while Nick Compton had nine.
Just Compton got lucky at home and away.
The only dissatisfaction you can have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tournament - when Lyth was in maximum shape - but that missed opportunity is in the past.
Here comes Alex Hales, a batsman I'm very fond of.
He is a cricket player who has "factor X" and who I noticed early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch.
It should be given at least the same opportunity as those before it, but this will, of course, depend on the composition of the UAE team.
The idea of Moeen opening a fight with Cook was launched, which would lead to extra spinner while keeping four quicks, and I'm okay with that.
I don't see why a pitcher couldn't hit there, and this left-handed player has already proven himself to be a piece of shit.
Moeen may not have brought success to his district, Worcestershire, but it was number 3 for them, so the difference is not great.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test 38 games as a first drop before he went open in 2001.
He immediately erased three centuries and never looked back.
Zafar Ansari is coming on the team post back-up spinner and although I had limited contact with him, I was struck by the fact that he is a very impressive young man.
People could judge his early age - with an average of 31 on the beat and 35 on the ball - and he might think he's punt, but there's not a bunch of spinners and the selectors have opted for youth.
He'll learn a lot from this tournament.
England has also made some changes to the coaching team.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman of Sri Lanka, as consultant for the test matches could be a master shot.
He is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that he has played in every situation and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white-ball league of the tournament and will bring both energy and relentless ambition.
I always thought he was born to get involved in international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and just like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they send messages that have been transmitted before, can bring fresh air to the team.
Colly Durham's teammate Ben Stokes is resting for one-day games, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that.
Although not all agree, coaches and selectors do not make the program.
And you have to remember, players' jobs depend on the results they get.
Such decisions are never made easily.
Camp Brexit could win if the economy remains in the water by 2017
Every day, David Cameron's renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting more and more confused, even without the choice of brilliant Jeremy "Yes or no?" Corbyn at the head of the Labour Party or TUC brings serious criticism Tuesday towards Europe.
Foreigners also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained in the past days that - plunged into crises similar to that in the EU - not all of which are domestic - some Member States are fuelled by the UK's agenda of concessions and treaty changes, which most do not want.
In Brighton, at the annual meeting, TUC decided that they did not want this either if it eroded social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's "selfie" agenda.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor attend bilateral summits or sessions in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and say they have won allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants a UK with an outward perspective under the EU roof - "Do not leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that several ministers and officials from certain capitals have reached the point where they do not care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the extremely cautious German Chancellor, is an ally but has been in charge for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation wobbles, as happened to Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who stayed too long.
In 2017, the President of France, FranÃ§ois Hollande, will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing one.
It is hard to believe that they will help the British who pose, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from coming out of Britain - something they do not want because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers may even intentionally plan to make remarks that do not help, in the style of SNP, in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"Renegociation was fixed" and "Great Britain obtained nothing of value from renegotiation."
Europeans know, on their own, how harboring Fleet Street can be and how skeptical the oligarchic media barons who look at the EU with scepticism are because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our entry from 1973 in report 2: 1.
Perhaps they vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the Euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was co-repulsive of Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the blending of tax-free punks, foreigners who defrauded the telephone and pseudo non-domi who hold most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them the same way, but he realized that when you're locked in a cage with a nervous gorilla, you have to give him bananas to distract him from the thought of eating you at lunch and again at tea.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to Cameron's idea of a referendum, given that Blair made a concession on the principle of the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which gave him an exit card.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched me on my back Monday at Westminster -- I told him not to waste time with me -- seems to be in danger of adopting Neil Kinnock's boycott strategy from the 80s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but it must develop a coherent strategy for co-operation with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose position at the BBC left her vacant on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I would call with leniency evolution.
He says he wants us to stay in a reformed EU.
Most of the people who disagree with conservative "anglicism" could agree to that.
That is what Hilary said "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on radio and TV this week, when the scout in him struggled not to admit that the appointment of John McDonnell by Corbyn as shadow minister on financial matters was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his father fought on TV to be disloyal to his Labour colleagues, without going too far and without losing his office.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
However, the struggle to remain "in any situation" - Benn's expression - does not correspond to what McDonnell said or to what JC said to colleagues and MPs during Monday night's private meeting.
Regardless of the image that Corbyn wants to convey - remember, it has also made me aware - the discipline of messages remains important in the era of television and especially in the whirlpool of social networks, an outbreak of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a courtesy ticket to Europe, allowing him to take the support of Labour in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
However, McDonnell and Corbyin's basic fascism over EU membership - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just an esoteric discussion among the left-wing dissidents for which the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As in the case of his NATO discipline - Tom Watson is adamant that JC will not campaign for renunciation - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - and there are suspicious voters - for concessions to Britain when everything could be useless?
The US is already quite disappointed about the British 'poor military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government cutting costs, as I was reminded at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Specialists criticise the decision of the UK Department of Public Health on e-cigarettes
According to researchers, the claims of a government agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of whom have links in the tobacco industry.
Specialists from the editorial team of British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticising the evidence used by the UK Department of Public Health (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "reference" report last month and described it as a "complex analysis of evidence."
However, some researchers questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in Lancet medical magazine attacked the "extraordinarily fragile base" on which PHE founded its main conclusion.
Two other researchers who write in the BMJ questioned their claims and based them "on solid soil or on quicksand."
Martin McKee, a European public health professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on proof of effectiveness."
They said that PHE claims that "current estimates show that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking 'are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
In reality, a single meeting attended by 12 people led to the development of a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) summarising their views on the negative effects associated with various nicotine products; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell claimed that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose executive director was said to have received funding from British American Tobacco in the past for an independent study.
It also validated the accreditation of BAT in public health in a sustainability report, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants in the meeting declared the funding received from an electronic cigarette manufacturer but not the funding reported to have been received from the cigarette and tobacco company, Philip Morris International.
The arguments on the basis of which panel members were selected were not provided, but some known "leaders' in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of them even declare the financing of the industry in the work.
Other participants in the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The head of the tobacco control section of PHE also attended the meeting.
The research work prepared by the group "strongly covers" the lack of "solid evidence of the harmful effect of most products according to most criteria," McKee and Capewell said.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell stated that PHE's claims that "so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking among children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, head of the PHE health department, says that claims in BMJ have been answered in the past.
He said: "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking"
One in two people who have smoked their whole lives lose their lives because of this vice.
All evidence suggests that the risk of electronic cigarettes for health is comparatively minor, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about the information that comes out and that does not come out of evidence, especially given the high degree of public confusion about the dangers relative to tobacco.
Every year, around 80,000 people lose their lives because of a disease associated with smoking and the annual costs of the national health system due to smoking reach Â£2 billion.
By clearly expressing the current evidence - that although the use of e-cigarettes is not risk-free, they present only a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we are fulfilling our national duty.
Illegal torture equipment - delivered to the door!
Commercials that shame Britain's arms trade
Watch Amnesty International's film against the arms fair.
Horrible killer drones!
Balls for crushing ankles!
Dispersion bombs!
And electric sticks that cause creepy pain without leaving traces!
The joyous voice and animated images leave no doubt that this commercial for the largest world arms fair is a fierce charade by Amnesty International to underline the wish of the British authorities to sell arms to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at the ExCEL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign has also shown a large number of posters in bus stations and subways that need a second look.
"Important announcement, travel with DLR between September 15 and 18?" says one of the ads, using the fonts and branding of the London subway, the DLR line turning into a tank image.
In September of this year, a lot of arms dealers will attack the DLR Clients are asked to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are made by artists who exhibited works at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called the Special Patrol Group contributed to the distribution in London using the "Ad Space Hack Packs," a six-pound package of Allen keys that says "facilitate access to about a third of the advertising space in the bus stations on the planet."
The London Transportation Direction is not amused by this "vandalism" in the form of flyers.
One of the parody ads produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are asking more and more questions and seeking to make political work accessible to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists are moving towards collaborating with activists in protest movements, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another poster against the arms trade that greets commuters on the subway.
Amnesty's film had over 100,000 Facebook views in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP advertising agency that worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and the artist who doubled the voice also worked for free.
The VCCP's creative director, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence surrounding the arms fair ad - with an empty space in the Excel calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with a more realistic commercial, but "enriching it with strong animations and colors was more striking."
"They did a great job helping us increase our interest in selling illegal torture equipment at the fair," Tom Davies says on behalf of Amnesty.
Now, it would be necessary for the UK authorities to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally marketed and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative form of art on the theme of the arms fair comes from inside ExCEL, where exhibitors offer fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab released an order from the US military on "AT4CS RS with shoulder support launcher."
This includes "a unique-shaped warhead that provides astounding effects behind the armor, inside the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules to live in the dormitory
It's been 11 years since I moved into the dormitory, when I was a 19-year-old who still believed in berets and moral relativity, but only now do I remember the forced smiles of those I annoy - and the numerous complaints about others.
Most of the things I've learned can be summarised in the form of eight simple rules.
Moving into the dorm can bring states that range from nervous breakdown to horror.
The chatter is tempting: to tell people where you come from, if and where you spent a year off from your studies, how do you feel about Corbyn and why, "frankly, Marmite is indifferent to you because, honestly, it's nothing but yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others breathe -- ask questions and show interest.
They animate the conversation and help you differentiate the people you like from the ones you wouldn't talk to even if the flood came and they'd be the only ones who had boats.
Don't suffocate people.
Bedrooms are often full of parties with drinks, movie nights and social meetings, but they are also the place where people dress up and try on their underwear.

Introverts receive special treatment at the university.
Your bedroom should be a refuge, but in many homes, a culture of isolation is built through bedrooms, based on friendship, socialization and lifelong friends.
All this can be terrible for someone who's trying to charge their batteries.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say, "I like you and I want to stay friends, but I want you to leave to get back the energy I've spent interacting with you."
Try to notice when a colleague is exhausted by socialization - and try to send a SMS instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking on the door: do it.
A guy who lived in the same dorm with me had a policy that if a door wasn't locked, then he was invited in.
He's seen a lot of things.
Make friends cooking.
Since you start university in Bake-Off fever, if you knock on someone's door to get acquainted and carry a plate of brownies, it seems less strange, less like the situation of the '50s, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've cooked something for you, now smile and I ask personal questions."
Home-cooked goods are a great way to make friends.
Your co-lodgers will feel obligated to talk and may end up associating your face with a tasty surprise.
Obviously, you must be a good cook.
Flour, sugar and fat lumps will most likely cause others to pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Obviously, wiping someone's chicken is stealing, but taking a drop of milk to put in your tea is stealing too?

If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and I understand you -- you're still trying to tackle the problem more mature than my dorm mate, who colored his milk with liquid detergent to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
Don't make noise that won't let others sleep or study.
That's not just because it's common sense, but because you literally walk on glass.
A girl on the floor with me asked her neighbor to turn the music down because it was 3: 00 in the morning and she had an exam this morning.
Their reaction was to turn the music up.
When they finally stopped the music at 5: 00 in the morning, the girl was kind enough to let them sleep for two hours before turning on the music, she locked the door and went on the three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband / future wife moved on to the same floor?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extremely strange if you mistook a mate of the floor for your future husband, would you hook up, break up, and you should meet each other every day and maybe even watch him take over all your mutual friends?
Of course, you can't resist the heart - but if a sexy mate of the floor is certainly not your future husband, at least try to be rational.
In the thrilling moment when you realize that someone left their keys in the unopened room, the line between farce and intimidation is finer than it looks.
A successful farce is funny, but it can distort in a few moments.
You teach a funny and valuable safety lesson by hiding something - but never dirty someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and put the keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer - but don't stick someone's goods to the ceiling more than twice.
Violinist David Grimal: In Bach's era there were no world tournaments.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people, artists and not commercial representatives.
French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as a soloist but also as the initiator of a less ordinary project, quite "strange," as he says himself, Les Dissonances - an orchestra formed by international singers and talented musicians, who interpret a symphonic repertoire without having a conductor, and that makes her at least a curiosity in the classical musical landscape.
Les Dissonances was at the Enescu Festival this year with two performances: a performance, on Sunday, in which the soloist was David Grimal, founder of the orchestra, and one month, when the violinist Xavier Phillips was at the forefront, the works composed by Enescu were without lack.
Both performances on the Athenaeum stage showed the audience a different way of playing classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the stage in 2004 as the only classical musical ensemble in which there was no conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It is true, on the one hand, musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become performers in an orchestra - they speak of instrumentalists, and not of composers.
They're formed as "specialized workers."
They themselves think they need a conductor.
On the other side of the stage, for the public, all musical fetisization focuses on the conductor.
And so, business, the music industry, is marketing.
So we don't talk about music anymore.
So, if we look at this world, we have on the one hand skilled workers, which is stupid, and an audience that can't listen, but you have to watch, which is stupid again, "considers David Grimal.
The violinist tells that this change in the way he makes music came from his "musical perceptions" career as a soloist.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise around the world with different orchestras, to earn a lot of money and bring money to the music industry.
10 years ago, when I was about 30, I found this very depressing, because I no longer found the creativity and the human brotherhood in this system.
So, I've never found any sense in continuing on this road.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This was in 2004, and at the time no one would do such a thing without a conductor: "The music world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects."
"How do you imagine marketing with a collective of musicians where there is no ego?" the artist asks.
David Grimal admits that Les Dissonaces is "a luxury," stating that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depend on the success of this project to live.
In 10 years of the existence of the ensemble, the absence of a conductor did not prove to be a hindrance in the musical act: "Curiously, the more complex a repertoire, the simpler it seems, because all musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not just in the role," Grimal claims, adding that at Sunday's show "we were 74 conductors on stage."
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is a "very brave one," precisely because it invited Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where the largest orchestras in the world are present and play three times a day, and in the midst of these orchestras you also invited this strange group."
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there was the place and interest in something different, breaking barriers.
Speaking of Enescu's work, the violinist admits that he feels the Romanian music of the famous Roman composer, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced Enescu's works into his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but this is what happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "because there is also a George Enescu who made French music."
Grimal advocates changing the way classical musical education is done, considering that "the profession of musician, as organized today, has a sense of death" and that "the future of music represents music itself."
We don't need to tour the world five times a year if it's no use.
In Bach's era, there were no world tournaments.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, the organization of concerts, festivals, tournaments, the release of albums, they're all formidable, extraordinary, but as long as they're done in the service of music.
If not, we're in a system where creativity suffers, has no freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal set the example of Romanian products before and after joining the European Union: "In Romania, before entering the EU, you had vegetables and good meat."
To enter the EU you had to adopt sanitary laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture end up serving supermarkets, as they do in France.
With music the same thing happens, it's the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes tomatoes maybe not too pretty, but when we cut them they're real tomatoes.
In an ideal world, this music should return to the center and that the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
"If we considered - as the Koreans do, the Chinese, the Japanese - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we would reintroduce his teaching in school, we would reintroduce concerts on television, and through this education we would no longer need to sell musical by-products," Grimal believes.
Surely, there are things in classical musical education that remain very communist, that everywhere, is something very militarised.
It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician to a soldier, or if we form a musician who will play an instrument, being, above all, a musician.
We are talking about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) must be somehow, if we want to form a musician, it is something else entirely.
According to you, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?, "asks the French artist smiling.
Grimal shows that, for artists, the reward of another kind of music comes from overcoming this status of "soldier," exceeding what "they think are their limits": "Musicians discover at a certain point that there are no soldiers, and that's why after the concert they come out smiling."
David Grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision of music and artist at the "Festival of Ideas," a discussion with the public organized at the George Enescu International Festival by the Aspen Romania Institute.
Profile David Grimal
After following the Conservatoire National Superior de Musique in Paris under the guidance of Regis Pasquier, during which he received advice and encouragement from renowned artists such as Schlomo Mintz and Isaac Stern, David Grimal studied for a year at the Ecole des Science Politiques in Paris before meeting Philippe Hirshhorn, who changed the course of his life.
David Grimal has an international career as a solo violinist, during which he regularly performed in the last 20 years on the main scenes of classical music of the world and with prestigious orchestras such as the Paris Orchestra, the Philharmonic Orchestra of Radio France, the Russian National Orchestra, the National Orchestra of Lyon, the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, the Berliner Symphoniker, the New Japan Philharmonic, the Orchestra of L'Opera of Lyon, the Mozarteum Orchestra Salzburg, the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra of Europe, and the Sinfonia Varsovia, under the direction of some conductors such as the Orchestre de Lyons, and the Orchestre de Lyons of Orchestre de Lyn.
He was the recipient of works with dedication from several composers, including Marc-Andre Dalbavie, Brice Pauset, Thierry Escaich, Jean-Francois Zygel, Alexander Gasparov, Victor Kissine, Fumini Tanada, Richard Dubugnon, Ivan Fedele, Philippe Harrowing, Anders Hillborg, Oscar Bianchi, Guillaume Connesson and Frederick Verrieres.
In addition to his solo career as an artist, David Grimal kept exploring more personal projects.
The freedom offered by his collaboration with Les Dissonances allowed him to develop his inner universe by venturing into repertoires that are not accessible to solo artists.
Along with Les Dissonances, he set up "L'Autre Saison," a series of concerts for the benefit and together with homeless people at the Saint-Leo church, located in the heart of Paris.
Since 2008, David Grimal has been an artist at the Dijon Opera.
He teaches violin classes at Musikhochschule in Sarrebruck, Germany.
He also took many courses in mastery and was a member of the jury of the International Long-Thibaud Competition in Paris in 2010.
He was awarded the Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres award by the French Minister of Culture in 2008.
David Grimal played on a Stradivarius, "ex Roederer" in 1710, as well as on "Don Quixote," a violin designed for him by the French lutier Jacques Fustier.
David Grimal was present at this year's George Enescu International Festival with the Les Dissonances Orchestra on Sunday, with Debussy, Enescu and Beethoven.
Les Dissonances also took the stage on Monday, this time with cellist Xavier Phillips in the foreground, and the program was composed of Schnittke, Enescu and Brahms.
Cinema City is looking for "Little Big Voices"
Cinema City launches the greatest challenge for children: doubling of two characters from the superproduction "Snow Queen 3D"
Do you have a super talented, spontaneous kid who likes movies?
Give him a chance to be a star.
In September, as part of the newest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, eager to become future stars and aged between 8 and 16, Cinema City searches for "Little Big Voices," giving them the extraordinary opportunity to double two characters from a famous animated film.
If the classical drawings focus on bringing the voice of the actor closer to the specific character animated, in recent times, the creation of the story also takes into account those who are to interpret the voices, and they are usually very well known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices, and that is why we are starting a new campaign.
We want to find the right voice and challenge our parents to enroll their children in our contest.
They will have a special experience, because the characters are nice and the lines are funny.
"Children will have fun and a real chance to be part of a team of actors," Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania said.
In the first stage of the competition, from 11 September to 30 September, Cinema City will organize a pre-selection, which will elect 10 children (five girls and five boys) who will have the opportunity to audition in a recording studio with professionals.
All parents have to do is access the micilochimari.cinema-city.ro platform, where they can enter the child in the contest and prepare him for the voice test.
Subsequently, they must choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is to read and then, the child will register by performing his own version of doubling.
Four films about friendship, fairy-tale heroes, magic and hope can choose the contestants to support the challenge: "Fene Yellow 3D," "Mune: Guardian of the Moon 3D," "Blinky Bill: Koala cel poznaÈ 3D" and "Albinuta Maya 3D."
Finally, the two most talented children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream come true and will double one character from the superproduction "The Snow Queen - The Snow Queen 3D Queen," which will be premiered in Romania in November of this year.
FedEx wins are mixed, tax forecasts decrease for 2016
FedEx declared disappointing results for the last quarter, with the delivery giant reducing profit estimates for the whole year as a result of low demand for transport services and increased costs for its land transport division.
The company also said it plans to employ around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
During the same period last year, FedEx announced that it would employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The company's shares decreased by about 2.5% in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening bell.
FedEx Corp. said he expects to win between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in May of next year, 20 cents less, according to a previous estimate.
Analysts predicted the figure of $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The decreasing estimate comes despite the increase in prices by 4.9% on average, with entry into force on 4 January and the higher surcharges for land transport of large or large packages, to be applied since November.
The company said it still expects to increase gains from the previous year due to lower costs, higher revenues and online trade development.
The President and CEO Fred Smith stated that "the firm is facing a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, especially in terms of global production and trade."
Commitment plans during the holidays were announced a day after the UPS competitor said he plans to employ 90,000-95,000 additional workers, about the same number of employees he made last year.
In the quarter that ended on 31 August, FedEx won $692 million, 6% more than the previous year.
The earnings per share were $2.42, under the average estimate of $2.44 per share made by 12 analysts who responded to the Zacks Investment Research survey.
Profit increased by 5%, up to 12.3 billion dollars.
Six analysts who participated in the Zacks survey estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, leading to stagnation of revenue recorded by its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping picked up the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, the income of the ground division has increased by 29% but operational revenue has basically stagnated due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in revenue due to higher basic tariffs, while the income recorded by the freight division decreased due to increasing costs.
At pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening sound, FedEx's shares had dropped by $3.85 or 2.5% at $150.15.
Tuesday at closing had fallen by 11% at year level and by 17% at the peak recorded on 11 June.
At the most expected meeting in recent years, policy makers from the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table to decide whether it is time to increase a key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Above them, at the end of the central bank meeting room, a mural of the United States will be seen.
The map is meant to remind that Janet L. Yellen, President of the Fed, and his colleagues must put the nation's economic interests above all else.
The Central Bank has been given a double task by Congress: maximize the employment rate in the US and maintain price stability.
But since the great economic crisis, the Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be factor X in a decision that is too difficult to predict, which will be announced on Tuesday, and will determine whether the US economy is ready to be unleashed by the unprecedented incentive offered by the near zero short-term interest rate in force since the end of 2008.
Even though most data indicate a growing economy, recent agitation in global financial markets could scare Fed officials already cautious of adding volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds - even by only a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main issues they will pursue," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think that if they were looking for an excuse not to increase the interest rate, the growing uncertainty on the world market is enough to give them arguments to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on the decision that the Fed will make, which in itself causes instability in the financial market.
About half of Bloomberg's recent economists anticipated an increase in interest rate this week.
But the financial markets expect the Fed to delay, a key indicator showing that the likelihood of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a drop on the stock exchange if the Fed increased the interest rate, unless policymakers would alleviate the blow by promising that it would be a long time before the next increase.
On Tuesday, industrial media Dow Jones climbed 228,89 points, or 1.4%, up to 16.599.85.
The increase was triggered by expectations that the Fed decision-makers would maintain the stable interest rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising for the Fed to increase the interest rate at this point," Lonski said.
If Fed decision-makers were to do so, "they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in financial markets."
Other experts stated that an increase in the interest rate would calm financial markets as it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed would act.
Just a month ago, the Fed appeared to be about to increase the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards the slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that he expected an increase in the interest rate this year despite the liberal objections that more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth was strong this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to the level considered by the Fed as total employment.
Wage gains showed signs of growth.
And although inflation continued not to achieve the annual target of the central bank, the Fed decision-makers claimed that a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply falling oil prices.
The economy "can cope at higher rates and needs them, given the tension in the labour market," said Ian Neudson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets began to deteriorate at the end of this month, after China devalued its currency.
Industrial media Dow Jones fell 16% below the top record reached in May, as investors feared the slowing down of the Chinese economy would bring down global growth.
The market has somewhat reculated this month, with the Dow index now about 10% below the peak in May.
For the Fed decision-makers, the market agitation shall be added to the complex calculation of the moment of the interest rate increase.
"Without what has happened in the financial markets and news of the weakening of the Chinese economy in recent weeks, they would be stronger at the hearing," said Stephen D. Oliner, an experienced researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former official Fed.
Now, he predicts they'll wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about which impact will be on the US economy, and they almost have no data to base it on after the events in China," Oliner said.
The well-being of the global economy is not one of the major interests of the Fed, so basically it should not be taken into account in decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed became the global monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been huge.
The mere allusion of then President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "narrow" its monetary expansion triggered an earthquake in global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials are expected not only to monitor progress in other areas, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
Its decision-making process is "more art than science," Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy department of the company managing the well-being of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., said this month that "The Fed has an oversized reaction history to changes in the financial market that appear to be unrelated to economic bases."
Lacker, a member with the right to vote of the Federal Commission for the Open Market, a decision-making body, which supported the increase in the interest rate, provided the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
A financial crisis affecting Asia led the Fed to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% in three meetings, "despite the limited identification implications for the US development," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials returned to their respective falls.
The Fed should raise the issue of financial stability first only in the event of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market earthquake, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England interest rate committee.
The last hectic period is nowhere near up to that level, he said.
"We certainly do not want to get to the point of fear of an increase in the interest rate because the markets were upset," said Posen, President Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in this respect, I do not think it should take premature action.

Seven's Sunrise dominates the polls, despite the Nine Channel attempts to broadcast on the Today Show about changing party leadership
The urgent movement of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to convey on the subject of the consequences of changes from the liberal party leadership did not bring a significant increase in the audience for Today.
The morning show of the Nine Canal broadcast from the capital after Tony Abbott's defeat in front of Malcolm Turnbull.
The competing Sunrise show, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was caught in London as part of a series of broadcasts over several weeks, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This "cruelty" of distance did not seem to matter much to Aussie TV viewers, with Sunrise having an audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today saw a slight increase compared to Monday's (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but the figures were lower than last Thursday's (343,000).
Today has narrowed the gap from Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000.
For now, in September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
This morning, not only is Parliament affected by the current change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!

The main story was the stunning debut of the 800 Words series, starring former star from Packed to the Rafters, Erik Thomson.
The new drama, with a newly widowed father, who decides to move with his two children to the coast of New Zealand, had a very impressive average audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson was able to handle a show alone without the star of Rafters, Rebecca Gibney.
Audience results for last night responded resounding that "yes."
Seven's X Factor show was held by 1,136 million viewers, easily facing The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven recorded ups and downs the second night he broadcast The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17: 00 to 17: 30) of Andrew O'Keefe's new show of moderate general culture had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17: 30 to 18: 00) rose to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat show (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia show had an average audience of 520,000 viewers and the second half recorded a huge number of 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
The fall in the audience recorded by Chase Australia on the second evening will give Nine tacit confidence that Hot Seat will eventually triumph at 5: 30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaces the Million Dollar Minutes, which failed to defeat McGuire's show.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Hodorkovski, the richest man in Russia, was arrested at gunpoint at an airport in Sibera.
As he openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Hodorkovski was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was seized and his pro-democratic efforts were diminished.
4 people lost their lives after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets in the crowd demonstrating against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said Wednesday.
Violence occurred on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, approximately 280 km west of the capital of Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the head of the district police, more than 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station, and some of them threw stones and molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal claimed that police forces used tear gas and then fired shots in the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
The collision was the last event after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the ethnic group Madhesi claim that the new provinces established under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
Protests also existed in western Nepal, where the ethnic group Tharus wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 policemen, were killed in violent clashes triggered on August 10th,
when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step towards a new constitution but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for hundreds of years.
The procedure for drafting a new constitution was started in 2008, but legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
This week, in Kathmandu, legislators voted on the clauses in the draft constitution and officials said the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We won't use wire fences, dogs, cops and guns
The prime minister shall continue to exchange lines with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of the Government meeting Wednesday, Ponta reiterated Romania's firm stance on the refugee crisis.
We are making every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania disagrees and will not apply anti-democratic measures, guard dogs, wire fences or gun cops.
"It is a shame for 21st century Europe to apply methods from the 30s." said Victor Ponta
"The prime minister also said that all data and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and set at the CSAT meeting on Thursday." The prime minister concluded.
NHC announces 60% cyclone probability south of Cape Verde Islands
A large low-pressure front about 560 km south of Cape Verde's southernmost point is 60% likely to turn into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the US National Hurricane Centre said Tuesday.
Another well-defined low pressure front about halfway between Cape Verde Islands and Lesser Antilles also shows a 60% probability of forming a tropical cyclone in the next two days, the Miami meteorologist added.
Weight loss surgery could be useful in cases of mild obese diabetes
The benefits of weight loss surgery for people with mild obesity with type 2 diabetes could be maintained for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to say whether slightly obese diabetics live longer after weight loss surgery than those undergoing nonsurgical treatments.
"It takes a long time to centralize mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, who wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations, also called bariatric surgery, use various methods to lower the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in morbid obese individuals with a body mass index (BMI) 35 or higher.
The BMI, a unit of weight in relation to height, is considered normal between 18,5 and 24,9.
The BMI value of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and people with BMI above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your IMC by accessing: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastrectomy in the sleeve - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in people with mild obesity.
The average BMI in people undergoing surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in the study.
Meanwhile, BMI in people who received non-surgical diabetes treatments remained almost at the same level, namely 29.
Of those undergoing surgery, diabetes completely healed at 36% and partly at 28%.
In the medically treated group, by comparison, diabetes completely healed in only 1% and partly in only 2% of subjects.
In addition, the control of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad 'LDL cholesterol were generally better in the surgical group," the authors concluded.
Researchers also monitored the blood level of Hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood glucose levels over time.
Researchers write that the optimal level of haemoglobin A1c is below 7%.
After surgery, the mean haemoglobin level A1c decreased from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the medical group, approximately 8% was maintained.
However, this improved "glycaemic control" - reflected by improved levels of haemoglobin A1c - did not reduce the mortality rate to five years, according to chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year compared to the gastrectomy group in the sleeve, the bypass surgery group lost more weight (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), had more significant decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% versus 2.1%) and had a higher probability of complete remission of diabetes (46.9% versus 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study conducted in people with high weight in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, Blackstone says, from the University of Arizona, the Faculty of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery were approximately 29% less likely to die after 15 years compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit in patients undergoing surgery, Blackstone stated that it is an optimistic aspect for people with BMI below 35 interested in the procedure.
"This is the point where this work is critical because it states that this surgery is safe in the lower BMI group," without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, she says.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start to take their weight seriously when the patient's BMI reaches 27-30.
"I think we wait too long to urge people to take this issue seriously," she said.
I think that once they've accumulated these genetic changes that have shortened their bodies to obesity and diabetes, it's extremely difficult to get back to normal.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not receive all the refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader made a call to end violence in the refugee mother countries.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the current problem of the refugee crisis in her speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethical studies, at the beginning of her 10-day visit to Britain.
He said that, in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of every nation and even every continent.
He also stressed that although admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to care for a few thousand refugees, but at the same time we need to think about long-term solutions to bring peace and sincere development, especially through education, in Muslim countries," he stressed.
After all, we need to think about ways to reduce crimes in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force never solved these problems, "he added.
On the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9 / 11 terrorist attacks, saying that the violent response by the US generated a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the events of September 11th, I sent my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to resolve this problem without resorting to violence.
I know his motives were strong but he used force and caused unexpected consequences, "said the Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who ingested hand detergent in the last 4 years
According to the Georgia Anti-Poison Centre, US Anti-Poison Centres reported an increase of about 400% since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallowed hand detergent with high alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Anti-Poison Centre, cases of hand detergent ingestion in children under the age of 12 reported at the Anti-Poison Centres rose from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"Children have more frequent access to these products and, unfortunately, a percentage of them reach the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said that some children deliberately drink detergent and others do it to impress their friends or respond to challenges on social networks.
On YouTube can be watched movies that show teenagers drinking detergent to create cheap drinks.
It seems that teenagers have mixed detergent with mouthwash with alcohol to get a stronger drink.
Younger children can be attracted to the attractive scent of the detergent.
"A child doesn't think he's hurting her," Lopez says.
Many of the most attractive types (hand detergent) are the fragrant ones.
Strawberry, grape, orange hand detergents are the most attractive for children.
The hand detergent contains approximately 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few bites can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's very concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the anti-poisoning center at Kansas University Hospital, for the Fox 4 channel in Kansas City.
So we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand detergents in accessible places, and if the little ones get to them, that's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested at school the equivalent of four sprays with strawberry-flavored hand detergent, arrived at the emergency room to receive treatment.
She had alcohol 179, twice the threshold at which an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, a doctor at the emergency room who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was babbling and couldn't go when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital to identify signs of brain damage because the girl fell and hit her head because of the alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free wet products or napkins and to keep hand detergent out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing hand detergent containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-graders in northern New York plotted to poison their "bad" teacher by putting antibacterial products in the classroom, according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand detergent and banned him in his classroom.
The police considered the plan to be "insignificant" and put forward the disciplinary issue to the school inspectorate.

The penalty of ADAM Rooney in the first half brought Aberdeen a close victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie, with Dons getting a five-point difference between them and Celtic.
Griffiths dismantle misunderstandings
There were rumors of misunderstandings at Celtic, dismantled by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his team should not be subjected to increased pressure given that they are preparing to face the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we're feeling the pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The absence of Scots in the title race bores the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch international player Ronald de Boer said Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic - because they do not fight for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, currently ambassador of Ajax, said: "In the Netherlands I no longer transmit the summary of Celtic matches; why?"
Because the Rangers aren't there.
Here, it's not just about getting the Rangers back.
They're talking about Old Firm.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's where the interest is going.
The tension is high in the Old Firm matches and it's not just the Scots who want to see these matches.
I'll change the situation, promise Deila.
Ronny Deila accepted that Celtic was struggling hard, but the Norwegian chief promised to change the situation.
The defeat with Malmo and the subsequent elimination from the Champions League were followed by the defeat in front of Aberdeen, who played in 10 people, now at the top of the ranking with a five-point lead.
But Deila said, "Celtic has had periods before and will recover."
We want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what's going on.
We feel the same way - but we have to move on.
We absolutely need Celtic's support because this makes the players better.
It is extremely important that we remain united now.
Warburton's prudence regarding the January transfers
Despite comments just a few weeks ago suggesting that he had identified several targets for the January transfers, the head of the Rangers, Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting that he does not wish to affect the Ibrox unit.
The former head of Brentford said: "The period of transfers in January is very different from that of the summer."
In the case of the players transferred in the summer, there is the period before the season in which they can be integrated, which you have been able to observe this season in our group.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes you do more harm if you bring in players that aren't needed.
Celtic targets Michu after withdrawal
The striker from Swansea, Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested that he could withdraw on the expiry of his contract with Swans.
The 29-year-old player struggled for two years with ankle problems and failed to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts faces SFA on Neilson's comments
Hearts were driving 2-1 when Paterson was voted out and lost 3-2, but the quarterback's red card was then cancelled - the third red card was cancelled in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting: "I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance."
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The invincible Hibee was taken for granted after he admitted to singing a song with offensive lyrics about the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in March 2014 in a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh before a derby with Edinburgh in Tynecastle.
"It was derby and it was the excitement of the moment," the striker said, adding: "There is no need to say that I am not going back to Tynecastle unless I play for Celtic."
Tannadice Council trusts Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United board still trusts that the management team will change the situation - but agrees that the decline in the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We will bring the boys back into shape, "Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy for his "dirty victory" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes acknowledges that the Aberdeen team must hold on desperately to Hamilton Acries in order to achieve the seventh successive win in the league, which brought them five points to Celtic due to the first round penalty strike by Adam Rooney.
McInnes said: "There is no team that has won anything, in the cup or league, and that has not won matches like this."
The unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged while in the UK it increases
The unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged, being 164,000 between May and July, while the number of unemployed in the UK increased by 10,000, reaching 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate of 5.9% in Scotland was higher than in the UK, 5.5%, according to figures submitted by the National Statistics Office (ONS).
Meanwhile, the employment rate in Scotland decreased by 12.000 over the three-month period, with the number of employees currently employed being 2,612.000.
The employment rate in Scotland decreased in that quarter to 74.0% - a figure above the average of 73.5 in the UK.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The long-term plan of authorities laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It has been almost a year since Scotland made its historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen improvements in the labour market in Scotland, with the employment rate increasing and the unemployment rate falling.
Why am I witnessing an execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will watch a man be sentenced to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in a observatory room in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary execution room and watching Richard Glossip be executed by administering the lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation came first in January, through his best friend, and though I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day approaches in question, I'm terrified of the idea.
So, why should I?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of capital punishment.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It is true, journalists can witness executions in America and, because requests usually exceed the number of seats available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma reduced the number of seats reserved for media representatives from 12 to five.
The chosen will look at the execution with impartiality.
I can't do that.
I would sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, plus I developed my own connection to him over the months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to carry a notebook and a pen to write down what I see.
I'm gonna have to try and remember all the details.
A journalist in Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he wishes, get access.
I complained about her.
He admitted that "he could have done better," but he still thinks I'm wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
Don't tell me what to write and I wouldn't do it if he asked me to.
I told him he could take me off the witness list anytime.
But he wants an international report to be present to write on the subject.
He believes that if he dies, publicity will help the movement against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, Huffington Post reporter, will be with me.
If you want to learn more about the case, listen to the multimedia file series that we made.
I won't come back here on all the details.
I can't say for certain that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese make him guilty of complicity.
But I think it's very likely he's not guilty of murder.
I believe with certainty that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'm going to watch him die from that perspective.
I can't pretend to be totally objective.
For this, you can read the articles written by other reporters.
From me you'll find out what it's like to watch a man I like die needlessly.
Peter Moody claims that the stewards tried to spy on him and threaten to pull out of the races.
Peter Moody claimed that Stewards Racing Victoria tried to infiltrate a spy at his stables last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the races.
He launched an attack against the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they are conducting a personal campaign against him, the drop that filled the glass being the elimination of Lady Tatai from the race due to a treatment administered on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do the best for the racing field and that he is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result of Lidari's cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months, he swallowed his words about the statements about spies and did not want to look like "the fox that does not reach the grapes."
"I wasn't going to say anything about that, and I've been quiet for a long time, but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that it all comes out all of a sudden," Moody said.
It's been known to continue.
Sometimes you react and you have to face the consequences, and I'm gonna have to live with what I said.
Tonight I'll go home and sleep peacefully.
I want to go with my head up, and I want the owners I work with to see that I'm trying to give them the best.
From the moment they start to believe that this is not the case, I have to give up my job as a trainer.
At that point, I'm gonna have to think about what I'm gonna do with my certification.
Previously, Moody dropped the bomb in a given interview for racing.com in which he stated that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stables.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man -- whose name I will say if asked -- and offered to hire him at my stables to provide information about the work there," Moody told Racing.com. He said.
He obviously thinks I'm a cheater.
If so, then they should all resign because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of the RVL, David Moodie, current president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, knew at the time and know today.
Am I supposed to think it's personal?
Is it necessary for the RVL to start to have backbone and be able to hold off people outside the trainers for what is happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on industry?
Is my influence on industry that bad?
Maybe that's how the others see it.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that the statements that I'm making right now could make them think about that.
But I've come to the point where I don't care anymore and that makes me sad.
It makes me very sad.
I'll put pressure on and get them to make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The frustration of the trainer increased with the long investigation of cobalt testing in which Lidari was involved and the elimination led him to assert that he could "put his license on the table."
Moody, whose name is most often associated with the training of the undefeated Black Caviar champion, has labeled the rule of treatment on the day of the race as "ridiculous" after a mud or clay cataplasm has been applied to the horses' legs, which violates the rules.
He's breaking race rules.
I have to take full responsibility for this, "he says.
One of my employees accidentally put mud on his leg.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, which it did.
It happened the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for the treatment on the day of the race consisting of the application of the cataplasm, for which the stewarders have opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that rules are needed but it has gone too far," Moody said.
The driver who hit and ran from the crash site in Cobram was arrested
Police arrested a man after a collision with a bicyclist produced in Cobram at the end of the week and followed by a hit-and-run.
The rider was transported by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, being seriously injured after being hit Saturday morning by a car on the Murray Valley highway.
Police representatives say the driver of the vehicle did not stop to help the injured bicycle driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old male turned himself in to the Shepparton police.
It appears he will be charged with fleeing the scene of the accident, not providing first aid and other road offences.
The bicyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains hospitalized, stable.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, answers to his opponents on the wrestling charges.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, named the criticism of the tackle tactics used by his team as "distorted subjects" brought up by the two main favorites in the NRL.
Coach Sydney Roosters, Trent Robinson, said that the referees allowed the Storm players to "slam" his team in the game won by Storm in the qualifying finals played in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos' coach, Wayne Bennett, made a slight reference to Storm after his team's victory in the North Queensland Cowboys qualifying match, played on Saturday night, when he named that match a rugby league "demonstration" and said the two Queensland teams were not very good at wrestling.
Bellamy jumped in defense of the tackle tactics approached by his team and said the players were simply focusing on "contact" when they were playing.
Bellamy says he gained confidence after two major coaches criticized his team, which means they were worried Storm would beat them.
"And things don't stop here - we didn't hear Trent Robinson complain about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques, except that in the last six weeks we've really put the focus on contact in plaques and so we've changed the situation.
Trent has been in this position for three years and obviously has a wonderful team so he's probably not used to losing and it was a shock to him.
Funny how it always happens this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "animating football," reminding his mentor St George-Illawarra Dragons of Bennett won the 2010 championship playing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about thrilling football.
He argued his opinion by comparing Saturday night's game to our Friday night game and talking about how exciting the game was, "Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010, St. George got a lot of criticism because it was a boring team and Wayne said he didn't give a damn about it.
But now he's got a team that can play what we would consider to be thrilling football, especially because of the fast young midgets.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have players like that.
He brought this argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his style of play - not every team has two midfielder like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're somewhat concerned about the game with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they were thinking about the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm-Roosters match was a tougher score-related match compared to the Broncos-Cowboys match.
The Broncos game was probably a good match, haven't we seen it yet, what was the score?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, is that exciting game?
Or is it exciting to take breaks and not score?
There are plans for me.
If they're talking about us, it means that at some point we could meet them.
Storm is free this weekend because they won the right to play at home with either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks, in the final of next Saturday's preliminaries at AAMI Park, the tickets being put on sale starting next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used the little girls' phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures.
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she was asleep and then logged into an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of indecent images with children as the subject.
The girl woke up later and noticed the disappearance of the phone, which she found in Hogg's hand while he was asleep.
He looked in the phone and found disturbing messages and immediately alerted his mother.
After arrival, police saw the five photos then analyzed computers found at the address and found "worrying" searches on the Internet using terms to find indecent images of children's subjects.
Hogg claimed he did it to "attract pedophiles" on the Internet before "pretending to be a cop to scare them."
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson said to the Dundee court: "He said he is an addiction - he is addicted to scaring people.
He admitted he did the computer search, but he said he did it because he wanted to pretend to be a cop to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations he had with the unknown person who sent him the images and the fact that he asked the person to send him more pictures.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said that he no longer thinks clearly when he drinks and that he wants to see images of rape and murder.
Mr Robertson added, "When the little girl found the messages on her phone, she called out to her mother and she was shaking and crying.
The little girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the defendant was confronted.
The little girl was interviewed and told that the defendant was using the computer and the Playstation to talk to girls who seemed much younger than him.
Last year, on 14 June, Hogg, 23 years old, residing in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to allegations that he had taken or taken indecent pictures of child subjects, and violated the conditions of his parole on 25 January this year and did not appear before the court at the appearance of 24 March this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be registered in the sex offenders' register because it can be said that this crime "did not involve a significant sexual aspect."
Judge Alistair Carmichael postponed his sentence until October for reasons of social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in this file but remained in custody before the appearance of other files.
It was entered in the sex offenders' register before the sentence was given.
Robert Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe, delivered the wrong speech in Parliament
At the beginning of the year, Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
He was not injured, but the fall video became viral on social media.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disrupted by representatives of the opposition who said they had received anonymous death threats, threatening not to boo Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they booed him during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The head of Parliament's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones, warning them not to disturb Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent by a hidden number but it is called" death, "he told the journalists after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the MPs concerned that immunity applies only in Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity is worthless.
The head of the parliamentary group said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "worried" about threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will make 30,000 layoffs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 redundancies as part of the company's efforts to restructure and reduce costs in the services sector.
This year. HP will split into two companies on the stock exchange, separating the division from computers and printers from corporate hardware operations and services that are on the rise.
The expected availability will cost about $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, HP said.
"These restructurings will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and sustainable cost structure," said Meg Whitman, the president and CEO of HP, who will lead the unit after the rupture.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP at present and will have a large business portfolio that will contribute to the transition of companies to the new business style," Whitman said.
By operating as a separate company, we are better placed than ever to meet the growing requirements of our global customers.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of over $50 billion and "will focus on providing integrated solutions without a rival" to companies.
A company formed in 1930 by graduates of Stanford University, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, is divided into the production of electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was called the Silicon Valley cradle.
HP has undergone a massive reorganization to adapt to the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The measure taken by HP, the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology companies in the US, is the latest in the field, based on the idea that companies that focus their attention better in a direction have a better performance.
FrienddsFest: The comedy series that taught us important lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar characters in the series is obvious, given that the need for men to open is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among young men reaching the top of the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the main cause of death in men aged 20-45 years in the UK, and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the problem, the Campaign Against Life Miserably (CALM) designated 2015 as the Year of Man, wanting to question the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to succeed this challenge.
A recent study conducted on more than 2000 high school students with symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends "with a healthy mood," his chances of recovery are doubled.
To the same extent, for people who are not depressed, a circle of healthy mental friends reduces the likelihood of mental disorders by half.
Of course, in order for friendship to work, it must first be accessible.
In this era of communication dominated by social networks, where emphasis is placed on style rather than substance, the immediate nature of the response often takes precedence over meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to fun and success, even though it is actually isolation that dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all with the cost of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - that affect our mental health even more deeply.
Billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money really doesn't buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it focused attention on this idea.
The characters were not defined by the workplace but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, the moments when they watch football in the comfortable chairs, and Ross's passion for Rachel came from knowing that men can relate to this situation, even though they often avoid exploring their feelings completely.
As a social worker explained to me:... "my role of listening to people with suicidal and depressed tendencies has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference."
Often, people who turn to us don't feel able to talk to friends.
The old saying to handle yourself is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as weak if you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to provide more psychological adjustment mechanisms in the long term.
The series highlighted small moments of male friendship.
As much as it helps objective, outside intervention through the phone, people in desperate times, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
Thus, if you attend this weekend at the FrienddsFest organized by Comedy Central, with full playback of the set to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends for coffee in Central Perk.
Or better yet, if you see anyone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends is aired by Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - on occasion # FriendsFest
Di Maria marks and helps PSG to give Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates alongside Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on Tuesday in his debut match in the Champions League and helped the PSG to stand up to the Swedish team Malmo.
Next we present the match chronicle and reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their duty, as Paris Saint-Germain began the series of matches in the Champions League, with a reassuring 2-0 victory against Malmo in the match played on Tuesday at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of her debut in the Champions League on the PSG team, bringing the French champions to the advantage, though they missed a number of occasions before securing their advantage with the goal marked by Cavani in minute 61.
Having reached Group A with Real Madrid and Shahtior Donetsk, Paris needed a strong start against Swedish champions because the objective of the French team is not only to qualify in the eights but also to improve the journey to the quarter finals in each of the last three tournaments.
However, although they took the points, Laurent Blanc's students were away from a perfect painting, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic who wasted the opportunity of being replaced by the team in his hometown and the club where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or on your way to the Champions League, so winning 2-0 causes problems for our opponents and sets a comfortable difference from the next ranking, even if there are still aspects that we need to perfect during the season," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win, and we did, although I'm sorry we failed to score one or two more goals.
Ibrahim returned after the injury to one of the three changes to the Paris team, with a 2-2 draw from Bordeaux's home in League 1 at the weekend, but Di Maria took the spotlight in the fourth minute.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine offensive midfielder was named the man who would take the PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he sprang at Marco Verratti's care behind Malmo's defense before he shot incredibly over Johan Wiland, in the long corner on the right side of the gate.
But if anyone expected PSG to win by snapping their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in play-off to get to this stage and entered the field with nine national team holders, with a five-man defense and two defensive midfielder, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, except for Nikola Djurdjic's kick that passed Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute.
Instead, PSG players slowed the pace several times, giving a few unnecessary passes and not completing the interventions, even Ibrahim who missed no less than five attempts just in the first half and was then replaced by Cavani right after the resumption of the game.
However, Ibrahim proved much better at supporting his colleagues, as he cared about what Di Maria sent in a derelict shot by Wiland across the gate in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally scored after one hour of the match, thanks to Cavani, the ruguayan who scored the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahim passed from Maxwell's centre.
This goal eliminated Malmo's hope that they would rebalance the score and only a superb stop for Wiland at a distance to reject David Luiz maintained the final score before Ezequiel Lavezzi's new entry was cancelled a goal in overtime.
The Norwegian coach of the Malmo team, Age Hareide, later claimed that the PSG were a class over and that "The last match I played in the Champions League was last December."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which does not rise to the same level.
Qualifications aren't enough.
Hats off to PSG.
They made an excellent game.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion from stock sales
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by the drop in stock prices on the stock exchange, raised $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of a large debt reduction plan.
Glencore, quoted on the London Stock Exchange, said it sold new shares worth 1.6 billion pounds to pay off the debt.
After losing 57% of its market value this year, the company is clinging to prices on the stock exchange, because the decrease in Chinese economic activity influences demand and causes disaster in the markets.
The preferential subscription right increased the price of Glencore shares on the London stock exchange in Wednesday morning's transactions.
The shares increased by 2.77% to 131,60 shillings at the FTSE 100 index, which opened at a value of 0.69% higher.
Glencore revealed the sale of $2.5 billion worth of shares as part of the larger plans to cover nearly a third of his $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at 125 shillings per share, 2.4% less than Tuesday's closing price.
He took 1.3 billion shares out of the company, representing 9.99% of the group.
The concern over the growth of the Chinese economy in prolonged stagnation has led to a substantial increase in iron ore prices by about half, and coal, copper and other commodities have decreased by 20-40%.
Xi urges the wider expansion of the global economy
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a reform group that the economy needs to open up to the outside world to feed growth.
"China needs to commit to attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving openness policies," Xi said at the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group on the Continuation of General Reforms (Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform).
Promoting openness and encouraging reforms will bring new impetus and vitality and make room for economic growth, Xi said.
The management group adopted a number of guides, including a negative list of market access regulation, easing customs control policies, encouraging state-owned enterprises to absorb private capital and reorganisation of the resident registration system.
According to the declaration, a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and areas of activity where investments are not allowed.
The system will be tested gradually and improved through test programs.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will give the market a more important role in allocating resources, providing a legislation-based business environment and providing a wider market opening.
State authorities will also weaken controls on the powers they delegate to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to run their businesses.
According to the declaration, China will also allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an attempt to open up state-controlled sectors, several sectors will be open to private investment.
"State authorities will not change their foreign investment policy and protect the legitimate interests of companies established from foreign investment and offer them better services," according to the statement.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign citizens to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called "green cards," optimising requirements and streamlining the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of lawyers' right of practice and the education of judges and prosecutors.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli attended the meeting, according to a statement made after the meeting.
Education unions, dissatisfied with the Government's proposal to raise salaries by 10%
Negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the leaders of the educational trade unions have not reached any results, with the Government proposing a 10% salary increase from 1 December, with payment on 1 January 2016, and the trade unions wanted a 15% increase in November or 20% increase in December.
The talks took place at Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, the prime minister being accompanied by Education Minister Sorin Cimpeanu, Finance Minister Eugen Teodorovich and Labour Minister Rovana Plumb.
Today's Government proposal did not please us, otherwise we would not have been in a position to convene the leadership of our federations.
The 10 percent we were promised today represents less to us than what we expected.
"In fact, these 10 percent is the money that we have stipulated in our agreement with the Government last year for 2016," said Anton Hadar, President Alma Mater, at the end of the talks.
Ponta: In future health and education will be the areas where we invest all the money we have
According to him, on Thursday, a meeting of the FSLI will be held with representatives of the Government to present to the confederations in the country the proposal for wage growth, following that the trade unionists will decide whether to accept the Executive's offer.
The prime minister also told trade unionists that the Government is trying to send the Salary Act as quickly as possible to Parliament, so that it can enter into force on December 1st.
The normative act provides for the increase of salaries in the educational system by 25% of the total increase of 70%, the increase provided for in the document to be carried out over the next four years.
Victor Ponta also promised trade unionists to pay the full amount of the 2016 court sentences.
Immigrant crisis: tragedy in the Aegean Sea
At least 22 immigrants drowned on Tuesday in Turkey's territorial waters, after the shipwreck they were in.
Among the victims were 11 women and 5 children, informing AFP, according to Yahoo News.
The boat was in the Aegean Sea and headed for the Greek island of Kos.
Turkey's coast guard said it was able to save 249 people who were in the shipwrecked boat, but their nationality is still unknown.
Previously, on Monday, two other people died while trying to cross the Aegean Sea.
Also, at the weekend, 34 immigrants, including 4 babies and 11 children, drowned off the Greek island of Farmakonisi, located 15 kilometers from the Turkish coast.
The situation was similar: the boat carried more people than its capacity, so it shipwrecked.

Over 100 stewardesses, fired because they were too fat.
Air India's airline fires about 130 stewards and stewardesses because they are overweight, announced the company at the end of last week.
The state company announced that the decision was made for security reasons and recent government regulations, but critics say the measure is "ridiculous" and "shocking of sexist," writes The Washington Post.
Mass dismissal is the most recent of a ten-year struggle between the company and the more full stewardesses.
The weight limit for these dates back to the '80s, when Air India began using charts with ideal weight and height.
In 2006, Air India fired the new stewardesses considered "exceptionally overweight," as this "can have an effect on reflexes and prevent the agility needed to perform emergency measures."
The stewardesses sued, won and were rehired, but the company fired them again in 2009.
"All efforts to make them lose weight have failed," then explains a spokesperson for the company.
A football player from Steaua teaches Gigi Becali: What a decision he made
A football player from Steaua is teaching Gigi Becali about promoting young players.
If the champion's financier decided to close the football academy in which he had invested a considerable amount, quarterback Paul Papp opened a football school.
The "Paul Papp" Academy will function in the town of Dej, the local kids being expected at a first selection action.
I am extremely happy to have come to this stage, to start the football academy that bears my name.
For me, it's extremely important that we find talented kids who can play football without worrying about materials in training.
They have to have one care: that of playing football as well.
The technical details don't have to be their concern.
They have to value their talent.
This thing wants to do the 'Paul Papp' Football Academy.
"I am also waiting for Mayor Costan Morar at the first selection of children, to show them that he is with them," said football player Papp for dejeanul.ro.
At the star quarterback's academy, children up to the age of 11 are expected.
The whole party wants to rule.
Acting PSD President Liviu Dragnea said on Tuesday that the whole party wants to remain in government, and if the prime minister wants to, this decision will be formalised at the PSD Congress.
I understand that Mr. Ponta is waiting for this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants to rule, the whole party.
If we want to formalize through a decision of Congress, we will also do this.
There won't be any emotion about that.
"There have been no elements, party voices, party opinions that give anyone uncertainty of government or that give someone the impression that someone in the party does not want the PSD to remain in government, in the current government, with the current prime minister," Dragnea said at the end of the meeting of the PSD National Permanent Bureau.
The PSD has announced when it will make its congress - what will be decided then
Prime Minister Victor Ponta said on Tuesday that it is important that, at the PSD Congress, beyond the election of leadership, a clear message be given whether it is intended to continue the government or whether the party decides to move into opposition.
Dragnea: I'll announce on Monday if I run for congress office
On the other hand, Liviu Dragnea will announce next Monday if he is to run for office in the future Congress.
I'll weigh, Monday, after the Executive Committee, if the congress's date is set.
"I will announce whether I will run for office in the party leadership," Dragnea said at the end of the PSD's Permanent National Bureau meeting on Tuesday.
Asked if the hesitation in announcing the candidacy had anything to do with his file, Dragnea said he didn't have that problem.
I don't have the problem you're referring to, but it seems fair and honest to all my colleagues in the party whether or not to announce a candidacy when the date of Congress is formally established.
"It's the only motivation," said Dragnea.
The vast majority of social-democratic subsidiaries proposed extraordinary PSD Congress on October 11th, and the exact date of Congress will be decided on Monday by the Party's Executive Committee.

How satisfied are the Romans in the couple: Men versus women
Most Romans are pleased with their relationships.
This is the conclusion of a study carried out on the occasion of John Gray's arrival in Romania, the famous author of the bestseller "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus."
A total of 62% of respondents declare themselves' very satisfied 'and' satisfied 'with the overall quality of the couple relationship.
"However, 18% show that they are 'slightly dissatisfied' and 'very dissatisfied' in the couple relationship, and another 18% declare 'appropriate'," is the conclusion of the study, as shown in a remitted communiquÃ©, Tuesday, Ziare.com. "
The situation is slightly different when the responses of men and women are analysed separately.
Thus, 28% of men are very satisfied, 39% satisfied, 17% suitable, 6% very unsatisfied and 8% slightly unsatisfied.
As far as women are concerned, 33% declared satisfied, 24% very satisfied, 8% very unsatisfied, 14% slightly dissatisfied and 19% chose the right catogria.
When we look at the degree of satisfaction (positive), we will see that men are more satisfied.
As far as the neutral state is concerned, we see a difference of two percent.
"Just as in the very unsatisfied situation, the biggest difference being recorded in the slightly unsatisfied response where we see a 6 percent difference," the communication also shows.
The study also showed that a quarter of the Romans (26%) spend an hour or even less time together, 18% spend between five and eight hours together, and 45% between two and four hours.
The students also report that "the Romans feel the need for some more adventure in their lives (24%), followed by affection (21%), money (21%), safety (20%), new (19%), sex (19%), 18% respect, 17% confidence, 17% pleasure, 17% connection, 16% knowledge, 14% protection, 14% importance, 12% learning, 11% freedom, 10% self-knowledge and 7% control."

Europe has once again been ashamed of itself
German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said on Tuesday that Europe "was disgraced" after Monday's failure at the Brussels ministerial meeting on the distribution of refugees within the European Union.

European Interior Ministers, meeting in Brussels for months of emergency, failed to reach an agreement on the mandatory distribution of 120,000 refugees, requested by the European Commission last week to deal with one of the worst migratory crises in Europe after 1945.

What's going on with Coach Darren Cahill?
Simona Halep is facing a crucial decision for her career, having to choose whether or not she will continue to work with Coach Darren Cahill.
The two worked this year as part of the Adidas Player Development program, the Australian technician being with the Romanian only on important tournaments.
Simona had only words of praise for Cahill, who seems to be the only coach who managed to impose himself on the capricious sport.
But the Adidas program will end at the end of this year, and Halep has to decide whether to offer a consistent contract to Cahill or give up his collaboration.
We don't know exactly what's going to happen yet.
We talk and see.
"After Singapore I will be able to give an answer," Simona confessed at a press conference.
Darren Cahill is one of the most expensive trainers in his current tennis, he's demanding a contract of about a million dollars a year.
In addition, the Australian is also a sports commentator, a profession he would not want to give up at the moment.
The last competition that Simona and Cahill will be working on together is the Champion Tournament in Singapore.
It wasn't normal, I wasn't respected.
Victor Piturca revealed how he broke up with Romania's national team last fall.
The former selectionist confessed that he did not get along with FRF President Razvan Burleanu, after he took Mircea Sandu's place, and thus made the decision to leave the country.
Eventually, he proposed to the head of the Federation to substantially raise his salary to stay, but he was refused.
Right now, I'm not sorry I left the nationals.
Then I'm sorry, we leave a job behind.
That's how I thought it was good for me then and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a selectionist, it wasn't normal, I wasn't respected, I wasn't respected.
I worked well with the people before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came up with a preconceived idea, he didn't know me, he learned different views from the press about me.
It didn't change me because it was very difficult at the time, with the results that I had, plus the financial situation was at stake.
We continued the work, everything went very well, and he probably changed his ideas, too.
But I wanted to leave.
If they really wanted me to stay, I offered them a contract raise.
We have about 400 and some thousand euros a year, I was going to have about 600 thousand euros.
I didn't talk to Burleanu, I spoke with his right hand.
"He agreed, but only if we finish first in the group," said Victor Piturca at Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from Romania's nationals last fall, although the team had good results in the Euro 2016 preliminaries.
The technician accepted the proposal to train in Saudi Arabia, he immediately took over Al Ittihad.
Blinds and water cannons at the border
The Hungarian police detached Humvee military vehicles equipped with machine guns at the border with Serbia, after the violent clashes during Wednesday, when water and tear gas guns were used against immigrants who wanted to enter from Serbia, despite Hungary lifting a barbed wire fence.
At least 20 cops and two kids were injured in clashes, writes Russia Today.
So far 20 cops have been injured and the ambulance service has taken over two children who have been injured after being thrown over the security fence.
"We will restore the fence and strengthen it and protect Hungary's security by any means necessary," Hungarian Prime Minister Gyorgy Bakondi said.
Police have tried to control with water cannons and tear gas the crowd of people who throw plastic bottles, stones and pieces of pavement.
Authorities reported that dozens of immigrants broke the fence at the crossroads between Roszke and Horgos and managed to break into the country.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto urged Serbia to take steps against "very aggressive" immigrants at the common border.
There are reports according to which Serbs and Serbs have supplemented their law enforcement at the border.
Following Wednesday's incidents, Budapest suspended the border crossing at Roszke-Horgos for 30 days.
Hungary is in a concerted action to close its borders to prevent immigrants from entering.
If on Tuesday he announced that in addition to the barbed wire fence at the border with Serbia he would also raise one at the border with Romania, towards the vehement protests of Bucharest, on Wednesday, the Hungarian prime minister announced the lifting of a fence at the border with Croatia.
The rare illness a man suffers from
The American Nick Hess was suspected by his family of being an alcoholic, his wife even filming him when he was dizzy, he could barely stand up and his words were hard to understand.
Although the 35-year-old said he didn't drink alcohol, it was visible that he was intoxicated.
When she first accused me of being drunk without drinking, I thought she was crazy.
"But friends and family believed 'maybe he drank on his own, he's a secret alcoholic'," he tells the story, according to Mirror.
When he saw his wife's footage of him, the man from Columbus, Ohio, he just didn't recognize himself, "I was looking into my eyes and I wasn't there."
'It was awful, I didn't remember anything. '
Besides, his wife, who, although she doubted him for a while, finally went with him to countless doctors, remembers that Nick's breath smelled like alcohol.
The moment that got Nick thinking the most was when, after a minor accident, when he was hit by another car, it was discovered that he had an alcohol level three times over his legal limit, although the night before, he had only consumed one beer.
After years and endless investigations, it was discovered that Nick suffers from an extremely rare disease, "Auto-brewery syndrome."
Basically, his body makes all the carbohydrates consumed ferment, turning into alcohol.
The one who suspected that this might be Nick's illness was even his wife.
The disease doesn't have a cure yet, but since it dropped carbs, Nick hasn't had one of these episodes.
He destroyed a Mercedes with a golf club.
A man from South Korea destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, in protest of the services he took part in by his dealer.
The man "attacked" his car with a golf club, causing enough damage for the car to be taken out of service, transmits BT.
The whole scene was filmed, and the video ended up on the Internet, to the amusement of the people who watched it.
The man claimed that the car has malfunctions that endanger his life and his family.
His anger came when the dealer he bought the car from didn't solve his problem, as they agreed.
The government approved, on Wednesday, the "National Immigration Strategy for 2015-2018" and the "Action Plan for the current year," documents considered to be "another stage Romania is taking as part of efforts to modernise the immigration management process on national territory," according to a press release.
The source cited shows that the strategy aims to manage immigration effectively, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and actions that reflect policies set at European level, adapted to national realities.
In view of the problems faced by the states in the immediate vicinity of Romania, measures are considered for the unitary and coherent management of situations determined by the possible emergence of an influx of illegal immigrants on Romanian territory, generated by situations of crisis of political, social, economic or military nature.
"The Romanian authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time will pay special attention to citizens from countries with migration potential or which can affect national security," the source added.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in Syria, reactivating the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in areas bordering Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and increasing the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document also sets out some general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, more rigorous controls of the legality of the residence of third-country nationals in Romania and the proper application of removal and restrictive measures, improving the national asylum system.
The national strategy also includes specific objectives relevant to the transposition and implementation of general strategic objectives.
These include: the facilitation of access to Romania by third-party citizens who respond to employment needs, the promotion of access of third-country nationals to higher education institutions in Romania for areas and professions identified as deficient.
Regarding the 2015 Action Plan, the Government considers that this represents "a means of establishing concrete activities leading to the creation of a flexible system for halting the growing migratory phenomenon."
Romania, in a European top on the labour market
Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria recorded the greatest increase in total labour costs among the Member States of the European Union in the second quarter of the year compared to the similar period in 2014, according to data published Wednesday by the European Statistical Office (Eurostat).
The index refers to employers' staff costs.
Thus, between April and June 2015, the total cost of labour increased by 1.9% in the European Union and 1.6% in the euro area.
Romania, third place in the EU to increase labour cost
The largest increases were reported in Latvia (7.9%), Romania (7.7%), Bulgaria (6.8%), Estonia (5.5%) and Lithuania (4.3%).
The only EU countries where the hourly cost of labour fell in the second quarter of this year were Greece (minus 2.9%), Cyprus (minus 1.2%) and Italy (minus 0.4%).
The advance of labour costs in Romania between April and June 2015 is mainly due to the increase of the hourly cost of labour in industry and services, by 7.9% and 7.6% respectively.
In the construction sector, Romania registered a 5.8% advance on the hourly cost of labour.
TVR management activity report rejected in committees: Stelian Tanase risks dismissal
Parliament's cultural commissions rejected on Wednesday the activity report of the Board of Directors of the Romanian Television Society for the year 2014.
17 MPs voted for rejection, one against rejection (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report will be forwarded to the Standing Offices together.
They'll probably decide next week.
The next meeting will be debated.
"I think that in view of this situation it will be done relatively quickly," said the President of the Senate Culture Commission, Georgica Severin.
He added that "it was common sense" for TVR's leadership to be present at this meeting, as no representatives of TVR's leadership were present at the meeting of the Cultural Commissions.
It was common sense to have TVR leadership present because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or anything like that.
The invitation was made to CA members as early as last night, with an approximate hour that we didn't know the time, but today, after the meeting of the Joint Offices, I personally sent a fax to the management of TVR inviting her.
I believe that the moment you're summoned, you're paid out of public fees, and you're summoned to a meeting of the reunited committees even if you don't like living.
"Because it is your duty to serve, you are in an institution under Parliament's command," Severin said after the meeting of Parliament's Commissions of Culture.
He added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed at the meeting on the basis of the negative opinion of the Budget Commissions.
The debts we saw as well as how they went on, came with the idea that this year they would have been up to date, but they didn't pay the historical ones.
"I remind you that it is not my fault or anyone else in these committees who has lost that pleasure with the banks and the tax, it is clear management issues," Severin said.
He added that once the activity report is rejected by the meeting plenary, elections will follow for a new Board of Directors, and he will elect the general director of the institution.
I don't know who will be proposed for this position.
Wonders won't be done.
The important thing is to make political decisions for this institution to work.
I'm not the man to lie to you, to tell you that you will appear a genius who will stand in line here and fight.
I hope that those who decide, the plenary of Parliament, by their vote, will choose with great reason the people who will lead TVR.
There must be people who know what's going on there, have experience and have a lot of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
I don't know who it's going to be, if you ask me what qualities it must have - common sense in the attitude towards employees because it's a malarkey of petitions coming from employees, complaints, layoffs.
"When you receive such referrals 50, 60, 70, something is rotten and we are talking about the financial situation that is a disaster," the president of the Senate Culture Commission concluded.
Although he did not come to Parliament, TVR CEO Stelian Tanase sent a letter to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, calling for Parliament to consider a series of measures that could save and guarantee the economic and political independence of public television, including the indexation of the TV tax.
In the letter, Stelian Tanase requested, in addition to indexing the TV tax, the modification and completion of HG 978 / 2003 on the fee for the public television service, in order to update the provisions at the level of up-to-date technological changes, as well as to regulate the procedure on control in the field of the payment of the TV tax and the finding of contraventions and the application of sanctions and penalties.
He also wants to issue a provision providing for the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become trustees of SRTv for the collection of the TV tax, by involving ANRE in the regulation of this activity.
In his view, it is necessary to set a maximum ceiling of 5% of the fee in cashing.
Stelian Tanase asks for the reduction of the VAT rate for the activities specific to the public television station and the contribution for CNC from 15% to the level of 3%, but also for the amendment of Law 41 / 1994, in the sense of the possibility of receiving budget allocations / financing for the acquisition of licences for major cultural and sporting events - World Cup, Golden Deer, Eurovision.
He claims that SRTv will be unable to pay in the coming months, given that the labour law obliges the employer to enforce the court decisions, even if they are not final, and the salary rights are honoured with priority over any other obligation.
The TVR administration has constantly made efforts to reduce staff costs and TV production.
"Thus, travel and other cost-generating activities were reduced, a number of commercial contracts were renegotiated, and at the end of July TVR News was closed," the TVR president's letter said.
Tanase considers that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied solely by its own efforts.
"Without the support of state institutions - Government, Parliament, President - Romanian Television will be unable, sooner or later, to carry out its public mission," it is mentioned in the letter.
The head of the House of Deputies has decided to send the letter to the Cultural Commission.
Vasile Blaga's son-in-law, brought to trial
Vasile Blaga's son-in-law, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, was sued on Wednesday by prosecutors of the Public Prosecutor's Office near the Bucharest Appeals Court.
He is charged with tax evasion, in a case of damage of approximately 600,000 euros, under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was preemptively arrested on May 22nd.
He founded the Axis Corporate Security SRL, with his mother in April 2009, one year after marrying Vasile Blaga's daughter Agathe.
The investigation revealed that, for the purpose of evading taxes and taxes to the state budget, representatives of a company specialising in security services would have created a criminal circuit, consisting of several companies, by which fictitious transactions would have been highlighted.
"In fact, fictitious purchases of services would have been registered in the company's accounts, which in reality were not provided, and the state budget was thus damaged by about 600,000 euros," Romanian Police explained in a press release.
The sheiks have established the fate of Sanmartean
The sheiks of the Al-Ittihad club established the fate of the middle Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press announces that Sanmartan's separation from Ittihad is imminent, Coach Ladislau Boloni's manager, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says this will never happen again.
Boloni is very pleased with Sanmartan.
Lucian plays match holder and makes it good.
The sheiks also realized that he's the best and that it would be wrong if they gave him up.
There would have been a way to bring in another player, much better, but nothing came of it.
"There have been several discussions, such as the one with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing has materialized," Zaporojanu said for Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad earlier this year.
Elijah Sarbu was voted vice president of the Court of Auditors
Parliament's plenary voted on Wednesday to appoint PSD Senator Elijah Sarbu, Prime Minister Victor Ponta's father-in-law, as Vice President of the Court of Auditors' Audit Authority.
According to Mediafax, 290 votes "for" and 108 "against" were registered.
The vote was secret, with IDs.
PNL representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, Digi24 informs.
In fact, the liberals criticised Sarbu's appointment in this position and announced that they would challenge her at the CCR, as he has a file at the DNA, but has no necessary training and experience.
Elijah Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new office at the Court of Auditors no longer allows him to make policy.
The PSD Senator will be the Vice President of the Court of Auditors' Audit Authority, left free after John Anton was revoked, following a decision of the Constitutional Court in September 2014, which found that he was appointed unconstitutional.

Asked what future plans he had at the time, Bradley Cooper said he was never the type of man to make five-year plans, "not even two."
"It's not at all motivating for me to have a map," he said.
"I have dreams, things that you would laugh about if I told you," he also said, saying that what he wanted from childhood came true.
At the age of 40, however, the actor admitted to seeing himself in the near future directing, taking the role model of Clint Eastwood, who also began directing at this age.
Ponta, accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational assertions
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto strongly condemned, on Wednesday morning, the statements of Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta according to which political decision makers in Hungary are "no better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees flee."
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost control of himself and, by his irrational assertions, offends the whole of Hungary," the Hungarian Foreign Minister said in a statement.
Civilized European politicians don't say such uncontrollable slander.
"His remarks have only one explanation: he has totally lost support in domestic politics in Romania," added the head of Hungarian diplomacy, according to MTI.
In a post Tuesday evening on Facebook, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wanted to attract attention and sanction the behaviour of senior Hungarian government officials, who in his opinion "are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union."
I do not wish to respond to challenges from Hungarian government representatives.
"They are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union; and to anti-Semitic attitudes, and to the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis!," Ponta said on Facebook.
The Romanian Prime Minister added that he is adept at rational and sustainable solutions in the event of the refugee crisis, considering that brutalities and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Barbed sarma, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are no better policy makers than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which those refugees flee!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions, and especially in the superiority of European values - what we see in the last few days in Hungary is in total contradiction precisely with these goals and values!," the head of the Roman executive stressed.
Earlier on Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto described as "mere lies" the remarks of Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta regarding Hungary's management of the refugee crisis, considering that these claims are inappropriate for a 21st century leader, according to the MTI.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy also mentioned on Tuesday that the "extremist and lying remarks" of the Romanian Prime Minister are related to the domestic political crisis in Romania and stated that Budapest expects an apology from the Romanian side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I have always said and said is that I am against xenophobic speeches and the idea of closing the borders, that all those who come are terrorists, are nonsense of the Middle Ages, and I am totally opposed to this approach.
If we can get more, we'll get more, the problem is our logistical ability to treat those people like people, not the way our Hungarian neighbours treat them, with the bat and the scaling.
"I disagree with that," the head of the Roman executive said at a press conference in Targu-Jiu.
Also on Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Budapest Government has decided to start preparations in the field for the extension of the border with Romania to the fence it is building at the border with Serbia, in order to cope with a possible change of route used by migrants.
Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta stated that Hungary's decision to build a border fence does not solve anything of the refugee problem and "takes Hungary out of Europe."
What a connection between Osama bin Laden and the collapse of the Mecca crane
The Saudi authorities have announced that the Saudi giant Binladin Group, belonging to Osama bin Laden's family, is "partially responsible" for the collapse of a crane on Friday, on the Great Mosque at Mecca, an accident which resulted in 107 people dying.
According to an investigation committee, the company did not "comply with safety standards," the Saudi press agency (SPA) reported, the BBC reports.
Company executives were banned from leaving the country until the investigation was completed in this case.
The company will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction firm is owned by the family of former terrorist leader Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father 80 years ago and is currently run by the brother of former terrorist leader Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for 4 years on the expansion of the Great Mosque, so that we can host more pilgrims.
The accident occurred on Friday night during a storm, when a crane, probably unbalanced by strong winds, collapsed on the eastern side of the Mecca Mosque Sea roof.
Following the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How Haji closed the mouth of the deniers
Considered by many people the greatest Romanian footballer in history, Gica Hagi has been labeled after his retirement as a weak coach who cannot be able to perform in the new position.
After unfortunate experiences with the national team, Star or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, a year ago, the role of coach at the future of Constanta, the team he patrols.
After exactly one year of taking over the team, the King has shown that he is able to turn a team that was struggling to save from demarcation into a top one.
Thus, after a year, the future recorded, with Haji coach, 16 wins, 11 draw and 11 defeats.
The balance sheet is one of a top team that fights at European Cups.
Things have taken an even better turn for the future this season, as the team reached second place in League 1, with 19 points, one less than the leader of Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (tied with Astra), more than double the Star.
On the other hand, even though he brought more experienced players to the team, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and recently on the starting team there were names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea.
The club's policy made the Future a team to follow for teams from abroad, so Hagi sold this summer of 1.5 million euros - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
Along with Star, the future is the only profitable team in League 1, according to data from the Trade Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has so far played as a small country.
It's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated like the seventh country of the EU.
Large countries come up with solutions for the EU as a whole, said Cristian Ghinea, a member of the Romanian Centre for European Policy's executive college.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Gaina showed that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and pure police means will not work in this crisis: "Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come with."
But there are masses that have started and we can't turn history around.
Migration is a reality that we need to adapt to as well as possible and adapt them to ourselves.
In Cristian Ghinea's opinion, we are at an extremely emotional time, when politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After he passes, Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created in another era that was not adapted to the situation now."
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JHA council that actually didn't solve anything?
It is clear that the EC president in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote on the council.
All the predictions said he had the votes.
Before the Treaty of Lisbon, the principle of unanimity was applied in JHA and any state could block any decision.
That is why things have been very little integrated into justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure applies, in which the EC has the initiative, and the council approves it with the vote of 55% of the states, i.e. 16, representing 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said the votes existed.
But they didn't want to go forward.
Because it's a sensitive issue, rejection reactions have occurred in Germany itself against Chancellor Merkel's opening policy and did not want to appear in many countries as a "EU sends us migrants on our heads."
They have therefore postponed, but the problem remains because, obviously, this wave creates a huge problem for the Schengen governess and we will probably see big changes there in the coming period.
So the mandatory quotas weren't really eliminated, but the subject was just allowed to cool off?
Yes, on the other hand, there is talk of a greater involvement of Frontex in the management of the external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of the members who are at the Schengen border to the responsibility of the Community agencies.
The Greek border with Turkey is also the German border with Turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants has given the limits of the old Schengen system.
Perhaps the Dublin principle will be waived, according to which migrants are the responsibility of the state in which they first enter, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece is boning, you can't say it's Greece's business forever.
The problem is common.
Just because the problem is common, is a solution possible without a precise mechanism, perhaps even mandatory, to divide the effort of receiving it?
No one knows exactly how the mandatory odds will work if it comes to them.
Because it remains a problem: what do you do with a man who doesn't want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don't think European states are going to take up migrants: you go to the country X or the country Y.
There will probably be some unique filtration centres, in Greece or in Turkey, where asylum applications will be processed.
They're working on solutions like this.
But the problem doesn't have a simple solution.
They are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, are countries with no experience, like Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase xenophobic current.
It is a fact that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, who are staying in precarious camps and who have just begun to leave for Europe.
An estimate says that only 10% got away, winter is hard to get past the Mediterranean, but we expect a wave next year, maybe even higher.
What do we do with these people?
My prognosis is that we'll get used to this problem, not look at it so profoundly from a media point of view.
You were talking about countries with less or greater experience.
Does it seem to you that there is a place where he has really succeeded in integrating large groups from an extra-European culture?
I look at the Magrebians in France, the Turks in Germany, they're still enclaved.
I wouldn't go to radical statements.
Of course their integration is more difficult than with other waves of migration, but that doesn't mean they don't fit in at all.
It has remained an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, in Germany, in the UK.
But pure police means won't work.
Creating the fortress of Europe is illusory.
The mechanisms for integration into European societies must be dealt with.
There have been some mistakes here.
We need to be more picky.
Let us ask these people to learn the language, to try to take over the values, not to stay with one foot in Europe and one foot in their country of origin, bringing the rest of their family including through marriages of convenience.
But the impending problem of these people must be separated from the long-term problem of their integration.
Just because others have failed in long-term integration doesn't mean we have to watch them drown in the Mediterranean.
Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come up with.
And just because there's going to be an intervention in Syria, which I don't think, doesn't mean the country's going to recover overnight and you can take them back.
Before solutions appear, we see fortresses within Europe.
Borders closed, walls erected, border controls reintroduced in the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project as such does not, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimally and setting the rules so the pressure was too high on the countries where they first set foot these migrants.
I mean, we've been walking around free, but each one's got his own problems.
In front of a wave like this, it can't be like this, because some countries can't handle it.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to look like they're doing something, but in the long run, it doesn't change much.
After the attacks in France, we don't have much more evil anti-terrorist legislation in the EU than we did last year.
It's a wave of public emotion that sets in both directions.
And it's so unstable from week to week that you can't make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of belligerent statements from politicians at home under pressure to be virile.
And then you have the dramatic case of the drowned child in Turkey and the public opinion gets nervous.
After the public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for humans, but also for goods.
This is the single European real market.
And I don't think Europeans will give up this principle of freedom of movement.
That there will be other rules is different.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era that was not adapted to the current situation.
How has Romania played so far in this crisis?
Like a small country, which believes that if it pulls the cap over its eyes and closes its ears, the theme disappears.
In the face of the reality of migrant waves, you can choose to be part of the solution or say it's not your small country problem.
That's what we did, it's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated like the seventh country of the EU.
You're not, you're not playing big country.
Large countries come up with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we are not discussing their quality now.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the Romanian appetite for Schengen will fall greatly.
President Iohannis says maybe it's a good thing we're not in yet.
So we go from despair of entry to a more pragmatic position, but the objective remains.
There is, of course, a risk that Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen so that migrants can see us as the alternative route.
Which doesn't mean there's a reason we should stop going to Schengen, but be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but turned into a shared responsibility for external borders, there will be unique rules for accepting migrants, unique rules for deportation for those who do not receive asylum, unique rules for countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia moved its attention to Syria in Ukraine no one else died.
Is there a connection between the two outbreaks, a Russian game?
Russia has a frustrated behavior of power.
She believes that being a great power means messing with the Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the military and financial effort of the Putin regime, the Assad regime would have collapsed long ago.
And it was good to crash before its main opponent was the Islamic State.
A few years ago, there was a struggle between the Assad regime and moderate secular and Muslim militias, supported by the Gulf countries and the Westerners.
Then the Islamic State got up, and now we don't know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia has been able to complicate things, but it cannot participate in the solution.
It creates outbreaks of instability and chaos that you cannot close.
But you're only great power if you have solutions.
The game off-side is just a strategy to buy time.
Putin's probably waiting for offers to be made, so he can push the buttons to fix it.
Offers don't come because people aren't convinced that he can solve issues that he created in one way or another.
But I don't agree with theories that say these people are being driven by an invisible hand.
Let's not see a little more powerful than he is.
What a button will appear soon
Millions of Facebook users have gotten used to the "Like" button, and now social network representatives are preparing the opposite, the "Dislike" button.
Marti, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and CEO of the company, announced on his account that this button will be available soon, informs the New York Times on the blog.
Zuckerberg stated that the "Dislike" button would show a nuance of what a user feels rather than simply an option.
However, his announcement raised the question that Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg has mentioned that he wants to avoid the moments when someone posts on his account an important event in his life, and someone else will give "Dislike."
Network users, who have reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long called for the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg also said that it is not very comfortable for people to give "Like" to current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the event of a family member's death.
"You may not feel comfortable giving Like to that post," the Facebook representative scored.
The version of a new Facebook button was not welcomed well by everyone.
"There was already enough hate on Facebook and social media," Atiq Haneef from Afghanistan commented on the New York Times Facebook page, where the article was posted on the subject.
"I'll give 'Dislike' to the 'Dislike' button," he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist in Atlanta, claimed there was nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, social media analyst at the eMarketing company, mentioned that it is hard to imagine that a single button can transmit a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she claims, the election campaign is coming up in America, and the Dislike button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary within 24 hours
Hungary accepted only 70 migrants on Tuesday, a handful of thousands coming to mass on its southern border with Serbia, government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi announced.
Hungary declared a state of emergency during the day in two counties along the border with Serbia due to the flow of refugees, closing a main border crossing point and announcing that it would build a fence at its border with Romania, the DPA recalls.
The measure attracted a sudden reaction from Serbia.
Just yesterday they said they would seal the border for those who want to pass, but not for those who want to seek asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different," Serbian Refugee Minister Aleksandar Vulin said.
Prior to imposing the new immigration legislation, a record 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, police announced on Monday.
Also, more than 170,000 immigrants from the Middle East and Africa entered Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and try to reach the West, especially Germany.
The "new" county council headquarters are about to fail.
Two manufacturers, in insolvency
The massive investments made here in recent years, in order to move the institution, are falling apart because they have been stopped several times.
Two major builders who worked here went into insolvency during the work.
The county council headquarters in Vasile Alecsandri Street will end up tearing itself down.
A year and a half after the construction of the building had to be completed, the building had not been halved.
One last step in the building's epoch was consumed the other day, when the National Council for the Resolution of Contestations (CNSC) rejected a complaint by the company that wanted to take over the contract for the technical project for the works to be carried out.
The original project was prepared by Impex Romcatel SA.
Following the insolvency of the manufacturer and the interruption of the works, the negotiation procedures were started without publication of a contract notice with Impex Romcatel, with the company to update the technical project and then hold a new tender for the works.
"However, negotiations were not concluded through a contract, with CJ considering that the proposed form would have put the institution at a disadvantage," RÄzvan Timofciuc, represented public relations within the CJ.
The CJ decision to discontinue the direct negotiations was challenged by Impex Romcatel in court.
The Court of First Instance sent the complaint to the CNSC, which rejected it as late.
However, this does not mean that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to attack the CNSC's decision at the Court of Appeal, only after a final sentence can it be considered to find another designer.
Thus, building consolidation could be resumed at the earliest next year.
Our intention is to restart work as soon as possible.
In principle, the restoration of the technical project should not take long, but we must come to the conclusion of a contract.
"We are waiting to see whether the CNSC decision will be attacked or not," Timofciuc said.
The consolidation of the former headquarters of the Police Department began in 2011.
A first works contract was terminated in April 2012, after works of MDL 4.5 million had been performed.
The tender was resumed and the contract was awarded by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the company went into insolvency, and this contract was terminated, after payments of MDL 1.5 million had been made.
The work has so far been done at about 50%.
Initially, the building's consolidation, refunctionality and endowment works had been valued at 7.7 million lei.
"All right, I'll tell you everything!" - the statement that could incriminate the former head of Cadastre
One of the employees involved in the scandalous file at the Cadastre Office signed an agreement recognising the facts, against imprisonment with delay.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the other defendants, headed by former chief Narciza Nedelcu
An adviser from the Office of Cadastre and Real Estate Advertising (CPVI) was accused by the DNA in a corruption case.
The agreement on the recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru DascÄlu was registered yesterday at the IaÅi Court, with judges setting out to give a solution in this case on 29 September.
Dumitru Daniel Dascalu was charged with continued intellectual forgery and agreed to perform two years of postponement, as well as community service.
As regards the facts attributable to Dascalu, the prosecutors stated that he, as an adviser to the Cadastre Office, together with other colleagues, "falsely drew up several minutes of acceptance, following the contracts for the provision of services previously called by the O.C.P.I. IaÈi with the directors of SC Gauss SRL, SC Grup Five SRL, SC Topo Euro Cad SRL, SC Ca Daster and Topografie SRL and PFA LipÈa Åtefan, who unrealistically attested that the contracted services were carried out in full, provided that they were not performed and deposited with the O.I. I."
The other day, former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, as well as other former or current employees of the CPVI, were sued in this case, with charges being the settlement of services to those firms, although the works were not carried out.
The judiciary exceeds 300,000 lei.
Adventures in the Stone Age
According to FRH President Alexandru Dedu, Romania can only host a major handball competition in 2024, and the preparation of the female handball national for the Olympic Games qualification costs a fortune.
The President of the Romanian Federation of Handball, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday at a meeting with the press that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
With regard to Romania's national women's handball team, "the main goal is to qualify for the Rio Olympics, but for that it has to pass two stages of caudine pitchforks, primarily the World Championship and secondly the pre-qualification tournament," Dedu said.
We really want to qualify for the Olympics.
There are some fantastic requirements from the technical staff run by Tomas Ryde.
Staf that will be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants second coach, doctor, two masseurs, doorman coach, physical trainer, head of delegation.
They asked us to get the qualification some things, specifically materials for physical training, which we've never heard of.
All this to get to the Olympic Games and I'll do whatever it takes to have them.
We're talking about a massive investment, there's a lot, a lot of money.
But this is the way to do performance.
Because right now we're in the Stone Age with the preparation.
"The teams with which we are fighting have these materials and have them for some time," said Dedu, who noted that he was trying to obtain the necessary amounts for the purchase of these products from MTS and COSR.
President FRH also referred to infrastructure in Romania and the possibility for our country to host a major handball competition.
We don't have a gym in Bucharest.
It is an infrastructure issue and it is shameful to question a European gymnastics championship.
Let us not forget that in other parts of the world, Olympic neighborhoods have been built entirely within two years.
Before 1992, in the present Olympic area of Barcelona there was a landfill, and now it has become a landmark of beauty.
The same happened in London, where the organisation of the 2012 Olympics was also a success in terms of investment.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition," Dedu said.
He added that international handball bodies are willing to give Romania a major competition.
It is a priority for me to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Gatu went civilised with a project, people gave their consent in principle, but they made it very clear very quickly that the hall would never be built.
And I had discussions with the EHF, I told them that we wanted to, that we were able to organize, and they said that we would agree and invite them to the first game in the new hall in Bucharest, and then we would talk about it in concrete terms.
"So we have the whole opening, both at the EHF and at the IHF, but we have no infrastructure," the FRH official explained.
The former great handbalist avoided assessing the chances of the female teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach the Final Four: "I have asked all coaches to be booked into predictions, that if they do not come true they turn against them."
Have a safe trip to the World Cup.
Romanian Rugbyists debut on September 23 against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said on Tuesday at a press conference that all components of the Romanian lot are ready for the World Cup matches in England, where he hopes to win two victories: "We are ready."
Both my colleagues and I are on full-speed engines.
We trained to give the best performance in the four games.
Everyone will have high expectations, because our goal is to win in two matches, against Canada and Italy.
All the groups are heavy and ours is the same.
Let's take it easy, first with France and then we'll see.
But surely, if we win with Canada, the match with Italy will be our final.
I cannot describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup is the crowning of so many years of work.
I wish I didn't disappoint anyone in the rugby family and come up with nice results at home.
"We want you to be proud that some players, a small family such as rugby in Romania, are proud to represent the tricolor," Macovei said.
Romania's national team, Lynn Howells, who was first experienced as a World Cup coach, hopes to make Romanians proud of rugby selection: "It is a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup."
I'm sure the players are ready to participate in the tournament.
This is an extraordinary experience for me.
It is very important for me that every game I play makes Romanians proud of the national team.
The President of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitras, trusts that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in the last few years in rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made on the national team.
I wish the athletes success and I am convinced that we will be at the height of the event.
"These boys started playing in Romania's teams at the age of 18-19, so there's cohesion, there's a band of friends, who set themselves up to realize a dream," Dumitras said.
At the World Rugby Cup in England, Romania will evolve to Group D with the following scheduled matches: with France on 23 September in London; with Ireland on 27 September in London; with Canada on 6 October in Leicester; with Italy on 11 October in Exeter.
The competition starts on Friday, at the Twickenham Stadium in London, with England-Fiji group A
New Japanese culture courses organized at the University of "Al.I. Cuza"
About the arrangement of flowers in a vase, the painting in the ink, but also an easy study about the beautiful arts specific to the Land of the Rising Sun you can learn at the courses organized by the students in the country.
The Japanese Culture Students' Circle in IaÈi organizes new courses of Japanese culture (ikebana, Sumie and Fine Arts) between October 2015 and June 2016, courses for both beginners and trained persons.

"Interested persons will be able to learn how to achieve harmonious floral sculptural creations (ikebana), how to capture the soul of the surrounding elements in plastic compositions using the Japanese art of painting in tush (Sumie) or how to express their own individuality and creativity through the multirivaled universe of beautiful arts (graphic, drawing, painting)," said Sorin Mazilu, teacher of these courses.
The courses are aimed at all those who are passionate about art, regardless of age or experience.
Registrations shall take place until 30 September, and those who wish to ask for more information may do so at the telephone number: 0742.027.153 or at the e-mail address: studenticulture @ gmail.com.
14 million lei given to St. Spiridon Hospital in Iasi at budget rectification
What will be purchased with this large amount of money?
St. Spiridon Hospital received approximately 14 million lei from the Ministry of Health, following the budget adjustment.
The money that the medical unit received to use it by the end of the year will be invested in the modernisation and development of clinics, but also in medical equipment and techniques for which the hospital has already started the procurement procedure.
Thus, the health unit will be equipped with a new tomography computer, with a new radiology apparatus, with six surgical kits, six suitably equipped ICU beds, an ophthalmological microscope and other apparatus necessary to perform the medical act.
On the other hand, 5 million lei of the money received by the hospital will be directed to the construction and arrangement of the "Great Burn."
Of the money from the budget adjustment, UPU will receive 500,000 lei for the completion of the modernization works in the main section.
"In addition, the following days we will receive work from the bridge connecting the UPU to the clinics of cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology to ensure the decent transport of the patient from the UPU to the neighbouring clinics," the medical unit manager explained.
The hospital will soon have in the courtyard and the Dermatology Clinic in TaraÈi, which it will organize in the outpatient, in the same form as it currently operates.
The clinic will operate in the area of allergology, hematology and outpatient endocrinology and will have about 30 beds.
The coward, made a fool of by the RATP controllers and a flyer.
A tourist's crib
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iasi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After my experience neither I nor my wife want to step in your town again.
Unwittingly, they hit the wrong information in the leaflets, the insensitivity of the RALT controllers, and, bonus, a fine "that is what the law says."
The husbands arrived in Iasi a few days ago, checked into a hotel in the Centre and asked for tourist leaflets.
They also received a flyer in which the RATP routes were crossed.
Armed with these maps, the husbands visited Iasi.
But two days ago, in the Copou, they wanted to get to the Palas Mall.
Because there was no ticket truck in the station near Copou Park, they relied on the information printed on the flyer: they can take a ticket by SMS.
No one told them this service no longer exists.
Confidence in the flyer, they got on a bus and tried to send SMS after the instructions on the flyer.
Unfortunately for them, a team of RATP controllers has emerged.
They said there hadn't been a service for two years, and they announced in the press that it had been cancelled.
How do I know what was written in the local press, me coming in the night before I visited town?
I talked to the controllers, explained the situation, they said they didn't care, it's none of their business.
The attitude was very defiant.
They said all they can do is give us one fine instead of two (me and my wife).
"I paid, I didn't want to ruin my visiting day by sitting at the gendarmerie and making statements there!," Ovidiu tells.
In conclusion, the family was fined because of the erroneous information on the flyer and the controllers who "applied the law to blood."
It's not fair, and I made a referral to RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about the money, it's not too much, but the point is, I felt cheated.
Bad luck for the rapists in Vaslui.
They had an accident and remained in remand.
The trial of the seven rapists at Vaslui has since moved to the IaÈi Court of Appeal since yesterday.
The local magistrates tried their first trial in a non-public session, in which the seven young accused of mocking an 18-year-old woman asked to be set free.
Prior to the actual commencement of the hearing, one of the foreign judges to whom the file had been assigned, Viorel Munteanu made an application for absolution, which was accepted by his colleagues from the court.
The magistrate served until the summer of this year at the Vaslui Court, where he was the president of the PÄnale Section, who, on 9 April, admitted an appeal by four of the defendants, having them placed under house arrest.
The file is currently being tried by a full-fledged magistrate Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Previously, in the file, he made an abstention and Judge Dan An ton, on the grounds that his daughter was in a relationship of conciliation with one of the rapists' lawyers.
The two judges decided that the rapists of Vaslui should remain in custody.
Ti neri will remain incarcerated for at least another 30 days, when the players will rediscuss the possibility of putting them on the loose.
The next trial will be held at the IaÈi Court of Appeal on 6 October.
Before arriving at the IaÈi Court of Appeal, the van with which the rapists were transported from Vaslui was involved in an accident in the PÄcurari district, the car entering Iasi on the belt.
The Iveco car with which the seven rapists were transported hit a Volks wagen car that had left the street of Canta, and the driver tried to turn left.
The van is running from the end of the Grains.
The car entered IaÅi through here because the employees of the Penitentiary Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to IaÈi through the Stables, then on the belt road.
They thus shortened the road by a few kilometers.
Immediately after the impact, the escort of the arrests called for another shipment to take over the detainees.
In a short time, a car was sent to the scene of the accident from the IaÈi Maximum Safety Penitentiary, which took over the seven detainees and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
Following the accident, none of the arrested were injured.
To transfer them to the other van, the guards surrounded the back of the masses, and the arrests went out in speed, two by two.
"The incident has not been reported to the police, as drivers of vehicles have agreed amicably on the damage to be paid," said Chief Commissioner MÄdÄlin ÈÄranu of IPJ.
Large migrations
Romania is not, nor will it be, prepared for what is to come.
What about Europe?
I say this from the beginning, clear and clear: the seven thousand refugees that Romania should and should naturalise are, in itself, an insignificant but huge number compared to the capacity of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, in the amount of about 1500 souls, goes far beyond our good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Surely, if those migrants really agree to settle in our localities, the chances of rapidly integrating them into Romanian society are extraordinarily low.
I'm sure they'll be the first to lose patience.
Parasitted by interlops and paralyzed by a venal political class, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.
The inability to integrate gypsies is just a trivial example.
In addition, governments of every color have not been able to absorb European funds, to make roads, kindergartens or modern schools, to provide decent healthcare, to collect dirt on the street, to create honorably paid jobs or to keep their own young generation at home.
Why would refugees settle in another country from which they are fleeing?
But what makes a lot of wonder is, in particular, the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is being dealt with.
We are first faced with the belicious hypocrisy of the powerful EU states, which show the greatest generosity when it comes to sharing troubles with smaller countries.
Then comes the fearful hypocrisy of Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, do not yet accept the other - another language, another religion, another blood.
Probably for fear of anyone stealing his national being.
After all, there is also a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, while invoking only the horrors of war as a reason for departure, accept no other destination of exodus than Germany or the Nordic countries.
However, not all refugees are Syrians, and there is no war in Pakistan.
Also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analysed can only be taken lightly.
The causes must be eliminated, some argue and, depending strictly on the political correctness book, call for peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
But there is peace in Romania and it even comes in, from time to time, some foreign capital in the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why are they leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union was revealed to us as an ankylosing, divided and obsolete construction.
I depended on the fact that Romania is unable to invent a country project, but here even the EU does not have any future plans.
And improvisation and threats don't help.
Then, what use is the EU, if the only advantage that Romanians enjoyed - the right to free movement - could be called into question because of the waves of refugees crossing the borders like cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will be over.
Not the migrant crisis, though.
Over the next decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc., will push millions of desperate migrants from Asia and especially Africa to a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and will never be ready for what will come next.

Two brothers from Tomesti swallowed sleeping pills.
They were taken to the hospital
Two 9-year-olds and 11-year-olds from Tomesti, brothers, swallowed several Diazepam pills.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother was on medication, and the drugs weren't hidden.
The children were rushed to St. Mary's Hospital in Iasi.
They're stable, as the doctors say.
A meeting that breaks your heart.
At 20 he received a brave gift: biological parents
Lost in the hospital in unclear conditions, in the gloom of the '90s, when she had only two months of life, little, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family in Italy, in the same years when the adoption was vaguely regulated, a young Jewish girl, now a blonde and beautiful girl, reunited the day before yesterday in Iasi with the biological parents from a county village, after almost two decades in which no one knew anything about the others.
Crina will be 20 years old these days, and her adoptive parents in Palermo have thought of giving their beloved daughter an amazing and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, to Iasi, to know her unclear past.
"The newspaper of IaÈi," which witnessed the search for the family of origin after some very vague clues, witnessed these meetings that basically break your heart.
The story of reporters, the emotions of the moment, the statements of those involved, their reactions are really moving and overwhelming.
The story of Crina began 20 years ago in the town of Rusty, when she was only two months old.
Then, due to a health problem, the girl had to be admitted to the hospital, to the city.
At home there began to be misunderstandings between parents, and mother had to leave her home.
He decided to keep the girl, and he decided to send me away.
He stopped the girl, and I haven't known anything since.
"When I found out he was in the hospital, it was too late," Alina, the girl's biological mother, remembers grieving.
Crina was admitted with her grandmother to the municipal hospital in PaÅcani, and then the girl's father, Costie Balcan, went to work in Alexandria, Teleorman County.
Their lives were going to break up forever.
They couldn't find Crina at the hospital.
After admission, Crina's father went to work in another village, and returned six months later.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iasi, and the father, when he returned, never found her.
I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"He must have thought it was abandoned," tells a family niece.
Because of the financial problems, Grandma couldn't bring Crina to IaÅi, and the girl remained in the care of doctors.
Because no one else cared about the fate of the child during this time, it was taken over by the General Directorate of Social Assistance and Child Protection IaÈi, who then gave it to the Placement Centre in Bucium for care.
There were years when abandonment and adoption were more easily regulated than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center she was found by Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but failed.
They fell in love with the blonde Crina on the spot, and after some time she was going to move with them to Italy.
The little girl had already done almost two years, while the adoption formalities lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt she was our girl.
"As if my wife had given her life," he tells us smiling Salvadore, the adoptive father, while catching the girl's scrawny hand in the palm of his hand.
In the country, Crina's parents, Alina and Costica, continued the search separately, each where they could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginoasa, but received no answer where his child might be.
The police then told her that she might be deceased, but in IaÅi the parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I looked for her here, they told me at the courthouse she was going to Italy to Palermo.
And the conditions to look for her were gone.
We prayed to God for good.
I thought about it all the years that went by, but there was no way to walk, to find it.
"It's hard," he tells us with tears in his eyes the birth mother of Lina.
But even though the years have passed, the parents of Ruginoasa have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and his wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past ties her to Romania.
I was a little girl when I found out.
I guess I was five or six years old.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to meet my parents in Romania," says Crina delighted.
And her dream was going to come true.
In March of this year, Chief Commissioner Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Drug Advisor IaÈi, was contacted by an acquaintance from Italy who explained to Salvadore the desire to find Crina's biological family.
And the search only came from a name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started our first steps.
I only got one name, Balkan Costice, then the town, Rusty.
Shortly after I had an activity with the city there, and I was able to ask if there was a name in the village.
That's when they gave me some indication, except the person they found wasn't the one they were looking for.
"It took about a month before we found the girl's biological father," Prime Commissioner Ichim explains.
In total, it took more than three months for the authorities to find Costica and Alina, especially since each of them was domiciled in another locality.
We started work somewhere in March, and in June-July we completed the identification of biological parents and discussions.
"That's when we agreed that a first meeting would take place in September," Romica Ichim added.
On the past weekend, Alina and Costica first saw their lost daughter in the halls of the hospital in Iasi 20 years ago.
The father, excited, could barely control his tears, and his hands trembled forever.
He barely talks to anyone around here.
A week before the meeting, he couldn't even sleep.
He was all excited, shaking.
"To see your child after all these years, there is something," a niece tells us, also coming with Costice from the Rusty.
Crina's meeting with mother and biological brother
In talks with his daughter, who is about to study at a well-rated university in Italy, Costica Balcan told him, among other things, that if she ever wanted to go back to him in the village, she could come to him quietly: she could give him some sheep, goats, so she could find a boy from the village and hook up a household.
My mom's nervous, she's crying, and she hardly thinks anything like this can happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I never thought anything like this could happen.
I've seen cases like this on TV, I've been thinking these years, I've been hoping, but I didn't think I could be like that.
They're very emotional.
If only he could forgive me.
I hope we can visit in the future.
"I hope we can keep a bond," tells us with great tears on Alina's cheeks, Crina's mother, while holding a napkin tight.
In him she hides her tears, with happiness, because soon she will see her face after such a bitter time.
On the other side, Crina, who will only be in a few days, this month, 20 years, is trying to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn't know what to expect, but she sketched a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they're young, but now before the meeting he's trying to gather his thoughts, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to blame.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are the ones who raised me after all.
It'll be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope to have a nice memory of them, because now there's so much to say," Crina tells us.
First Family Meeting in Iasi
In Unirii Square, under the autumn sky, the family of Ruginoasa reunite their destiny with their daughter of Palermo.
Crina is now 20 years old, finishing high school, based on the Italian school model, but she can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
I no longer divide borders or countries, but just a barrier: that of the language.
Over which, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in the center of Iasi, passed easily.
Those who managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first event of its kind, and that, in the future, if the opportunity arises, they will.
It's the first event of its kind organized, of such an emotional charge, and I'm glad to be a success.
We, at the Centre, have different activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution that deals only with people who are using, people who are addicted to drugs.
But we're trying to give societies something good back.
"If I am ever required for such an eneniment, I will do so with great affection," says Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Drug Advisor IaÈi.
Behind him, the Balcan family, with the Crina in the middle, are walking away telling stories.
Understandable: they have a lot to say to each other.
Armistice with guns at his feet yesterday at the PSD.
Everybody takes their breath
The camps in the Iesha branch of the PSD ended a truce with a gun to the foot.
After successive rounds of talks, held from Friday to Sunday, the first being and most tense, PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Pressured by the party's executive president, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the local Social Democrats will send him a full list of potential candidates for party positions.
Far from over, the internal war in the party seems to have taken just a break to allow the combatants to catch their breath.
Dragnea didn't give an ultimatum.
It has released a very simple and very current message under the current conditions: try to find a solution to not endanger the party.
On October 3rd, we have an election in the party.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," said the interim mayor, Mihai Chirica.
The two days of discussions at the weekend only led to the conclusion that nothing was established.
In the October elections, fierce competition is expected for the president of the PSD county branch.
On the short list of possible candidates for the main office of the party's Jewish branch are Secretary of State Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin LazÄr, county councilor Vasile CÃ¢tea and interim President of the County Council Victorel Lupu.
The mayor of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache, could also be added to them.
One variant considered is the candidacy of PSD county councillors, Cristian Stanciu, if Lupu will no longer join the race, with sources from the party claiming that he is not interested in the position.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is that of the former branch leader, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, including on election day, applications can be submitted, and it would not surprise anyone if they did.
"The important thing is that we remain united, and we will stay after 3 October, when we have a new Executive Office, a new County Permanent Office and all new management structures," CÃ¢tea said.
Until internal elections are held, the head of the PSD county branch will be provided by Victorel Lupu, a close to Nichita and Stanciu.
Lupu, however, is on leave until 29 September, with the preparation of elections to be provided by the executive secretary of the branch, county councilor Mikhail Popescu, in cold relations with the Nichita camp.
Contact by telephone, Cristian Stanciu appreciated the discussions of the last few days as leading to "a partial consensus."
There is a wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
A partial consensus was reached to support a unit team to deal with the county.
"However, on the other hand, there are several options regarding the intentions of running for the PSD Presidency IaÈi, with the list remaining open," Stanciu commented.
A Jewish judge turned down Vaslui's rape case on the grounds of conciliation
The seven young men in Vaslui county convicted of rape arrive today at the IaÈi Court of Appeal.
The Vasluians sentenced to punishment between five years and eight months and eight years and four months will present today their arguments on their release, after the court, Vaslui Court, established their imprisonment immediately after the sentence was delivered.
The file was registered at the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, with Magistrate Dan Anton making a request for absolution, accepted by his colleagues.
Anton invoked that one of the defendants' lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, was his daughter's concubine, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luke defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, who received the greatest punishment in this file.
How the judges motivated the sentence
At the end of last week, the magistrate at Vaslui Court who sentenced the seven young men motivated the sentence.
In motivation the judge talks about the defiant reaction of the defendants, but also of those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among the public.
"The court notes that after the preventive measure of judicial review, a restrictive measure of freedom but not of liberty, under the influence of the defendants' attitude, their families and their local supporters, a strong sense of indignation has been felt at the level of the local and national community that persons accused of serious acts are judged under a less restrictive measure," it shows in the motivation of the Vaslui Court.
The magistrates also dismantled the main defence of the seven defendants who claimed during the trial that the girl they raped would not be "church door."
"The court points out that the moral quality of the injured person is irrelevant, which the defendants wished to highlight by their defenses, since the physical and sexual freedom of a person cannot be violated under any pretext," it further states in the statement of reasons.
Corbyn, Brexit and the future of Europe
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the last decades cannot continue in the coming years.
By Saturday, perhaps a few people knew in Romania who Jeremy Corbyn was.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the Labour Party in Britain, many wonder to what extent a politician can affect our election that, after all, is not in a decision-making position.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical left-wing leader of Labour since the war.
Marxist declared, anti-monarchist (he once asked Tony Blair, then prime minister, to remove the royal family from Buckingam Palace), a fierce anti-American and sympathizer of Vladimir Putin (he was also regularly invited to comment on political events by the television channel "Russia Today"), and the Hizbollah and Hamas terrorist movements, he wants Britain to give up nuclear weapons and to leave NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who at the time considered Osama bin Laden's murder to be a real tragedy, ISIS is almost preferable to the United States.
Following the pattern of all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things like what Tsipras was saying and promising in Greece until he faced the real world and economic legality.
The economic programme of the new Labour leader envisages, inter alia, massive renationalisation and printing of money as a solution for financing development projects and covering very generous social benefits.
Of course, some might wonder why the solution with the printing of money is not universally adopted in the world, we would then have a global overall prosperity!, but who would stumble on such details.
Of course, we can charge bankers for blood, become some kind of left-wing service enemies, but from what we've seen so many times in the past, not just in former communist states or Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of Mitterand and Hollande's mandates.
Additional amounts are quickly swallowed up by generous, uncovering promises made by populist demagogues.
As well as Margaret Thatcher drew attention, "the problem of socialism is that at some point, other people's money runs out."
Few give Jeremy Corbyn a real chance to ever become prime minister.
In the early 1980s another radical left-wing leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme in any case as the party's new leader, failed miserably in the elections.
And then there was still a working class in Britain, in the classic sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were sensibly more influential than they are now.
Under the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant throughout the workforce, and extensive automation has made the industry badly require highly qualified labour, Corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
But even from the opposition, it can influence important developments that can affect us directly.
In his latest Financial Times, he believes that Corbyn's election increases the chances of Brexit and Britain's exit from the EU.
The new Labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership in the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left, Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that imposed the austerity of the poor.
When you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric, and you look at the refugee crisis that shakes from the foundations of the EU, you come to an explosive mix.
And not just for Britain.
But if the British decide following the referendum, which would take place by 2017, to leave the Union with the symbolic loss of capital for the entire European project and the deep failures created within it by the Euro crisis, and that is why refugees, between the North and the South, between the East and the West, leave room for the most worrying scenarios.
All the more so since for a whole series of Member States, London was a counterweight to the Franco-German axis (in which Berlin is becoming the dominant actor anyway).
It's true, the British business environment, the City, are powerful lawyers for staying in the EU.
But today's Europe is no longer the one of the past.
There are many resentments that are growing in intensity these very weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, we even recently had a sample in Jean Clude Junker's speech, increasingly tends to make major decisions over the head of the vast majority of Member States by consulting with just a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And that's when the electoral support for anti-system, anti-immigration formations that are at the same time and eurosceptic increases spectacularly across the continent.
In other words, the negative-load emotional climate has reached higher levels than ever in the past.
Hence the conclusion that the Financial Times draws when assessing the chances of Brexit.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation based on national interest.
If voters make the brain decision, then Britain will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in current politics.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as expected, we will see more integration of the euro area, which will push most of the countries in the region and the periphery of interest, and that of the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States is feeding his populist rhetoric out of the frustrations accumulated in oomormal societies.
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the last decades, the generous social benefits, can no longer continue in the coming years.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro-immigration area, both caused by hasty decisions that have taken into account only integration political ambitions, not the capacity and willingness of European peoples and governments to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and can seriously affect Romania's situation.
And it's hard to rule something out from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to cope with such complicated situations.
Constantin BrÃ¢ncuÅi, the peasant god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Brancusi: "Take and sweep the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to become famous, to be heard about all over the world.
But behind his reputation is something almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories are delivered to us, recipes for success in life.
That something has a name.
It's called toil.
What to write about Constantine BrÃ¢ncuÅi?
What else is there to say?
His face appeared on the bills.
And recently, a well-known bank in Romania hired an actor to play it in a commercial.
Brancusi produces and delivers money almost 60 years after he's been gone.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards named after him.
Besides, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he comes out with the offspring, he hears the following instructions: "We're going to the park, to the Brancusi."
The country is surrounded by its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known by so many people, from children to the elderly.
The infiltration capacity of BrÃ¢ncuÅi is a huge one.
Even the communists failed to remove it from Romania's memory and culture.
Its quotes are spreading over the Internet today, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And then, again, what would there be to say, writing about this man?
Looked at from the pile of books and articles that try to reconstruct his destiny, BrÃ¢ncuÅi's life seems almost fantastic, totally unlikely.
You know, there are those people who tell you that if you weren't lucky enough to be born in some big city and some kind of wealthy family, your chances of success in life are almost nil.
Brancusi's life is the perfect counterexample.
And maybe here would be a key.
Maybe that's where the next text should start.
With a sentence, however detestable these are.
Here are the stupid success stories that are delivered to you daily in newspapers and on TV.
Look carefully at this man's face.
You want to know how he managed in life, how, today, he's heard of an entire world?
It's simple.
He's worked his whole life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantin BrÃ¢ncuÅi was born on 19 February 1876 in Hobitsa, a small village in the municipality of PistiÈani, Gorj County, at the foot of the Carpathians.
She is the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Brancusi.
Although he came from a family of wealthy peasants, BrÃ¢ncuand led a modest life, but one of which he would pick up the landmarks that would guide his late artistic vision.
Remembering his childhood and where he grew up, the artist would confess, in a meeting with Petre ÈuÅ£ea, in Paris, in 1933: "Life was beautiful and harmonious back then."
For millennia, people have lived happily a patriarchal life.
Everything was going from season to season.
And do you know why things have changed?
The civilization of the great city has reached us.
But BrÃ¢ncuÅi's childhood was far from idyllic.
One of the moments spent in these first years of life is extremely suggestive of the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor's years spent in the native village.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Brancusi. A biography," written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantin BrÃ¢ncuÅi was 3 years old.
In the autumn of that year, when the "cauldron" was made, watching those who taste the liquid to see if the process is going well, BrÃ¢ncuÅi catches a moment of general inattention.
He fills his palm search with tits and drinks on the unblown.
He falls into his sleep almost instantly.
The first people don't notice until a few minutes later.
My mother panics, then in hysteria, thinking her son was dead.
In the evening, when the father Radu returns from the vineyard accompanied by praise, he sees from afar the desperate signs of those waiting for him with their breath.
The party will soon turn into mourning.
Father's already thinking about burying.
However, one finds it best to call Baba BrÃ¢nduÅÄ, doctorooi and servant of the BrÃ¢ncuÈilor.
The cheese checks the baby's breath, then puts horse dung under his nose, gathered around.
The child sneezes heavily.
People applaud.
While the boy is allowed to sleep on his drunkenness, for joy, the party with praise continues with even more force.
The next day, the father and son meet through the orchard.
Radu Brancusi has Constantine gather some twigs and bring them to him.
The father puts his child upside down and, with the boy's nuggets, beats him to remember.
And while he feels the sting of the blows, little BrÃ¢ncuÅi has the revelation that the world can be seen from a different perspective and that things around him can turn upside down.
Especially the position of the sun, different from the well-known one, makes him wonder, as he would in his old age, whether the star itself was participating in his disorder.
Could the sun have been as troubled as his father by what had happened to him?
At present, the city is not working
A lawmaker calls on politicians to remember those who voted for them.
Independent MP Viorel BlÄjuÈ called on PSD and PNL to stop domestic fighting and redirect their agenda to the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is a great divide and that's it.
I haven't seen any of the USL projects since 2012 that continue.
No highway, no Regional Emergency Hospital, only see how politicians dispute their possible locations according to real estate interests.
Let's put a little bit of politics aside, get together and talk.
Currently, the city is not working.
"If you're busy with the internal war, you don't have time for those who chose you," Blajut said.
He considered that the current political class had unleashed the Moldovan electorate, with the consequence of being a very small presence at the upcoming local elections, around 30%, representing practically the faithful electorate of the parties.
The Member also believes that voters will also turn to traditional parties, expressing reservations about new political initiatives, as is the party "For Iasi" which will be launched today.
Local parties have very little chance and will only break from the right, not from the PSD.
Such parties rely on civic active people, who are usually right-wing.
"It breaks even more right, which is not good for anyone, nor for PSD," said Furry.
He noted that he was not interested in a run for the upcoming local elections, denying rumors of his intention to join the city.
I also said I don't want to run for any local office.
I am also thinking about whether to continue as an MEP in the next term.
I tried to appeal to the unit for IaÅi and in discussions in the hallways with the other MPs, and I was accused of wanting to make a picture of myself.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this.
"If people voted for us, it does not mean that they are fools to vote for us if they do not see anything," Blajut said, who appreciated that the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the elected.
A colleague from Tatar said he didn't have enough money and had to take the bus.
Let's not be hypocrites.
There's little money.
