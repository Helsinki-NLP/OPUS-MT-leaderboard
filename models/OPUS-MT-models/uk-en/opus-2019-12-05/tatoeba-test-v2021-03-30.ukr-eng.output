We're all leaving.
He was elected president.

Computers are very useful.
It'll be pretty cold tonight.
I lost hope.
I forgot her name.
I'd like to know what you're looking for.
Maybe we should do it.
Here's an example.
She was sad.
I don't know how to thank you.
What a big cat!
She listens to religious music.
It's in any dictionary.
She sells vegetables.
I hope Tom and Mary don't get lost.
Oxygen and hydrogen form water.
Tom threw himself behind Mary.
I'd like to be a famous football player.
We will win.
Tom called you.
I don't know what's changed.
You're with Tom, aren't you?
I need to change.
Do you have a headache?

What kind of accent is that?
My brother loves music.
Let me check.
I've been walking this way for four hours.
Tom bought Mary a ring.
Everyone's looking for happiness.

Now I could die of happiness.
Is that what you want?
Don't talk so fast, please.
Tom cares about Mary.
I don't think I'm gonna stay until I finish the concert.
I wish you a quick recovery.
Tom drinks very little.

Oh, shit.
Don't you think we convinced Tom?
Here we go.
I tried to convince Tom to help us.

Hold your weight with both hands.
The men are crawling at her feet.
Why did Tom decide to do that?
You're lucky?
No wonder she was alive.
Where's the nearest store?
I've already read that book.
I'm not quite sure why this happened.
It's not a big difference.
What's your favorite city?
They call themselves civilized, but they're just as savages as they call barbarians.

Tickets are currently available.
I looked into the bookstore and bought an interesting book.
I'm studying French right now.
So you can eat when he wants to.
Can you close the door?
I know what happened.
Tom must be sick.
Tom said he'd do it again.
Are you alone now?
Just let Tom finish your routine.
Why did Tom escape?
Did he stop here before?
Tom fears Mary's dog.
You want a lie?
Only one week left before Halloween.
He's not always happy.
I've been trying to tell you all about it, so he didn't listen.
Let's sing something together.
Nice to help.
Eurika!
Did you ask others?
Tom met Mary at work.
One more time, what's my password?
It's a nice coat.
You're so shaved.
Let Tom in.
I found the money.

It's a huge mistake.
Maybe you'll come back to me.
Tom's the only one who can't do this.
We can't let it happen again.
Tom doesn't feel safe.
Tom says she won't bother Mary any more.
You're not fair.
He ignored me.
I'm a girl.
I fear dogs.

Stop it!
Maybe it's the same person.
Check the words you cannot speak.
Mary made a suit for her kids at Halloween.
I contacted her.
What did Tom paint?
He didn't look happy.
Do you think we should come in?
It's not him.
I don't think Tom knows when Mary came to Australia.
I bought a lot of books.
Sit down here, please.
Tom wasn't hungry.
Ask Tom if he can do it.
Sitting late every night will harm your health.
Did you know Tom left town?
They love us.
I don't need a computer.
Really?
Let's go now or we'll be late.
That's your main problem.
No matter what, he's still making a fool out of himself.
He fell under the table.
Tom doesn't want you to do this.
Did I change that much?
Have you ever been foreign?
When did you come home?
It'll be hot tomorrow.
We need to talk.
The election was in November.
Nobody knows what happens.
You need to be patient.
Are you paying cash or check?
Tom opened the door?
You think Tom's gonna win?
Italy is a very good country.
How long is Tom gonna be gone?
That's a difficult question.
We both hate Tom.
Tom is irritated.
Don't throw stones away.
Smell it.
Did you know who did it?
Why does that matter?
Why are you staying with Tom?
A lot of insects disappeared overnight.
Tom's inantiable.
Where is the subway station?
No one knows how I feel.
I guess Tom won't be here tonight.
We want to stay three more nights.
He's still too young for this job.
I hit the spot.
I really don't know how else I can explain it.
I'm not sure Tom knows what to do.
You're taller than me.
That's great!
Tom bought Mary a Christmas present.
I realized I wasn't ready.

Don't sell money.
I pray for you.
Our directory will be approved by default.
Aren't you a member of the committee?
I sat next to her.
I never heard Tom speak French.
I thought you said Tom was your brother.
He's honest.
Tom doesn't tell me the truth.
Do you know that song?
I want to know exactly how Tom died.
Life is not fair sometimes.
I don't plan on doing that anymore.
Tom's got a suitcase full of money.
You bastard!
I loved Sister Lila myself.
I bought this book for ten dollars.
Tom is much older than he looks.
Don't be too stubborn.
I'll be back at 6: 30.
Can I ask you a few questions?
They all came back to see Tom.
Where's Dad?
After that, he removed his glasses.
Short hair is very good for her.
Tom's gone.
Grab a chicken before you cook it.
I felt a relief after saying everything I wanted to say.
I bought that sweater.
It's like this.
I love cats.
Are you looking for something specific?
Whose fault is that?
No one's stopping you.
Tom wants to join the team.
You're too skinny.
Come here.
There's a card on the wall.
You're very beautiful.
I came to see you.
What's your favorite pizza trick?
The last point of view has a lot of followers in Japan.
Don't you think you could do that?
I don't know what I can do for you.
Tom's smart.
He's annoying.
If you leave, I'll miss you.
Tell him a clever mistake and he'll thank you for making a stupid mistake, and he'll hurt you.
That's a great idea.
I don't think there's anything out there.
You make your point clear.
We don't know.
Tom must have forgotten to say that to Mary.
Do you happen to know where Tom lives?
I'll invite Tom to dinner.
Maybe I'll do it again.
Do you really think I would do that?
That's a lie.
The war has taken happiness from them.
I wish I had enough money to buy a car.
Mary took her laptop.
You don't have to play with the key.
Wouldn't Tom want to do that?
This bridge is not safe.
Can it wait?
I don't have as hard a suitcase as Tom has.
You're cheating.
I like drinking.
She sells an old-fashioned hat.
I prefer cats more than dogs.
Mary says she can't help us today.
You can go if you've got it.
He admitted his guilt.

I wonder if Tom can do it.
We're sure we can handle this.
Its native country is Germany.
This is an orange.
He's an atheist.
What does your aunt do?
I played with the champion.
Tom warned you that this could happen.
To tell you the truth, I don't agree with you.
Mary said she believed it.
When are you leaving?
I have many friends.
I wish I could stay here forever.
She always has time after dinner.
It takes a smaller part of the Earth's surface.
I have a twin.
We begged Tom not to go there.
I think we may have been too aggressive.
You're big.
I have some free time.
I'll help you tomorrow.
This story had fun with me.
Watch your head!
I'll miss you.
Take this.
Tom asked you to do something?
Tom's dog's name is Cookie.
I just changed my password.
I didn't do anything like that.
It took me about three hours to read this book.
The evil fairy is a toothpick.
I thought it would be nice for you.
Tom didn't want to wait.
I'm loyal.
I'm not very patient.
Jesse spoke badly in French, and German is worse.
I just want to talk to them.
We didn't do anything wrong.
I get into trouble a lot.
Tom's still doing what he needs to do.
He married my brother.
She teaches us French.
He was absent for a meeting.
It's Tuesday.
Someone must have told Tom, but it wasn't me.
Don't worry, we're on our way.
I'm burning quickly.
He took a picture of the family.
We often arrive at Tromos.
The English Bush is perfect.
Do you know what Tom has with a blood group?
I've never been to Europe.
Tom is trying to avoid the dispute with Mary.
They'll understand.
There's only one shop all over the island.
I don't think Tom knows someone who can do it.
Tom is deeply confused.
Is anyone here?
Don't call me.
I'd rather die on my knees than live on my knees.
Tom's waiting.
Tom likes it.
I knew you'd wait for us.
I can't forget her.
They chose a new government.
Please wait five minutes.
I don't want to talk to Tom.
Bring me a clean plate and get me some dirty stuff.
Tom told me he was alone.
This is the church we took in.
I don't think Tom's gonna be missing.
I think that makes sense.
I hope you won't be too disappointed.
He was popular among the voters.
Tom didn't leave French.
Estonia, Queen of England.
Where am I supposed to go?
Tom followed Mary's example.
He gave me a pencil.
It's not that far from here.
Last year, I was going to visit Rome.
This patient can die at any moment.
It was an accident.
It seems to me that if I would talk to a language medium more frequently, my skills in English would get better quickly.
Banana yellow.
We need answers.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Maybe Tom didn't do what everyone said he did.
How do life be?
Wouldn't it be better if Tom did it to someone else?
When was the last time you were in Australia?
He's a vegan himself.
This car is morally obsolete.
Everybody was praying.
How many examples do you need?
I'm the best.
Don't die.

Dance.
I have a great teacher.
We have to kill him.
What are we gonna eat tonight?
Have you found them yet?
You have to give her more time.
What are you doing with this?
She's very hard on him.
You're such an idiot!
Dad bought me a book.
Tom's vigorous.
So I didn't like much.
Tom knew Mary wouldn't be busy.
The dry sand takes the water.
You've always loved Tom, haven't you?
Here you go!
Tom says he can't win.
I'm not doing this.
Tom didn't look offended.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
You want me to bring you a glass of water?
Tom told me he thinks Mary's ugly.
She smiled at me.
You know what they're actresses.
I don't think you're heartless.
It's been built forever.
He passed the exam.
Whose friend are you?
Tom's too tired to work.
Tom threw Mary's ball.
Tom's pretty picky, isn't he?
I miss talking to them.
He tried not to cry.
They're sorry.
Why didn't you ever tell me that?
Who told you I did it?
It's never too late.
Leave me alone, I'm asleep.
Aren't you ready for more?
Tom has no idea why Mary lied.
Tom's looking for a job.
Father will be back in a few days.
Is it true that Midor plays very well with the violin?
Well, that explains it.
You're a total optimist, aren't you?
Every student has a locker.
I'll do the account, please.
I'll see my uncle tomorrow.
You're the most important person in my life.
I hope Tom's gonna change his mind.
I forgot to give you my phone number.
Those are green ducks.
I'll do homework by 9: 00.
Where were you born?
Did you say you and Tom were fighting?
You've got the shoelaces here.
That book sold well in Japan.
I love dancing.
All of these facts have been recognized.
Tom's mad at you, isn't he?
I'd like to be a famous football player.
Am I a worm?
Tell us something.
I'm glad you're doing it.
Because I didn't get the answer, I wrote it again.
What would you like to say about it?
You think it's a trap?
People, stop killing each other.
I wonder if Tom of Mary was planning to do it.
I borrowed Tom's car.
I don't think I could spend six hours alone with you.
There's hardly any furniture.
I'm ready to go, Tom's not.
I feel like a different person.
Whatever happens, I'll stay with you.

Tom didn't poison Mary.
She cried while reading the letter.
You have to tell the truth.
You can be right.
This one looks better.
He's having dinner.
You gave me my word.
I want Tom to wait.
We're here!
Does that bother you?
What's in the box?
Careful, it's still hot.
Tom was acting with Mary, like with a child.
Why are you so sad?
I did it just for fun.
Tom refused to say anything.
Your mother sent you milk and pies.
I recently met someone I think I might fall in love with.
Are you saying you don't want to help us paint the ceiling?
I won't reveal your secret to anyone.
Look at this.
I've never been to Florida.
You're too skinny.
We talked for hours.
I'm very drunk.
Tom told me that he thought Mary could rely on.
Do you agree with their decision?
Put it on my account.
The chick was sticking eggs for a week.
You look good with short hair.
Tom's already in Boston.

Did you see him leave?
Can I talk to Mrs Brown?
He lived in the middle of London.
What happened inside?
Tom said he didn't want to stay in Boston anymore.
What do you like better, summer or winter?
Aren't you planning on doing this?
Fortunately, no one's embarrassed.
No one knows who killed Tom.
It's not as hard as you think.
Why are you mad at me?
Let's get a drink.
You need to wait.
Tom has a lot of friends.
What were you doing today?
I don't know what he knows.
Hello, everyone!
Can I open the conserole?
I'm trying to get some rest.

Where's the phone?
We're cousin and sister.

I hope you enjoy it.
Have you ever seen Tom and Mary do that?
I haven't seen Tom in a hundred years.
She's five.
Your words and lies in your ears!
Tom's coming over next week.
You need to stop doing this right now.
My grandfather speaks very slowly.
Did you win?
She can speak English quite well.
I have to go.
Tom seemed too anxious.
Tom says he's planning to do it.
What he did was not wrong.
Can you give me a minute?
Is there anything cool to drink?
I need to talk to them.
They're too big.
We'll give you another chance.
I could have done it.
Zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
He's a medical student.
You don't have to do that.
I know Tom.

Tom looked out the window and saw Mary's car.
We'll get another chance.
Tom's got a car confiscated and sold it to his new owner.
I hid under my bed.
There's a problem.
I don't really remember what Tom said.
Why did you come back here?
The room is heating up.
Tom can play guitar, I think.
We saw it.
Tom never breaks promises.
That's not a good one.
I think I'm going to play tennis with Tom.
I was outside.
I forgot to do what Tom asked me to do.
I really want to go to Boston.
Let's rest.
I really loved her.
Tom actually came early.
I want a cup of tea.
What does your father do?
I'm a loser.
Do you know my wife?
Tom started studying French.
Tom's pissed off on fruit ice cream.
Don't be naive to say so.
Stop feeding that piece of pie!
I told Tom everything.
I had lunch three hours ago.
It must be a joke, huh?
Tom had an accident at work.
You're not upset, are you?
We have half a dozen eggs.
Tom refused to leave.
She had coffee.
Tom repeated what Mary said.
So it was thirteen when he died.
I wish you luck.
He used to read a lot.
What do you think really happened?
My mom put it on the table.
Please, bring me a clean knife.
Mary's patience, isn't she?
Do you think Tom is part of the problem?
Tom didn't want to go for a walk.
Tom's waiting for me at the station.
I'll put the cream to my coffee.
I can't bear to carry this loon anymore.
Please don't go yet.
I was surprised by Tom's sincerity.
I reread the letters you sent me.
Have you ever seen a car accident?
I understand you were joking.
Do you want to learn how to play guitar?
I didn't want to dance.
Wait, I'll pay for it.
We're sure of his success.
The gods punish sinners.
Have you ever taken out the Statue of Liberty?
I have an idea.
I just bought some cardboard.
I'm too old for Tom.
This party is boring.
Why did you come home today?
Aren't you a musician?
Don't you want me to do something?
Tom can't change that.
Would you like Tom to do that to you?
Did you know Tom was lonely?
Mary's my older sister.
He finally succeeded.
It's too expensive!
Number's ready.
I want it now.
Tom, I want to stay with you.
I don't like lending money to anyone.
We're teachers.
We're in the extraction zone.
She drowned in the lake.
You need to stop doing this.
That's a good question.
Mom, can I swim?
You think I'm crazy?
This bus is going to Minsk.
I need to find them now.
My mother likes eating homemade cheese.
Nothing new.
I love her.
Would you like to have dinner with me sometime?
I completely agree.
Is that what you wanted to say?
You want a banana?
We need to be at work by 9: 00.
We all slept.
I haven't washed my hands yet.
Which one?
Tom went to see Mary.
I have money.
I thought Tom understood.
Do you have a big family?
I'm a tax payer.
Tom has a pen in his right hand.
There's a lot of coffee.
I'm glad you're okay.
Tom recognized me.
You're lying.
Tom followed Mary outside.
Tom kissed Mary, not John.
I have other plans for you.
Do you see Tom?
I like riding my bike.
The bullet found its purpose.
Tom ran to catch up with Mary.
What can I do for you?
Tom was convicted and condemned to death.
It'll be our secret.
What time did you go to bed last night?
I'm not marrying you.
It's going to be a risk to do it.
I don't want to be punished.
I don't eat green pepper at all.
The meat sucked terribly.
My sister started crying.
I'm just trying to help.
This is my dictionary.
Tom and I are both tired.
The Foy sings all day.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
I wonder if this actually works.
What are they up to?
Revenge is a dish that seems cold.
She's your queen.
I asked Tom what to do.
I don't think Tom can ride a one-knee bike.
I'm too low.
They had guns.
I doubt Tom's ever decided to go to Australia.
Keep away from the context.
That's my dog.
Tom's been working all day.
Does it matter?
Tom's eyes aren't used to darkness yet, so he hasn't seen anything.
You can't smoke in this room.
He'll come tomorrow.
I hate that photo.
I could smell him.
Don't you start to get tired?
I pray.
It smells awful to take the bench off.
Russian is a complicated language.
Thank you for telling me the truth.
He slipped his ankle.
Tom told me.
Are you sure Tom would do that?
When she finished working, she went home.
Who wants to come with me?
Tom said it wouldn't be hard to do it.
It seems that there are too many Turkish trolls on Tatobe.
Why are you breaking up?
Is this just a coincidence?
Tom may not know where Mary is.
Nothing works.
Tom's still playing golf, isn't he?
How could you let him do it to you?
What did you say to Tom?
She lives almost close.
Don't drink too much coffee.
Can you answer that?
What happened on October 20th?
I suspect Tom had nothing to do with it.
If you have any questions, let me know.
I'll deal with Tom.
I want to kiss you.
He was too busy all day.
Tom will come back, I'm sure he'll be back.
He managed to escape.
I wonder what Tom thinks.
Tom will bring Mary.
None of us speak French.
She saw him drink the thread.
You have to say because you can't do it.
Tom was significantly late.
Tom speaks well in French.
Tom said he couldn't find anything to eat.
It's a nice day today.
The fashion changes quickly.
I'm absolutely confused.
I couldn't see who it was.
Last year there was a bad harvest.
Tom betrayed you.
I was fucked up.
Can you tell me where the egg is?
Tom's a friendly boy.
He's eating now.
Eukaryotic cells have a nucleus.
It's about to start.
I still have the key to Tom's house.
She's been talking about her foreign experience for a long time.
They're all hungry.
You don't have to worry about it.
Jesus makes me tired.
Be reasonable.
That scares me.
You really need to help, so you can do it.
Mary says she won't do it.
We'll vote today.
They didn't have any food.
The religion of one age is a literary proof of the next.
I think we'll be back soon.
What a catastrophe!
I made apple pie for you.
Mary's lower from Tom.
Abraham Lincoln is a famous man.
Tom has no enemies.
She's afraid to go abroad.
I was born like this.
Please correct it.
Why are you talking to Tom in French?
I worked.
I wasn't allowed to see her.
Tom's asleep well?
Tom and Mary told John.
The elevator wasn't working.
You're beautiful.
There's no one here but me.
Tom didn't want to do this to you.
I saw you on TV.
Faso's mother got married the second time.
He's got ten cows.
I like English.
You're cruel.
It looks like the fall is already here.
I saw a man walk into the room.
He's nothing but a fool.
I was afraid it would happen.
Who else was at the meeting?
He talks too fast.
Tom offered Mary a pretty good job.
Tom's gonna help you?
She has a beautiful face.
Tom didn't want that.
This guy can't tell the truth from the sinner.
You're a panda.
I'm not sure where my hotel is.
Which candy do you like?
I almost forgot it was his birthday.
What keeps you so late?
Leila was blaming Faso for seeing other women.
Go with Tom.
I thought he was gonna come alone.
Tom Jackson is my boss.
That's my brother.
Can you tell me where I can find the hotel?
I'm kidding.
I think I asked you a good question.
Okay, I have to make a proposition.
Lithuania enters the European Union.
It was justified.
I taught my wife to drive.
I stopped doing that.
Who's your lost figure?
Teacher has made us notice that we should behave quietly.
What's the real reason Tom's not here?
Stop twisting my words.
Tom disappeared without trace.
Tom is asking us to help him.
I'm from Denmark.
I love skyscrapers.
I'm not your slave.
Get your things out of here.
Am I right?
I no longer go to church.
My name is Henry.
Tom knows he has to keep working.
Tom's not going to drive a car to Boston.
I'm still afraid of doing this.
I don't want to do this alone.
Tom didn't know he had a secret admirer.
Tom is following Mary.
I still don't like Tom.
So we'd better stay home.
Tom seems to be getting better.
Did you know Tom?
Tom said he had many friends in Boston.
Food's coming off.
Tom and Mary are fine.
I can see myself in the mirror.
It would be nice to see Tom again.
Ten minutes to the bus station.
Why doesn't Tom plan on doing that?
Tom eats a lot.
Tom is taller than me.
That's exactly what I didn't think of.
I did.
There's a cherry in Washington right now.
Do you know a nice restaurant?
Tom was the oldest in our class.
He's three years older than her.
What if our plan doesn't work?
Here's water.
You're always careful.
Tom didn't expect anyone.
I have to hurry to the station to get on the last train.
I don't understand, and I'm not used to understanding.
I've been listening to jazz all morning.
Tom used to hang out with Mary and John.
The girl dressed in white is my fiancee.
Tom's gone.
The door opens at 2: 30 in the morning.
I want you to talk to Tom about his behavior.
I'm not in love with Layla.
He was only 14.
I'm going to teach you how to play chess.
The moon's coming down.
Anyway, I just can't accept it.
Did you find any problems?
Who's coming?
Tomorrow is the day off.
Tom's pretty shy, isn't he?
Mia found out Tom had an accident.
I hope you come back.
Is there anything you'd like to buy?
You told me to do this.
Tom and Mary are superheroes.
Tom wants me to apologize.
Try not to cry.
You have very sharp ears.
Can I do that again?
Are your children still asleep?
You have to try again.
Is Tom a Christian?
I want to see what happens.
Tom sat down in front of Mary.
I have less money than you.
Tom lives in Boston, right?
He's an office worker.
You think Tom's gonna win, don't you?
Could you please stop?
They were following you.
I'm waiting for your answer.
Tom was out of socks.
Tom's room is locked.
Of course I would.
Please do it quickly.
He agreed with me.
Could you show me the way to the port?
What were you doing last night?
Tom is a good doctor.
Don't you want this job?
Tom said he needed to buy something to eat.
Tom thinks Mary's innocent.
I've been waiting in the rain for at least ten minutes.
I wonder if Tom already told Mary that she had to do it.
Do you use modern technology?
You've been working.
Tom's in his room.
Have you seen anyone besides Tom last night?
Is this a reliable list?
Stay away from the fence.
Is it going to rain again today?
I don't know what Tom promised.
Are you ready to go?
Please take off your shoes.
We need some money.
I knew all about it.
Do I have to do this now?
Kate's trying to walk around the back.
No one knows you're a cat on the Internet.
Girls are so alike that I can't tell them apart.
Tony broke it.
What's the holdup?
It was easy to answer.
Thank you for the information.
I have the right to know the truth.
I can't confirm it.
Where can I get my luggage?
Tom said he was hoping that Mary could win.
Wake up the kids.
We drank a lot.
Who else did you tell?
Tom lost his voice.
Is that your beer?
Security is not guaranteed.
I haven't seen them.
Tom's dancing.
Give me your wallet.
You have nothing.
Even a teacher might be wrong.
We were disappointed in him.
Tom, maybe he's dead by now.
I'm gay.
Why am I so tired?
Wait until the end of my exam.
How many children do you have?
I'm not done with Tom yet.
There are thousands of passengers in Ukraine.
You're very persistent, aren't you?
I didn't testify.
We need to get going fast.
Does anyone know the name of the deceased?
Here's the news.
Did you read that book?
You're not tall enough.
I just came from school.
I have nothing to do with that.
Do you like Japanese food?
I'm sorry Tom thinks so.
You look surprised.
Wow, that looks delicious.
Have you ever been stuck in the elevator?
The operation can't wait.
What time did this happen?
Don't try it yourself.
There were no survivors.
They lost a DNA sample.
If I had time, I'd visit Tom.
Put it on the shelf.
Tom can't come.
I don't know where Tom is.
Your prophecy has come true.
The jEdit samples are spelled at BeanShell.
You want to go to the concert with us?
Is that a fire machine?
All food and drinking is delicious and useful, but you need to know time, place and measure.
I think it's a good compliment.
I wonder if she'll recognize me after all these years.
I'm a little uncomfortable sometimes.
I know you don't trust us.
I didn't kill anyone.
I don't think Tom's gonna be in Australia next week.
Tom had to wait.
You ate.
I haven't seen him for about three years.
I'm afraid I won't finish the report in time.
It's unlikely that I'll be there tonight.
I don't trust you.
She's traveling the world.
The guys are fine.
I wonder if Tom told Mary she should do it.
Tom said he needed money.
You're good.
What does he look like?
I don't live in Boston anymore, I moved to Chicago.
This only happened once.
You can see the Fujo Mountain from there.
Human-like apes are smart.
It's already begun.
Does your father know about that?
Tom's a photo addict.
Please don't interrupt me for a while.
The man tried to adopt his antenna.
They don't even know why.
Liar!
Well, maybe you're right.
The Institute is a waste of time.
Tom fucked up at his sister's wedding.
Do you know where Tom is?
That kitten is very nice.
Give me something to write.
I really like Tom.
We have no lessons tomorrow.
I want to learn Hebrew.
There's an orange on the table.
Never leave me alone with Tom.
Mary does everything she has to do to Tom.
It's a very good movie.
Why doesn't anyone answer?
Tom told me he had a flu, I think.
My blood's gone.
You gave me good advice.
It's not Tom's bike.
I thought you lost my watch.
I don't remember you at all.
These houses are my uncle.
I just did my job.
Tom never called.
Nobody knows what happens.
We're always waiting for something.
Thank you very much.
I didn't apologize.
A lot of young people coming to Hawaii.
Tom is my twin brother.
At this point, there's no comment.
Tom, I want to stay with you.
Don't resist.
You'll pay for it!
Do you understand me?
Tom's been stabbed.
Tom thinks that Mary can do it?
Is that your hat?
Remember, you're gunpowder.
You want me to come with you?
Is she white?
You like roses, you burn, and you like barley.
Do you like coconut water?
Barcelona is in Spain.
He's very sensitive.
There's only one cookie left.
I wanted to see this film with you.
I learned how to dive in five years.
Tom fears that Mary's feelings may be forgotten.
Tom tried to save Mary.
I'm here in time.
Where's your luggage?
She quit the company.
She'll try it again.
They found traces of snow on the ground.
My friends believe that partisan is a joke.
Do what I say, not how I do it.
Tom's always got the sweetest photos in his profile.
I got in a cab.
It's always easy for him to deliver.
Anyway, it won't surprise me.
You'll regret it.
Tom came here about two hundred and thirty.
Cat was protecting her kittens.
It's not his handwriting.
You can say anything.
There's enough for one day.
Tom gave Mary her heart.
I don't think Tom will remember me.
He speaks German.
Tom's not as busy as you are.
Why do you need so many shoes?
You're very brave.
I'm totally naked.
No one's heard anything about my country.
He became a national hero.
Tom said where did he do that?
We study Chinese.
How do I get on the other side?
Do we have a choice?
You're welcome.
Let me see.
Tom started to realize what was going on.
Promise me you'll come.
Take your coat off.
He runs to the station every morning.
They're running out of poetry.
Not here.
No one was happy.
I hope so.
I'm such an idiot.
I tried to sleep.
Tom's always on the net.
I moved here from Boston.
Tom just sent me a text message.
So somewhere in this building.
Tomorrow we're open.
I didn't expect such a turn of events.
I think I'll start with a bottle of beer.
I asked him what his name was.
When do you want to go?
There has to be some logic.
Did you work last night?
How did you convince Tom to help us paint the feces?
Were you in the capital of the United States, Washington?
Mary held a balance.
I was just lucky.
They're very subjective.
It's a marriage.
I wonder if Tom's angry or not.
I have to get ready for the test.
The plane flew east.
Don't let him touch it.
Tom says he's your friend.
In Soviet Russia, the TV is watching!
He called me.
He invited her to the concert.
What does the suspect look like?
No one could stop it.
Tom died of starvation.
I'm glad you're here.
I let the cat in.
I left your umbrella on the bus.
The water in the children's room.
Is this animal eating people?
Are you a vegetarian?
Do you want to live forever?
Listen to what I have to say.
He'll be here soon.
Can't you lift me?
I'm not pregnant.
He didn't break.
I have a question.
We missed you!
Tom said Mary must still be doing it.
I'm not sure I agree with him.
The warden let me leave early today.
What time is the end of the world?
I never worry.
That's so sweet!
When I'm in a bad mood, I start singing.
I don't owe him anything.
Where's your key?
It's gonna be pretty cold tonight.
I won't ask Tom for help.
How much you paid to do it.
You don't have to stay.
One day we'll see each other again.
You said you wouldn't do it.
It was a long list.
Don't tell anyone.
I've got to go.
I was broke.
Tom outplayed me.
How many people died?
Did these guys do anything to you?
Is Mike a member of the swim band?
Tom is following orders.
You're not listening.
They didn't find anything.
Don't be angry.
I'm Antonio.
This land belongs to the royal family.
These rumors are true?
We really want that, don't we?
Finally, he was willing to make her an offer.
Tom was a little surprised that Mary spoke French so well.
I know you're here.
It's about half a third.
Aren't you glad you're rich?
There is no hope.
It's not mine.
What exactly do you want, Tom?
We're almost everything.
So we have to be home by 2: 30.
You walk to school?
Is that Tom's girlfriend?
Tom's wasting his time.
The molecule is made up of atoms.
We realize that.
It's not a good time.
Do you have time to dine with me?
Too bad he didn't come to the meeting.
Where do you live now?
You know, it's been through a difficult period recently.
Tom married a neighbor.
I have a headache.
Say again, please.
I'll be with you in a second.
I study English.
Nice weather, isn't it?
Come if you can.
I hate it!
You're a little young to me.
Tom's too old for you.
Tom said she was hoping Mary would do it.
Tom didn't look around.
My parents just arrived at the station.
I was waving with my hand.
Did you buy a Christmas present this year for Tom?
He had something to do with this robbery.
My cat looks sad.
Tom and Mary only eat the vegetables that grow themselves.
Tom showed his driver's license to the police.
Show me what's in your pocket.
She collected fragments of broken dishes.
When does it start?
Tom felt good.
What did you learn today?
I work alone.
The Thomas team scored 96 points. 55 points were taken in the first time. How many points were taken in the second time?
Your shoes are right here, and mine?
We're on our way home.
Tom said Mary wouldn't worry.
I'll be back in less than five minutes.
You aim not high enough.
I'd like to order a sandwich.
Tom gave me a present.
Where's Dad?
Who else helped you?
I'd love to help you.
Are you older than 18?
The dog's trying to escape.
Tom can't read.
I just bought a boat.
Tom had no idea that Mary had a crush on him.
Tom's disgusting.
The pharmacy is on Freuna Street.
Tom's your uncle, isn't he?
Are you ready to hear the bad news?
I talked to them.
Has Lucy called yet?
Looks like Tom.
You don't have to do this if you don't want to.
I was just about to get cleaned up.
Enjoy your meal!
Did Tom mention any problems?
Where does Tom have to do that?
Mary wants me on her team.
No one else listens.
You're brave.
You have to do it yourself.
That means Tom was right.
I'll sit over there.
Put it down.
Tom's the last one.
Guards will be fired before Christmas.
Mary ate it alone.
You're really gonna find them, right?
I don't tolerate moisture well.
Are you sure Tom's coming?
Where did you get that key from?
Can I help you, ma'am?
I don't think I'll be intimidated.
Tom will go instead of you.
Do you think fish hear?
Tom quit last night.
The woman reads.
Poor Tom's been trying to sleep for three hours.
Tom moved to Australia.
We need to remember that.
I changed Wi-Fi's password.
It's not my problem.
I thought you lost my watch.
They're brothers.

I lured my spoon.
I kissed Tom yesterday.
Why did Tom kill Mary?
Tom said it wasn't.
Let's stop this discussion.
Tom cleaned the apple.
Tom didn't read the report you wrote.
Did you talk to Tom about that?
No one would help me do that.
You're Italian.
What is she like?
The tank thief pulled his passport from Mark.
I think you like him.
This journal costs only two pounds, including delivery.
I'll miss you.
I sat on a bench next to Tom.
They love each other.
Come tomorrow.
What insect did you eat?
I saw tom hit the car.
Tom can go.
Tell me where the wine is.
You can do it.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know what the stapler looks like.
I can't confirm it.
Mary will guarantee it.
I got the wrong bus.
I gave up that offer.
Mary already did what she had to do.
I watched Tom.
You reserved the table?
Where's the money going?
My grandfather was a hero.
I don't like this one.
Use them all.
You were right.
I don't want you to die.
Turn off the mobile, please.
I'm not rich.
I never thought you'd understand.
Do you recognize this man?
How about you ride a picnic?
We couldn't buy tickets for a concert until we got the money from our friends.
Tom called Mary this morning.
Maybe some other time.
Tom refused to let Mary in the house.
Tom's not very good at tennis.
I'm Palestinian.
There's no way I can do it alone.
That's why you need to be here.
We've run out of oil.
What do you think they want?
People who live in a place cannot know the pleasure of living in a village.
Mary has beautiful eyes.
She gave me a book for Christmas.
I want a cheeseburger, a Coke and a potato.
She stole the camera.
Welcome to your new home!
There's a problem with my account.
Tom was happy to agree.
I think Tom's wrong.
Are you all right?
Maybe you're the only one who can do it.
Who's wrong?
Your singing makes professional singers red from shame.
You know Tom's lying.
I thought you were Tom.
I don't need a knife.
Oh, my God!
Tom's clean.
He was big.
Tom knows it wasn't Mary.
Esther's a lesbian Jew.
I was bitten by a dog last week.
You want me to ask him?
Tom and I are not afraid of Mary.
Try to swim!
You're lucky to have such a good job.
What are you holding in your hand?
We're busy.
It's time for dinner.
It's unlikely Tom would forget how to do it.
Are you drinking?
Is Tom going to do this with you?
Are you awake?
The meeting began at five days.
Mary said she liked to do it.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom knew Mary wasn't busy.
I was in Tokyo just once.
I got an invoice on electricity.
What color is his sweater?
I bought a new car last week.
I'm sure Tom will be fine.
He cut his finger with a knife.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary so much.
I wonder why Tom was planning to do it.
All members are obligatory.
Aren't you comfortable?
You underestimated them.
Your parents would be proud of you.
I was born in May.
I agree too.
I'm lucky.
A little cup of coffee costs two euros.
I wonder if I can do it again.
We have to decide today.
Who are you planning on doing this with?
We're happy with this decision.
That skirt is cheap.
I saw Tom kiss Mary.
He was standing in the door.
She cried bitterly.
Tom was angry with his sins.
You always say that to me.
Is that Mary's husband?
You'll find out.
A witness who has seen everything on his own is worth more than ten witnesses who have heard everything.
Guess who I am.
Tom returned to the hotel.
How easy is English?
I play tennis for an hour a day.
Tom's finished.
When I went into the room, she played the piano.
You're very nice.
Where are your manners?
They didn't lose hope.
Tom threw an egg at Mary's.
When do you expect to come?
Tom fixed his shirt.
Tom went to the library.
We need to call the police.
Tom decided to leave early.
Tom told you where the party is?
Mary's tall.
Why are you so surprised?
It's a chair.
Tom didn't want to wait.
She filled this vase with water.
Tom doesn't hate Mary.
All right, I'll bite you.
I don't want any more.
You know what she likes with colors?
I guess Tom won't be here tonight.
Tom opened the restaurant.
I have to keep trying.
I'm glad you're happy.
I'm going to love your good health.
Yes, I'd love to!
She started playing the old song.
Why do they speak French?
That's a lie.
There is no pyramid in Europe.
It's spring soon.
It speaks two foreign languages.
It's too much.
Tom says I'm too naive.
Why are you telling me this?
Let's go back.
Tom's not crazy.
Don't even think about it.
Tom's very annoying.
Are you afraid?
You ruined my life.
We need to come up with a secret language.
Are you planning to stay long?
When are you planning on going to Japan?
My kids are at school.
I put my suitcase on it.
I got out of the car.
Tom has a younger brother named John.
Is there anything you'd like to buy?
I'm old.
I'm thinking about you.
I just did my job.
Where did all these cars come from?
I live in a giant bucket.
We're gonna have salt on the wound.
She refused to speak English.
Tom didn't know where to look.
We hit the river.
He obviously loves you.
Why is Tom so popular?
Tom's younger than you.
I'm a French teacher.
Tom is very open.
I'm hungry because I didn't eat.
I don't blame anyone.
The plane flew at 9: 00.
Tom speaks pretty freely in French.
John caught a tiger and shot two lions.
Don't worry, I'll check it out myself.
Tom is hanged with a dry towel.
What happened to Tom?
It's a bracelet.
I have a lot of time.
Let me be happy.
She wants to wait until the wedding.
I'm a little late.
I need facts.
She couldn't defend herself.
Tom leaves Boston next month.
Careful, it's still hot.
Let's kiss.
There are millions of people dying of starvation every year.
I was wondering what Tom wanted.
There was a wrong address on the letter.
This is the last train.
Who will fight?
I found a meteor.
I'm not happy at all.
It's all chocolate.
They went to another religion.
I have to be careful.
I've been scanning them.
Mary sold the car.
Thank you for your hospitality.
What's he planning?
You're the best!
Are you ever gonna do that?
We could save them.
He's a weird person.
I just got a haircut.
Mary said she never studied French.
I think I'll buy a new car.
It's our fault.
You're so cute.
It's going to cost about fifteen dollars.
I was knocking the door.
His theory is worth noting.
We're ashamed of Tom.
Help is too late.
It's not a new problem.
My grandfather is very uncomfortable.
I wrote these books myself.
She's a tennis player.
So Tom became famous.
You had a good time, didn't you?
You sang.
I did everything perfect.
I love writing.
Kyoto is an extraordinary beautiful city.
Next month, I'm sixteen.
Do you think there's a probability that this is going to happen?
Deal with your dreams.
What time is your last lesson going to be?
I came to say goodbye, Tom.
I like this dog.
I tried to get in touch with her.
What does she have?
How's the exam?
Where did this book go?
Tom said I'm not tired.
Tom and Mary are doing this.
We have to help Tom.
It's been raining all day.
I was upset about that.
Can I have your phone number?
You need to stop.
Tom's going to Boston.
Who said you could do this?
Why did you buy a flower?
The watch will last for ten minutes.
Tom wants to be a doctor.
Speak quietly.
The sun is shining during the day, and the moon is at night.
I'm on her.
You were right before.
I hope Tom can help us.
You have the right to be happy.
What's your rating?
I'm having trouble with my boss.
It's banana.
Tom will probably be punished for what he did.
Mary's your girlfriend?
London has caught a fog.
I'm really glad you're here, Tom.
Tom is weak.
I told him to come to Australia.
You usually travel abroad?
You must be flexible.
I believe you will win.
She went to the airport to start him.
Move away.
He's in the kitchen.
Please, don't get mad.
They won't tell us.
Work slowly.
Brazil's face is Brazil.
What I really want is to sleep.
I still have to pay the bill on my phone.
Tom can cook.
But the music doesn't make him nervous.
What languages are spoken in America?
You deserve to rest.
These are the fresh ones.
Tom has huge eyes.
There are seven colors in the rainbow.
I guess that's why we don't have to do this.
He's gloomy today.
I wish we could spend more time together.
Listen to his frank opinion.
Aren't you on duty tonight?
Tom never had to learn much.
How's your wife, Tom?
I accept your offer.
Bill's got a lot of friends.
That would be unfair.
That's where you should go, or you or Jane.
If I were you, I'd ignore it.
Tom will be right here right now.
These are the most expensive shoes I've ever seen.
It's a Greek name.
You think I'm joking?
I was very tired today.
I'm true.
Happiness is not about having a lot of stuff.
It's all over Japan.
Tom showed up on the side of the mountain.
Taxi's coming.
I heard him go down the stairs.
That's mine.
That's weird!
Do you know how to read Cyrillic?
I know Tom pretty well.
I shouldn't have come here.
Tom's neat, isn't he?
I wish you weren't such a fucking asshole.
Tom gave you something for me?
I could never do that without your help.
For breakfast, I always have coffee and singers.
I'm hungry because I didn't have breakfast.
I'm the best.
How did your exam go?
Can I pay later?
Did that just happen?
Mary didn't bring an umbrella with her.
Did you hear me?
To tell you the truth, I said the wrong thing.
I'm going to bed!
He doesn't like eggs.
I found the money.
I don't understand why he did it.
They're all tourists.
Can you lend me a pint?
This is your life.
Tom said he wants to drink.
I wonder if Tom once asked Mary why she didn't.
Patrick doesn't know how to write.
I was too embarrassed.
I went into detail.
Tom said he didn't want to do it.
Let's go to the oceanic.
You know what caused the problem?
Where is Boston?
I need your opinion.
Don't worry, she doesn't speak German.
Is she hiding anything?
Tom said he was interested.
I have a good appetite today.
We're comfortable in our new home.
There are only two gentle things in the world, the universe, and the sound of stupid things.
She said, "I'm very happy."
It's interesting to talk to Tom.
What you sow, you reap.
What are you looking at?
Can we go faster?
We're not just football.
All the meat's been ruined.
I was so born.
Tom and I were running on the track.
He came home late last night.
The U.K. National Health Service has updated recommendations today about the coronarvirus.
Grab the rope.
Tom and I drink the same thing.
He couldn't resist the urge to smoke another cigarette.
There's a secret passage.
I don't want to argue with you.
Let me in.
She's inseparable.
I thought Tom wouldn't give up on it.
I love you.
What floor do you live on?
Tom was a little confused.
He signed the check.
Hey, how are you?
Password - "Muriel."
Did you hear what Tom said?
Tom reads novels.
Get the garbage.
You're my friend.
He's got two cars.
They realized.
No problem!
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
Can I borrow your scissors?
Thank her for helping me.
Tom confirmed no one was hurt.
The house slept with 25 men overnight and then killed them.
They went to the zoo.
I was shy.
They're not rich.
Take my hand, we'll both build a utopia.
Tom said Mary was confused.
One of them is not true.
Harvard was founded in 1636.
Do you really want to go to Boston alone?
It's hot today.
God gave it, God took it.
Where far from to Boston?
I was laughing at his joke.
My father may be asleep.
How do we best learn French?
I'm a bureaucrat.
I was born on October 10th, 1972.
I was able to solve the problem.
I'm sure he can afford it.
Do you use alcohol drinks?
My parents are going to fight again.
I like chess.
Mary's a blonde.
I got it in my pocket.
She speaks well in English.
Tom just doesn't make a fool of it.
We have a great team.
My name was upstairs.
I doubt her words.
Tom has a piano.
What are you doing about this?
I meet her demands.
Forget this sad event.
Please, take it away.
No one likes to lose.
I think that's why we're going to love it.
I go to the library at least once a week.
I want some coffee.
How did you learn French?
We already know what you did.
The Klinin is embroidered.
Tom eats cookies in the dark.
Did you ask Tom?
Thanks to God, everyone was fine.
We're a perfect couple.
Fudge talks too much.
That's what you really have to do.
Tom's still in Boston.
Do you believe what Tom said?
I left to drink a beer.
Tom says I'm a bottleneck.
I did it, too.
What are you gonna do tomorrow?
This is my wife Oyota.
This student is American.
The cloud is gray.
No one's seen us.
I'll wait here.
She lived in Tokyo when she was young.
Does any of this matter?
This is my e-mail.
Tom will do it if you pay him for it.
Silence is sleeping.
It's Valentine's Day.
I'm not clear what I'm supposed to do.
Tom holds a diary.
Tell me the truth, please.
We've ordered too much food.
I'm not a student.
I'm already late for school.
I couldn't solve this problem.
We don't have time.
Make me look like I'm a stranger.
She's much better.
Do you know any other solutions?
In other words, he's lazy.
I used the opportunity to visit the museum.
Tom and Mary are avoiding John.
My memory is no longer the same.
Tom loves Mary very much.
Tom's cooking dinner.
Dog's smart.
I can't remove photos from the camera!
I was amazed to find out what I won.
I wonder if Tom told Mary she should do it.
All dogs are animals, but that doesn't mean all animals are dogs.
Those who can only come up with one way to write a word obviously lack of imagination.
I'm sure of his success.
Tom didn't do it.
Where's the nearest subway station?
Tom escaped through the window.
You don't hide anything?
How are you?
I didn't know it was gonna happen.
I have many friends.
You can do it right now.
No speed limit.
Tom's a bit red.
That's what you have to do.
I should probably spend some time with Tom.
You know how to drive a car?
How did you know it would happen?
I forgot his name.
What's your favorite number?
School looks like a prison.
It's too complicated.
What exactly did you see?
I just need a minute.
This is her car.
The devil is lying in bed.
Tom's not here.
I've got a three-year-old deal.
Taxi's coming.
Dan was attacked by two unknown people.
I don't want to park too close to Tom's car.
Tom put his hand on Mary's knee.
To your own.
It's so good you're back.
You need to sit down with Tom.
I thought it was a good idea.
I just had lunch.
I won't see them.
Aren't you a Bachelor too?
It's part of the system.
Who did Tom sell his car?
This spoon is for soup.
Let's go to Boston with me.
Tell me you want Christmas.
Drop the ball.
Don't touch this button!
In English, the verb prefers the appendix.

Is Tom still asleep?
Let them help you.
Lived to live so close to the station.
Have you ever sang French?
Slow down.
Tom brought someone to a party?
It's Christmas.
It's an alkaline decoration.
You said it was important.
Can you help me?
Tom said he was hoping that Mary could win.
I think they're students.
I'm just saying that you did well with your job.
I think you said enough.
I'm a client.
I'm very greedy.
You're crazy.
Tom won't bother Mary any more.
Answer me right now.
I had a suspicion Tom was missing the house.
Tom hasn't done this since last year.
You finished complaining?
Aren't you Mary's husband?
They speak English?
No one saw Tom.
The police have continued their investigation.
I think I know what Tom would do.
Tom said he was too busy.
What are you going to do today?
I love this game.
How's Emily?
We don't care.
We do what we have to do.

Let's order pizza.
Tom's not an idiot.
It was very cold.
We need to talk.

This store has better burgers than that.
Where's Tom now?
It can go fast.
I need this information as soon as possible.

I'm not ashamed of what I've done.
I think you should go there with Tom.
He saw her and turned red.
Don't you want to be famous?
I'm not gonna disappear.
I almost won.
I nodded my head.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
Tom wanted to come with us to Boston.
Any of you guys were in Hawaii?

Do you think they'll find Tom?
Give him the microphone.
He could have done it.
Some people believe Japan number one is everything.
Tom is buying games.
We thought he was American.
Let me smoke a cigarette.
You're just a boy.
She has big tits.
We're cool.
Don't turn the lights off.
I'm not a millionaire.
He refused to tell me what happened.
Most people think that.
Oh, he's like taking a cow...
Why do you think Tom couldn't do that?
She was brave.
Nobody knows.

It'll be fun.
What time did you go to bed last night?
Are you in the barn?

I'm not part of the middle class.
You have no idea how to speak in public.

She can't read or read.
It's down the street on the left.
Did you tell him you got mugged?

We don't do that.
How could we do that?
Stay away from this.

You're gonna need more money, right?
Why are you doing this?

Tom sent Mary a text.
I had a good meal.
It is foolish of you to reject his offer.
Tom's a cyborg.
So you didn't have to go with Mary.
Where do you speak English?
Maybe that's why it's boring.
I was hoping Tom wouldn't be busy.
I have to go.

Is Tom here?
This is a painting Tom wrote.
Give Tom a kiss.

Wake up!
Yeah, I've lived there for years.
Have you seen her today?
I know you won't.
What did you get for Christmas?

I'm not illiterate.
Don't think Tom'll forget how it's done.
Dinner is served at 9: 30.
I'm waiting for him.

Just help me.
I know what that looks like.
The policeman was drunk.
Experts aren't convinced.
Tom leaned to kiss Mary in the cheek.
I'll go straight to business, you're fired.

Have you ever been abroad?
I'm fussy.
Can't you see what Tom and Mary are doing?

Everyone who knew him admired him.
Yesterday I met Mary on the street.
Do you have a vacancy?
Why don't we go dance?
You know it's a lie, right?
I'll do whatever you tell me.
I think Tom might convince Mary to do it.
Tom and Mary are rich.
Dog white.
That was our plan.
Talk quietly.
Who do you plan to go to Boston to?
Are you planning on rent a car?
I always feel sleepy.
I'm also going to do it.
It's a sister's picture.
Am I different from you?
You're a beautiful butterfly.
I already knew that.

Tomorrow's a big day.
Is work over yet?
Drop some water.
It's a lot of fun.
Tom smiled by a waitress.
You don't need to.
Tom's not buying that car.
Even a kid could handle it.
You have a copy of that report?
Tom never wakes up.
That's enough for now.
I could swim.
Did you buy Tom a dog?
I think everyone's busy.
I can't accept it.
You're very beautiful.
Take this.
Tom's past.
Tom will be released on Monday.
Tom said I should do it.
It's gonna be okay.
I'll see Mary in the afternoon.
I haven't read any of these two books.
I saw it on YouTube.
It's a typical weather seduction.
I usually walk to school.
Draw a picture.
I can do it for her, unlike you.

You're sick, you need to rest.
The bear has a short tail.
It surprised him.
I hate him, too.
We met before school.

I shouldn't have bought it.
What else do you need?
They don't look happy.
This is a real man.
I don't trust you.
I'm Ukrainian.
Can I go home?
Tom and Mary couldn't help me do it.
It's time to go.
Tom ran as fast as he could.
I can't open the door.
When did it start?
I love fries.
He's almost always in the hospital.
I just moved on.
Who are you, and what are you doing here?
Thank you for last night.
Tom says he's got a tenor.
Don't listen to him, he's talking nonsense.
Only the slaves spit on the ground.
Tom, could you stand up?
I don't even have a job.
What are you going to use this for?
Tom lost a man a few months ago.
I'm a little tired.
You have to help me find Tom.
Tom heard Mary scream.
Take off the cap.
There's no point in regretting it now.

I don't want to get my hands dirty.
I have a strong fever.
Tom's plan didn't go anywhere.

How are you, Mrs Jones?
I'm the only one who was supposed to do it.
I have a lot of credit cards.
I'm angry with Tom.
I'll sue you.
Put her in here.

He showed me his album.
Wouldn't you rather do that to Tom?
Who was running?
I hate my neighbors.
Who can explain it to me?
I'm in love with Tom's friend.
Am I early?
This looks serious.
Red is not your color.
I'm not sure if Tom will do it.
Tom left first.
Are you angry with Tom?
Mary lacks common sense.
I don't go to school on Sunday.
Tom's dog bit Mary's hand.
Have you bought Christmas gifts yet?
I gave him my address.
I woke up early enough to hit the first train.
Don't jump!
Whoever wants peace is preparing for war.

Of course he knows the answer.
It's just a dream.
Is it still here?
He's mean to her.
I just want to rest.
I hope you have an alibi.
I hate journalists.
Tom's not in town again.

We can win this war.
Thank you, it's okay.

What did you do with my pen?
Mary knows the police are looking for her.
I told Tom the joke.
Can we come, too?
You're doctors.
How do you like this place?
I like your coffee.
Tom's awake.
How much for one night?
I'm half as old as you.
Mary's like my own daughter.
It wasn't Tom, it was Mary.
This is fixed.
You're too nervous.
Have you ever seen this logo?
Tom was in his room at the same time and studied.
Tom said she didn't think that Mary actually liked doing it herself.
I know it's easy for you.
Put that sticker in your suitcase.
I thought you said you were the only child in the family.
I have a few French books.

Nobody cares what you think.
They voted.
I refuse to talk to you!
It's red.
I liked talking to him at the party.
None of what I did didn't help.
You're absolutely right.
The thopter and the girl sit on the fence.
I yelled.
This box is a bit heavy.
They're from Sweden.
They sent me to save you.
Tom knows.
Tom is used to it.
Tom works all night.
She's not always happy.
I'm sure Tom will do whatever Mary asks him to do.
They're good.
Do you have a subway map?
I'm not different from any other mother.
I underestimated the enemy's power.
What floor are we on?
Tom's starting to get nervous.
Tom can wait here.
My brother lives in Boston.
I always liked him.
What a strange life!
You can do whatever you want.
Sorry, I forgot.
Unfortunately, she already has a constant lover.
I bought each of them a gift.
Someone's calling.
When does this end?
Tom was a spy.
I didn't know you had a car.
She's listening to him.
Soup's too hot.
He fell on the ground.
You're always late.
Can he come tomorrow?
This is my final offer.

Let's talk about what Tom did first.
We'll wait here.
I know Tom's gonna tell you the truth.
I'm sure that's why I'm going to love it.
Are you in charge or against the abortion?
It works.
Let's try to do that with Tom.
Which of the dogs is yours?
Don't underestimate yourself, Tom.
Tom pressed the button, but nothing happened.
Sweet dreams, Shawn.
We have to do it ourselves.
Where are my credit cards?
I broke a leg.

It's a critical question.
Thank you for the information.
Tom's very smart, right?

I'd like you to speak French.
This is very personal.

You don't have to be nervous about that kind of thing.
You bastard.
Is that you?
Please call a doctor!
I'm too busy to go.
Find someone else.
Do you have a professional experience?
Is that the only solution?
They're not sure what they did wrong.
It's going to be very difficult to do.

I'm sure you'll find a good job.
You're skinny.
Tom doesn't trust the police.
Maybe this world is hell of another planet.

I don't think Tom knows someone who can do it.
I'm a teacher.
You played nice, didn't you?
I was born in 1997 in Osaka.

She dumped him.
Tom's safe.
I finally got driver's license.
I'm not a student.
That's why Mary was sorry.
I'm just looking at the news right now.
Tom checks the phone all the time.
How's the wife?
You're absolutely right.
Tom's not rich, but Mary's rich.

I heard you kissed Tom.
Let's go!
Maybe I was wrong.
Tom and Mary are back from Australia.
Do you understand French?
I bought it that week.
Apparently Tom doesn't speak to Mary.
I have to leave tomorrow morning.
I knew we could find you.
Mary likes girls.
Do you have anything else?

You don't have to hurry.
What's the guy's name?
I always get up about half past eight.
Did I invite you?
That's what Tom did after all.
I'm tired of playing.
Are you French or English?
He turned over the horn.
Just keep on doing what you're doing.
You made three mistakes.
There are no rules, but there are some exceptions.
Tom said when did he come?
What animal is a little thing?
I knew it was over.
I doubt Tom really meant what he said.
I said I'd try.
Tom took care of his sick father.
I'll do whatever I want.
I called Tom's parents.
Tell him I'm exhausted.
I thought Tom wouldn't do that.
How much money do you want?
Tom's changed.
I don't get joy from traveling in large groups.
Tom doesn't care about anything.
Forgive me, please.
What's in your backpack?
We have proof this time.
My throat hurts.
I like to finish what I'm starting.
We have to do this more often.
Hey, how are you?
I won't eat it.
We hoped rain would stop till lunch.

I don't have to tell you what it is, do I?
Just listen to us.
Good luck.
I'm the best.
I was amazed at how Tom did it.
Tom speaks French.
Aren't you ready to help us?
I doubt the new offer will be accepted.
Get her out.
How far are we from Boston?
That's what we thought we were going big.
We don't want that wrong.
Can I try?
I hate dancing.
- Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah.

Why did Tom go to the hospital?
Do you know any cheap hotel around here?
Have some cake.

There's nothing you can do without effort.
You want to know how?
Do you like Chinese food?
That's why Tom went to Boston.
He retired at age 65.
I lost my pen.
I'll work on it.
I was in the meeting yesterday.
Layla's late.
I wonder if tom once asked Mary why she did it.
I'll be in Boston for a few days.
I already did.
I stayed after school to help clean up the classroom.
Everyone wants something.
Tom has green eyes?
I always forget the names of people.
Why are you asking me?
I'm just looking.
Tom said he didn't care if he won or he won.
You speak good French?
You really don't have to do this.
I think Tom's in Boston right now.
I was scared.
I can read English.
Tom helped me wash my car.
This is our first Christmas here in Australia.
I look after my grandfather.
I'm going to leave at 10: 00 in the morning.
Did you come by the train?
You're not as young as Tom.
He's slowly recovered from disease.
In Rome, like the Romans.
He saw the expression of surprise on my face.
Hurry up and you'll be able to drive.

I ask myself if that's why you can trust me.
What's gotten into her?
Are you drinking?
I'm pissed.
When did he arrive?

Cats catch mice.
You should go.

Oh, my God!
Don't come in, I'm naked.
Are you planning on doing this somehow?

Mary said she wasn't sick.
If you want.
We have suppliers.
My unbiased idea is that this is a terrible film.

Whatever you want.
I could change.
