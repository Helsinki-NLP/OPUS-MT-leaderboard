I can't confirm it.
Mary guarantees that.
I got on the wrong bus.
I refused this offer.
Mary has already done what she had to do.
I watched Tom.
Did you reserve the table?
Where did the money go?
My grandfather was a hero.
I don't like this one.
Use them all.
You were right.
I don't want you to die.
Turn off your cell phone, please.
I'm not rich.
I didn't think you'd understand.
Don't you recognize this man?
How about going on a picnic?
We couldn't buy concert tickets until we got money from our friends.
Tom called Mary this morning.
Maybe some other time.
Tom refused to let Mary in the house.
Tom isn't a very good tennis player.
I'm Palestinian.
I can't possibly do that by myself.
Tom needs you here.
We're out of oil.
What do you think they want?
People who live in a place cannot recognize the satisfaction of living in a village.
Mary has beautiful eyes.
She gave me a book for Christmas.
I want a cheeseburger, a Coke, and some fries.
She stole a camera.
Welcome to your new home!
There's a problem with my account.
Tom gladly agreed.
I think Tom is wrong.
You all right?
You may be the only one who can do that.
Who's wrong?
Your singing puts professional singers to shame.
You know Tom is lying.
I thought you were Tom.
I don't need a knife.
Oh, my God!
Tom is nosy.
It was big.
Tom knows Mary wasn't the one who did that.
Esther is a Jew.
I was bitten by a dog last week.
Do you want me to ask him?
Tom and I aren't afraid of Mary.
Try swimming!
You're lucky to have such a good job.
What are you holding in your hand?
We're busy.
It's dinner time.
Tom isn't likely to forget how to do that.
Are you drinking?
Will Tom be doing that with you?
Aren't you asleep?
The meeting began at five o'clock in the afternoon.
Mary said she likes doing that.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom knew Mary wasn't busy.
I've only been to Tokyo once.
I got the electricity bill.
What color is his sweater?
I bought a new car last week.
I'm sure Tom will be OK.
He cut his finger with a knife.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary so much.
I wonder why Tom was planning on doing that.
The presence of all members is compulsory.
Aren't you comfortable?
You underestimated them.
Your parents would be proud of you.
I was born in May.
I agree, too.
I'm lucky.
A small cup of coffee costs two euros.
I wonder if I can do that again.
We have to decide today.
Who do you plan to do that with?
We're happy with the decision.
That skirt is cheap.
I saw Tom kissing Mary.
He was standing at the door.
She wept bitterly.
Tom repented of his sins.
You always tell me that.
Is that Mary's husband?
Sami will find out.
A Witness who has seen everything is worth more than ten witnesses who have heard everything.
Guess who I am.
Tom went back to the hotel.
How easy is it to learn English?
I play tennis an hour a day.
Tom is done.
When I entered the room, she played the piano.
You're very nice.
Where are your manners?
They did not give up hope.
Tom threw an egg at Mary.
When do you expect to come?
Tom ironed his shirt.
Tom went to the library.
We should call the police.
Tom decided to leave early.
Did Tom tell you where the party is?
Mary is tall.
Why are you so surprised?
It's a chair.
Tom didn't want to wait.
She filled this vase with water.
Tom doesn't hate Mary.
All right, I'll bite.
I don't want any more.
Do you know what color she likes?
I think Tom won't be here today.
Tom opened the restaurant.
I have to keep trying.
I'm glad you're happy.
I envy your good health.
Yes, it would be a pleasure!
She began to play an old song.
Why do they speak French?
That's a lie.
There are no pyramids in Europe.
It'll be spring soon.
She speaks two foreign languages.
It's too much.
Tom says I'm very gullible.
Why are you telling me this?
Let's go back.
Tom isn't crazy.
Don't even think about it.
Tom is very annoying.
Are you afraid?
You ruined my life.
We need to come up with a secret language.
Do you plan to stay long?
When do you plan to go to Japan?
My children are at school.
I placed my suitcase.
I got out of the car.
Tom has a younger brother named John.
Is there something you want to buy?
I'm old.
I'm thinking about you.
I just did my job.
Where did all these cars come from?
I live in a giant bucket.
Squash salt in the wound.
She refused to speak English.
Tom didn't know where to look.
We managed to swim across the river.
He obviously loves you.
Why is Tom so popular?
Tom is younger than you are.
I'm a French teacher.
Tom is very open.
I'm hungry because I didn't eat lunch.
I don't blame anyone.
The plane took off at exactly nine o'clock.
Tom speaks French quite fluently.
John caught a tiger and shot two lions.
Don't worry, I'll check everything myself.
Tom wiped himself with a towel.
What happened to Tom?
It's a bracelet.
I have plenty of time.
Let yourself be happy.
She wants to wait until the wedding.
I was a little late.
I want facts.
She couldn't defend herself.
Tom is leaving Boston next month.
Careful. It's still hot.
Let's kiss.
Every year millions starve to death.
I wondered what Tom wanted.
The letter received a wrong address.
This is the last train.
Who will fight?
I found a meteorite.
I'm not happy at all.
Everything is fine.
They changed their religion.
I should be more careful.
I downloaded them.
Mary sold her car.
Thank you for your hospitality.
What does he plan?
You're the best!
Are you ever going to do that?
We were able to save them.
He is a strange person.
I just got my hair cut.
Mary said she'd never study French.
I think I'll buy a new car.
It's our fault.
You're so cute.
It'll cost about fifteen dollars.
I slammed the door.
His theory is worth considering.
We're ashamed of Tom.
Help came too late.
It's not a new problem.
The pillow is very uncomfortable.
I wrote these books myself.
She's a tennis player.
That's how Tom became famous.
You were having fun, weren't you?
You were singing.
I did everything flawlessly.
I like writing.
Kyoto is an exceptionally beautiful city.
I'm sixteen years old next month.
Do you think there's a chance that'll happen?
Deal with your dreams.
What time will your last class end?
I've come to say goodbye, Tom.
I like this dog.
I tried to contact her.
What does she have?
How was the exam?
Where was this book published?
Tom said he wasn't tired.
Tom and Mary are doing that.
We have to help Tom.
It rained all day.
I was upset about that.
Can I have your phone number?
You should stop.
Tom is going to go to Boston.
Who said you could do that?
Why did you buy a flower?
The clock is ten minutes behind.
Tom wants to become a doctor.
Speak softly.
During the day the sun shines, and at night the moon shines.
I got on it.
You were right before.
I hope Tom will help us.
You have the right to be happy.
What's your rating?
I'm having trouble with my boss.
It's a banana.
Tom will probably be punished for what he did.
Is Mary your girlfriend?
The fog enveloped London.
I'm very glad you're here, Tom.
Tom is weak.
I told Tom to come to Australia.
Do you usually travel abroad?
You must be flexible.
I believe you'll win.
She went to the airport to see him off.
Stand aside.
It's in the kitchen.
I'm begging you, don't be mad.
They won't tell us.
Work slowly.
Brazil's capital is Brasília.
What I really want is to sleep.
I still have to pay the phone bill.
Tom can cook.
That music makes him nervous.
What languages are spoken in America?
You deserve a rest.
These are fresh.
Tom's eyes are huge.
The rainbow has seven colors.
I think Tom shouldn't do that.
He is gloomy today.
I wish we could spend more time together.
Listen to his frank opinion.
Aren't you on duty tonight?
Tom never had to study too much.
How's your wife, Tom?
I accept your offer.
Bill has many friends.
That would be unfair.
Either you or Jane should go there.
If I were you, I'd ignore it.
Tom is going to be here right now.
These are the most expensive shoes I've ever seen.
It's a Greek name.
Do you think I'm joking?
I was very tired today.
I'm truthful.
Happiness is not to possess many things.
The news spread all over Japan.
Tom showed the mountain side.
The taxi's here.
I heard him come downstairs.
That's mine. Give it back.
How odd!
Can you read Cyrillic?
I know Tom quite well.
I shouldn't have come here.
Tom is tidy, isn't he?
I wish you weren't such a fucking asshole.
Did Tom give you anything for me?
I could never do that without your help.
I always have coffee and toast for breakfast.
I'm hungry because I didn't eat breakfast.
I'm the best.
How was your test?
Can I pay later?
Did that just happen?
Mary didn't take an umbrella with her.
Did you hear me?
To tell the truth, I lied.
I'm going to bed!
He doesn't like eggs.
I found the money.
I don't understand why he did it.
They're all tourists.
Can you lend me a tweezer?
It's your life.
Tom said he was thirsty.
I wonder whether or not Tom has ever asked Mary why she didn't do that.
Patrick can't write properly.
I was too shy.
I went into details.
Tom said he didn't want to do that.
Let's go to the aquarium.
Do you know what's causing the problem?
Where is Boston?
I need your opinion.
Don't worry. She doesn't understand German.
Is she hiding something?
Tom said he was interested.
I have a good appetite today.
We're comfortable in our new house.
There are only two things in the world that are infinite, the universe and human folly, and I can't be sure about the first.
She said, "I'm very happy."
It's interesting to talk to Tom.
You reap what you sow.
What are you staring at?
Could we go faster? I'm late.
We're not just football players.
All the meat's gone bad.
I was born like that.
I ran a race with Tom.
He came home late at night.
Britain's National Health Service has updated recommendations for the coronation today.
Grab the rope.
Tom and I drink the same thing.
He couldn't fight the desire to smoke another cigarette.
There's a secret passage.
I don't want to argue with you.
Let me in.
She's unconscious.
I thought Tom would refuse to do that.
I love you.
Which floor do you live on?
Tom was a little confused.
He signed the check.
Hi, how are you?
The password is "Muiriel."
Did you hear what Tom said?
Tom is reading novels.
Take the garbage out.
You're my friend.
He has two cars.
They realized.
No problem!
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
May I borrow your scissors?
Thank her for her help.

What are you doing about it?
I meet her demands.
Forget about this sad event.
Please take this away.

This is my wife, Edith.
This student is American.
The cloud is gray.

I wonder whether or not Tom has told Mary she has to do that.
All dogs are animals, but that doesn't mean all animals are dogs.
Those who can think of only one way to write a word obviously lack imagination.
I'm sure of his success.
Tom wasn't the one who did that.
Where's the nearest metro station?
Tom escaped through the window.
You're not hiding anything?
How are you?
I didn't know that was going to happen.
I have many friends.
You can do that right now.
There's no speed limit.
Tom blushed a little.
That's what you have to do.
I should probably spend some time with Tom.

It's a Christmas tree ornament.
You said it was important.
Can you help me?
Tom said he hopes Mary can win.
I think they're students.
I'm just saying you did a good job.
I think you've said enough.
I'm a client.
I'm very greedy.
You're crazy.
Tom won't bother Mary anymore.
Answer right away.
I suspected that Tom was homesick.
Tom hasn't done that since last year.
Are you done complaining?
Aren't you Mary's husband?
Do they speak English?
Nobody saw Tom.
The police continued their investigation.
I think I know what Tom would've done.

What are you going to do today?
I love this game.
How's Emily?

The girl was afraid of her own shadow.
You aren't like the others.
I'm innocent.
Did you go out last night?

That's much worse.
I'm tipsy.
You didn't waste any time.
Who knows when Tom will do that?

Tom can drive.
I read novels at random.
I was going to tell Tom, but I forgot.

Does it matter?
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Tom may not even make the team.
I wonder whether or not Tom can be trusted.
What happened to her?
Do you drink?
I got angry.
When did he arrive?
Where's your teddy bear?
How's it going, Tom?
Maybe this year we'll finally win Eurovision.
Where could Tom do that?
I think you're wrong.
I'm attentive.
Do you have a passport?
I managed to forget my wallet.
Cats catch mice.
You're allowed to go.

Where's Tom going?
I'll call them myself.
I made Tom do that.
Why in the world would Tom want to do that?
Birds can see the earth's magnetic field with their eyes.
Do you need a car?
It's Tom's signature.
What really happened here?
Oh, my God!
Don't come in! I'm naked.
Are you planning on doing that sometime?
Am I making myself clear?
I'm free this afternoon.
Tom will probably be punished for doing that.
In spite of everything, Tom is happy.
There's no need to hurry.
Are you happy?
I didn't believe him at first.
The phone is currently out of order.
Tom is with his friends.
What were we afraid of?
Please come in!
Get inside.
Tom may get fined if he does that.
I know you aren't stupid.
I'm the strongest.
It's really stupid.
Tom is my older brother.
Tom told Mary he saw John in January.
You always get up early, don't you?

Are you Japanese?

When did you come to China?
Do you approve of what Tom is doing?

It's nice to meet you, Tom.
This is the perfect opportunity!
