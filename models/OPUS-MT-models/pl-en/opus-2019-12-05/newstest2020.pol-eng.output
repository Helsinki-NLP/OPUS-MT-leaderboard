Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in white robe
He's a charismatic.
At his Mass for the release and healing of the multitude.
He was a dozen years old when things started to happen in his life that were inexplicable.
Today, through a Franciscan, others experience it.
At the mass celebrated by Fr. Witko for release and healing bring down the crowds
Once, the parents of a seven-month-old child came to him and had a hole in his heart that was 7.5 mm.
It was supposed to be operated on.
Father Joseph Witko prayed over him.
The same day the boy was taken to the hospital for surgery.
The astonished doctors said, "The operation is not needed, the loss is only 1.5 mm."
My parents cried out of happiness.
After another Franciscan prayer, the hole disappeared completely.
The spiritual extraordinary actions of the Creator began to experience already as a teenager.
In dreams, purgatory souls came to him asking for help.
I was awakened at night and urged to pray for the dead and for those who died at the time, "he mentions.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what was happening to a man who committed a mortal sin.
"My body began to change.
I lost human qualities and began to look like an animal, "he says.
The invisible force carried him up, couldn't get his voice out.
He felt he was lost.
Then God showed him salvation.
"Immersed in the waters of the river symbolizing baptism, I was freed and returned to human form..." he says.
He didn't tell anyone about these strange experiences.
He had a calling in him.
He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.
In his sermons, he didn't just want to talk about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience him alive.
Members of the Charismatic Community of Reconstruction in the Holy Spirit
There are many people who are hoping to get rid of the disease in the mass about the healing performed by Father Witko.
However, the spiritual emphasizes that their main goal is spiritual healing, not physical healing.
Kolping's first defeat FRAC Jarosław
Today (26 September) in the afternoon the team of Kolping FRAC was honored by the current Polish champion Darts Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki as part of the 3rd round of the Lotto Superleague of Table Tennis.
The Jaroslavians have little chance of winning against the league's suverens in the personal chart they presented with the bulwarks.
He did a good job of showing it to Darts Bogoria.
The team is still missing, the leader of the team, Chen Jingqi.
Perhaps with him, the Jaroslavians would reach for the third consecutive triumph of the new season.
I don't think the young Asian Qiyao Han has yet grown up to win with dozens like the Greek Panagiotis Gionis and the Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most forward-looking Poles, or Mark Badowski.
The player from Hellady was the biggest star of the match in the MOSIR hall at Sikorski Street in Jarosław.
Both in battle with Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei was a class of his own.
After three duels, Kolping FRAC led 2-1.
Kou Lei must have played Mark Badowski, and Daniel Górak after an exciting five-seater battle - Pavel Siruck.
But then it got worse.
Gionis didn't give Lea a chance.
You could still hope to win for two points, but Qiyao Han didn't match Badowski.
There will be no more tests for seniors.
Why?
According to the announcement by Rafal Trzaskowski, a free prevention programme for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not received the approval of the Ministry of Health and its subordinate Agency for the Protection of Medical Technologies and Tariffs.
In the explanatory memorandum, the agency explained that the target group had been poorly selected.
"These effects may even result in the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to increasing difficulties in access to NFZ services and may have a negative impact on the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with false positive research results," has been written.
The decision of the Ministry is not understood by the president of the capital.
"The money is ours, we predicted it.
Only the government is afraid that if people get tested, then they'll go to the doctor, which is absurd, because it's about getting prevention done faster.
All specialists know that it helps when it comes to the burden on the health system, because it helps to detect diseases quickly and to take a sound approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand, "said Rafał Trzaskowski.
"I find it hard to imagine that experts say," Let's not get tested, because there will be longer lines at the doctor's office, and if such specialists advise the government, I am not surprised that this is the state of health, "added PO policy.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all existing agreements
Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas announced on Thursday at the session of the UN General Assembly that he would break all agreements with Israel if the future government of this country tried to meet Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement of the annexation of occupied Palestinian lands.
"If the future government of Israel, which will rise, proceed to implement this plan, we will cancel all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all the commitments made," he said.
"We will reject the whole plan completely and completely," he threatened with pressure Abbas.
"It is our duty to defend all our rights with all possible means - the few consequences - by fully engaging in the application of international law and the fight against terrorism," said the President of the Palestinian Authority, who had already made similar declarations in July.
Netanyahu, the former Israeli Prime Minister, was re-elected after the elections of 17 September.
A week before the elections, he announced that if he won, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and intend to include in Israel all Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank.
In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, led by Jaser Arafat, signed a series of peace agreements that the United States was patrolling.
84-year-old Abbas also promised to hold general elections on Palestinian soil during the UN General Assembly.
The last one took place in 2006.
"When I return to the country, I will convene local elections in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, and all those who oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community," declared the Palestinian President solemnly.
Abbas also defended in his speech the rights of Palestine, as a permanent observer in the United Nations, to exercise the powers of "full members of the United Nations and all its bodies and institutions."
The Palestinian leader ended his speech with a call to the international community to "force Israel to comply with all the provisions of the United Nations."
The Israeli ambassador, Danny Danon, responded briefly to Abbas' speech saying that the Palestinian leader "prefers to focus in the UN on the efforts of the Palestinian Authority against Israel, rather than to fight against the calls for terrorism in the Autonomous Union under its leadership."
However, Danon, as reported by the agencies, did not refer to the annexation of occupied Palestinian lands announced by Netanyahu.
The paramedics want defibrillators at sensitive points.
The story from the border crossing shows that an AED automatic defibrillator can save lives.
The Provincial Emergency Station in Przemyśl wants such devices to be at the critical points of the city.
For their attitude, the officers received congratulation diplomas from the Provincial Emergency Service in Przemyśl.
Aplicant Daniel Cyrnek, senior applicant Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek Wójcik are officers of the Podkarpackie Tax Office in Przemyśl.
On August 28, they served at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medica. An officer of the Customs and Tax Service noticed a man lying unconscious in the pedestrian zone.
A Chinese activist died in custody as a result of torture.
He wanted to exercise the rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
On 23 September, the secretary of the Communist Party from her native village called Cao Shuxia, the wife of an activist, to inform her that her husband had just died in a military hospital in Hengyang.
Which was cause of death - he didn't reveal.
In Cao's morgue, she saw her husband's body massacred, unrecognizable.
"His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were covered in blood," says the woman.
"They wouldn't let me take my cell phone with them, and there were a lot of cops around who wouldn't get close to Wang."
The police insisted that she sign a statement that her husband was ill and died of an "unfortunate accident."
PLN 105 million for video game companies from the National Centre for Research and Development
Almost PLN 105 million of funding will go to companies in the gaming industry, which create innovative solutions.
The National Centre for Research and Development announced the results of the 3rd edition of the GameINN programme on Friday.
Among the nearly 30 projects supported by NCBR were the development of a platform for the development of field games based on the AR game engine, which creates a real world map with a user-friendly application; a test and training platform for the verification of practical skills in the workplace and professional development using VR and AI technologies; an innovative game that simulates the management of real production processes using an innovative virtual world-to-real interaction model using the 4.0 industry concept - is set out in the NCBR message sent on Friday, PAP.
The aim of the GameINN sector programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game industry in the global market by 2023.
According to NCBR, the Polish video game sector is already growing at a rate of 10% per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 was PLN 1.85 billion, while the forecast for 2019 was PLN 2.23 billion.
"The specially prepared GameINN research agenda and the already 300 million PLN support for entrepreneurs under this sectoral programme are an important boost for further dynamic growth of the Polish gamedev," we read in the communication.
The video game industry is an excellent example of effective exploitation of the potential we have in Poland.
"The government's incentives for innovative entrepreneurs, such as R & amp; D incentives, skills improvement programmes, IP box and NCBR support programmes drive innovative business activities and allow them to compete more effectively in a highly competitive market," says the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Science and Higher Education, Jarosław Gowin, cited in the Communication.
The head of the science department points out that the money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of project funding, but also stays in their pockets - three quarters of more entrepreneurs benefited from the R & amp; D reduction in 2018 than a year earlier.
"The deductible costs for R & D activities amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which resulted in over PLN 300 million savings for companies benefiting from this reduction.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by NCBR in the three editions of GameINN, "stressed the Deputy Prime Minister.
The director of NCBR dr inż. Wojciech Kamieniecki recalls that 78 innovative projects have been awarded in the previous two co-financing competitions with a total value of more than PLN 211.2 million.
The huge interest in the third competition and the diversity of applications show that the video game industry has ideas and competences to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.
"It is particularly welcome that, as in previous editions, the selected projects include projects for solutions that serve not only entertainment but also industry 4.0," he adds.
In the third GameINN competition for funding of up to PLN 20 million, entrepreneurs, business consortia and business consortia with scientific units could apply.
The NCBR received 87 applications for the total amount of funding of approximately PLN 317 million.
The budget of the competition at the time of the announcement was PLN 100 million, but was increased, so 27 projects were awarded almost PLN 105 million in co-financing.
Detailed information on the results of the 3rd GameINN competition is available at ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN Sector Programme is implemented under the Intelligent Development Operational Programme.
NCBR launched the programme in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated with the Polish Games Agreement, including such companies as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Blooper Team and 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga confessed to stealing Kasper Dolberg's watch
The incident occurred on September 16th.
Dolberg, who came from Ajaksu Amsterdam to Nice at the end of August, realized after training that his watch had disappeared from the locker room.
Not just any, it's worth 70,000 euros.
The angry Dane didn't show up for class the next day, explaining his stomach problems.
The case was a mystery from the beginning.
Football players in the locker room have private safes at their disposal, and the club area is monitored.
According to the AFP, Diba-Fadig finally confessed to the theft.
The 18-year-old has already apologized to Dolberg and his other teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised the Danish to return the money for his watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most forward-looking young generation footballers in France.
He went to Nice as a 13-year-old to make his first debut three years later.
He played seven games this season.
He recently signed a professional contract, but, as the newspaper "L'Equipe" said, the club will probably solve it with immediate effect.
For now, he has initiated disciplinary action against his player.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on this.
Make sure you wash your hands right.
We all know that you have to wash them (e.g. when you come home or before a meal).
But not everyone knows that to actually get rid of germs, you have to do it the right way.
This is especially important now that the autumn infections are coming.
It takes at least 30-40 seconds for the washing to remove the dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands.
Yet most of us wash them less.
Just warm water and simple soap - it is not true that it has to be antibacterial (many doctors even advise against it).
By washing, we rub not only the underpants and the tops of the hands, but also: the tips of the fingers (joined or individually) - rub them with circular movements on the inside of the other hand, the spaces between the fingers (interweave your hands, rubbing your fingers against each other), thumbs - each thumb embraces the other hand and in such a embrace we spin it a moment to the right and left.
In an emergency situation (when you cannot wash your hands) we should wipe your hands with a wet handkerchief and then use antibacterial gel (in drugstores, from 5 zł).
After using the public toilet, do not touch the handle or the door (the recommendation of the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate) with your hands washed.
Open them through the paper towel.
The Iranian President says he rejected the proposal to talk to the US, Donald Trump denies it.
Tehran did not engage with the US at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, despite the American offer to lift sanctions, "said Iranian President Hasan Rowhani on Friday.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, commented that it was the Iranian party that asked for the removal of the restrictions, which he refused.
According to Iranian President Hasan Rowhani, the Americans have proposed the abolition of all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiations on a new international agreement.
It would regulate both Iran's nuclear programme and the ballistic missile programme.
Rowhani: Iran will not engage in talks in the atmosphere of maximum pressure
The President of Iran has stated that he has refused to engage in these talks because of the 'toxic atmosphere'.
He stated that he had met with American diplomats because he had given in to the orders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
However, he stressed that Iran would not engage in talks in the atmosphere of 'maximum pressure'.
"And even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in 5 + 1 format, no one can predict what the final result will be," said Rowhani.
The day before, the Iranian leader said that he did not rule out talks with the US and that the European parties to the nuclear agreement accused the American sanctions on Iran.
He added that sanctions imposed on Iran following the US withdrawal from the nuclear agreement "are a prerequisite that does not allow" for dialogue.
If we can lift this precondition and if America can lift sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America, "he declared.
He added that he did not exclude a meeting with the President of the United States Donald Trump, even though he did not agree to such a conversation during the United Nations General Assembly during the past week.
Trump: "Iran asked, I said no"
Donald Trump tweeted that he rejected the Iranian request.
"Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course, I said no to the president of the United States.
Voltage with atomic agreement in the background
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to ease the tensions between Washington and Tehran in some form to save the 2015 Iran agreement, which they were signatories to.
It stated that, in exchange for the abolition of economic sanctions, Iran would abandon its nuclear weapons programme and that the nuclear sector would be placed under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the withdrawal of the US from the agreement in May 2015, the other signatories have often confirmed that they want to maintain the agreement in force.
It hasn't worked out yet.
Washington is using the tactics of exerting maximum pressure on Iran, and sanctions also include a full embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran has announced that if it does not receive an export licence for the raw material, it will limit its obligations under the agreement every 60 days.

The judge of the Voivodeship Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of the hater Emilia, who, according to her words and screenshots from WhatsAppa, participated in the stalking against the judges, was reinstated by the NSA on Wednesday.
Reason: no disciplinary action has been brought against him, so there is no reason to maintain the order of WSA President Wojciech Mazur to remove him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary spokesperson at the NSA, opened an investigation into Shmydt at the end of August, but it has not yet turned into a case against him.
Although the NSA, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, has to deal with the decision of the President of the WSA within one month of its adoption.
In this situation, a judge who spoke publicly about his wife's mental problems in order to discredit her, who, because of suspected involvement in the Haitheran group, was removed from the office of the KRS, will return to judgment and will be issuing judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.
Judge Shmydt denies his involvement in the Haitian group.
He claims there's no evidence of that except for the fake screenshots and the words of his wife he's divorcing.
That's exactly what the other judges associated with "the caste" claim: they're all innocent, there's no evidence.
And it's quite possible that they'll stand up for themselves.
Because the DA didn't lift a finger to secure the evidence from their electronic media, and he's not talking about the contents of Emilia Shmydt's phone, which she stopped in June on another case.
The police did not lift a finger to secure the devices of the people who were persecuted by Judge Waldemar Zurerek in the report of February.
There's no evidence - there's no case of Shmydt, there's no case of "the caste."
Also, there is no case of the head of the NIK Marian Banasia for renting a tenement to the suteners and hiding the income.
CBA's checking his assets.
And he'll check when he does.
The Committee on the Ethics of the Sejm will not take care of Banasie, because the Sejm is suspended (but the Committee on State Control has somehow come together to make a curiosious decision to dismiss Banasie's alternates and to appoint his lawyer as acting minister, although the law does not provide for such a bizarre combination).
The whole thing reminds me of a movie novel, American, I think, about how his wife comes home and finds her husband in bed with her lover.
She's so amazed and devastated, she can't say a word.
She's standing at the door speechless, while her lover jumps out of bed, dresses up and leaves.
And the husband makes the bed.
When the wife gets her voice back and screams, "What is this?"
Who is this woman?
My husband calmly asks, "What woman, darling?"
It's just that there's a parody of the state in the matter of "the caste" or Banasia.
And that's not funny at all.

Kamila Lićwinko in the final jump rise
Previously returning to the competition this season after the maternity break, the bronze medalist of the 2017 World Cup, beat 1.85 and 1.89 in the first attempt and 1.92 in the second attempt.
1.94 was only achieved in the third approach.

Kornel Morawiecki is in a severe hospital
He went to the hospital, and the doctors call his condition heavy.
He's conscious and conscious.
"We believe he's gonna make it, that he's gonna win again.
We are all praying for him to recover, "said the anonymous close person Kornel Morawiecki in a conversation with the journalists" Super Expressu. "
In the upcoming elections, the Prime Minister's father is running for the Senate.
"I am kept alive by my closest family and politics," said Kornel Morawiecki in an interview he gave to journalists two weeks ago "Super Express."
In January, "Super Express" reported that the 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki went to the Military Hospital in Wrocław.
"I had strange, disturbing symptoms, and I went to the hospital.
Turns out I have jaundice.
But the worst was before me.
When the CT scan was performed, it was found that I had a pancreatic tumor, "said the Prime Minister's father.
A few days later, Kornel Morawiecki underwent major surgery at the MSWiA hospital in Warsaw.
As Morawiecki told us, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain, Father Zbigniew Kras, to the hospital.
The surgery lasted about three hours and went well.
"I know a lot of people prayed for me, and I thank you very much.
Luckily, I don't have any metastases.
I don't know if I'm going to have chemo yet.
I turn myself in to specialist doctors who are rather optimistic.
So far, after this heavy surgery, I have to go back to some kind of utility.
I hope everything will be all right, "said Kornel Morawiecki in January in his interview with the" SE. "
"If I had been tested too late, the situation would have been tragic, and I would have said goodbye to that corpse," he added.

The power of the Olava jumps.
The title of the relationship with amateur sports competitions, played on Sunday afternoon on September 15 on the hypocrisy at Oleandra Street in Oława, can be confusing for some.
The way to true power is far, but that is what one type of horse rivalry is called...
The competition of the power of the jumps is to overcome by the rider and horse ever higher obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competition exceed up to two meters.
It is worth adding that the long-standing and still unbroken world record, established in 1949 by Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the horse "Huaso," is 247 cm.
So high in Oława, of course, no one jumped, but the result of the best local amazons of 135 cm also does not belong to the worst...
The competition organised by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other JKS activists "In the saddle," was a showcase part of the "Rainbow equestrian competition," which we write more widely about in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.
Eight amazons trained riding in the Oława JKS entered the competition.
Four were competing on ponies, and four were competing on big horses.
The first group was best served by Nikola Szoldra, riding the crazy "Sprinter."
This small but dynamic steerage began by overcoming obstacles spread 40 cm high and ended only at a station with a top beam 125 cm away from the ground.
However, he did not give up easily, and only after three further refusals was he removed from the competition by the jury.
The second place in the ponytail jumps was taken by Amelia Pawlak, who took the "Fams," and the third by Lena Borun on the "Harmider."
The youngest contestant, Inga Aksman, was ambitious, galloping and jumping through obstacles on the little mare "Carmen."
Even greater emotions were accompanied by the running amazons and viewers during the big horse competition.
The threat-looking falls were hit by Paulina Shewczyk, who was on the "Declaration" and by Anastasia Abramenko, who was on the "Lotka."
Fortunately, except for the minor beatings of the amazons and the horses, nothing bad happened, so they continued to participate in the competition.
A lot of problems with the introduction of the young mare "Wineta" to the parkur had her riding Veronica Łuczkiewicz.
It was either an assistant coach or another horse for the couple that went after a little crazy "Wineta."
After passing the obstacle from the parkur, she also drove a full circle, so at times in the boxes and in the stretches it was getting dangerous. "Everything is under control!," reassured Jan Sienkiewicz a little by these frightened spectators, especially the young ones.
From the beginning of the big horse competition, Marta Masalska, who was sitting in a beautiful "Whisky," was very good at the park.
This dignified mare, accompanied by an experienced amazon, followed the second approach in the final phase as the first to jump 135 cm and that was the best outcome of the competition at the moment.
After a while, however, the same height was counted by Paulina Szewczyk on the "Declaration," Veronika Łuczkiewicz on the "Vineta" and Anastasia Abramenko on the "Lotka."
For the decoration of the flo and for the reception of the prize in the form of equestrian equipment, all these players left together, and in the end together with the amazons on ponies in the Radecki March performed a spectacular honorary round, ending these interesting and exciting competitions.
Thanks
The equestrian sports club "In Siodle" warmly thanks the sponsors of the jump power contest during the 16th "Rainbow Equestrian Competition": the City Office in Oława, the Waterworks and Sewerage Plant in Oława, the District Starość and the company "Mustang."
Max Kolonko cuts off KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko
KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko is the name of the election committee under which political formation # R Revolution Mariusz Max Kolonka was to go to October parliamentary elections.
The revolution was aimed at young voters with right-wing views in particular.
Before the elections, Kolonko announced cooperation with Mark Jakubiak or Paul Kukiz, but none of these coalitions occurred, and KWW itself, the Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko, could not even collect enough signatures to put out letters in any constituency in Poland.
Now Kolonko tweeted that he had finished working with KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko.
"I'll be waiting for the W / W KWW to remove my name from the name.
I kindly ask you not to connect my person with the above-mentioned entity, "he added and announced that he would give more information shortly.
For now, it is not known whether the journalist will continue to act, or whether this is the end of the # R Revolution formation.
On July 4, American Independence Day, American journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko announced the formation of a new political formation - # R Revolution.
In recent years Kolonko has been famous for running the Max TV channel on YouTube, where he comments on events in Poland and the world.
"We've had enough of politicians, enough of your stupid games, enough of your amateur governments.
It is time for the government in the country to take over the nation and rule for the good of the nation, "said Kolonko.
The party's programme included, among other things, issues relating to the judiciary (it should be elected in the general elections), tax changes (equalisation of tax-free amounts for all), war reparations (in the form of military aid to the countries of the eastern NATO fleet, with particular attention to Poland), a referendum on gun possession, a reduction in the number of Members or the introduction of single-mandate constituencies.
A few days after the announcement of the new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko joined the talks with Mark Jakubiak.
At the end of July, Kolonko posted information on his social media profile suggesting that # R would join forces with the Kukiz '15 movement.
However, none of these coalitions ultimately happened.
UBS: Gold close to balance point
"The euro rate will continue in the coming months in the vicinity of the ceiling of PLN 4.35, which will be accompanied by a weak economic situation in global markets," announces Michael Bolliger from UBS Wealth Management.
"The expectations of maintaining a sound growth rate and a stable monetary policy are in favour of stabilising gold quotations at the current ceiling," says the specialist in his interview with Banker.pl.
In his view, despite the clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to increase its rates in an environment in which the vast majority of central banks mitigate their policies.
"While gold is properly valued - the euro quotations should be maintained in the coming months in the area of the ceiling of PLN 4.35 - so much less attractive are the Polish bonds.
Much more favourable profitability than Polish securities offer bonds from emerging markets, "says Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation to emerging markets in the company of UBS Wealth Management.
According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the economic downturn in the world.
"The global slowdown may be even worse, but there should not be a severe recession, but at the most, a decline in GDP dynamics slightly below zero," announced Michael Bolliger.
"Investors should be unbalanced by global actions that could be damaged by the lack of prospects for a solution to the US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trump's impeachment procedure and brexit.
Among the equity markets, Europe should behave least, "follows the latest letter to investors by the head manager of UBS Wealth Management Mark Haefele.
"Euro area shares should behave worse than US shares, because they are more vulnerable in conditions of increased uncertainty about global trade and fear of slowing down," we read in the document.
According to Michael Bolliger, after the stock market of the safest countries pushed the profitability of German 10-year-olds to less than 0.74%, it is still possible to deepen the decline in profitability.
However, the long-term viability of long-term, but only short-term, securities should no longer decline in the longer term by mitigating banks' monetary policy.
The Fed has the greatest scope for lowering its feet, which should lead to a weakening of the American currency over the next few years.
The long-term point of balance for euro quotations is the ceiling of USD 1.29, which would mean 19% of the potential to strengthen the single currency to the dollar.
We expect further reductions in Fed rates, which will result in a reduction in the differences in monetary policy in the world.
"To maintain the strength of the dollar in the long term may not allow current and budgetary deficits," announced Michael Bolliger.
Bundeswehra loses his weapon.
Confidential report from the German MON
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehr has recorded 39 weapons, 39 arms and 19 445 ammunition, as a result of a confidential report drawn up in the Ministry of Defence of the Federal Republic of Germany.
Press from the media group RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND) provided this information.
According to a document from the Parliamentary Office of the Secretary of State at MON Peter Tauber (CDU), two weapons, one piece of weapons and 3474 ammunition have been retraced to date.
Among the military equipment still missing are: six universal MG3 machine guns, 11 G3 automatic rifles, four G36 automatic rifles, six signal guns and two P8 pistols.
In addition, 30 barrels are missing for MG3 machine guns.
The situation was disturbed by the vice-president of the Left party, Martin Renner.
As she told RND journalists, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is "appalling."
All the more so, as a result of investigations carried out, only a small part of the lost equipment was found.
Martina Renner summed up the effects of these activities as a "lousy balance sheet."
She also criticised the fact that it did not show whether there was a weapon found during the investigation against Lieutenant Bundeswehr Franco A. In December 2017, the Federal Prosecutor's Office in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence threatening State security and of violating the provisions of the law governing access to firearms.
The officer was accused of preparing assassinations against the leading German politicians for extreme right-wing and racist reasons.
His "black list" of targets, which fell into the hands of the prosecution, included, among others, the then Minister of Justice Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, human rights defender and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung Foundation in Berlin.
Franco A. has illegally taken possession of four firearms, over 1000 ammunition and over 50 explosives.
The crying kids on the plane.
How do we avoid them?
There's a solution.
Japan Airlines has recently been using a function developed for people who are having a nightmare travelling with a crying child.
Through the website, the lines allow you to check the distribution of seats on the plane.
If you travel a child until you are two years old, the "child icon" appears on a specific seat reserved by parents or carers.
Thus, the person using the services of the carrier has the possibility to choose a place far from that occupied by the little one.
The BBC states that the lines have already reported the imperfections of this solution.
The "child icon" will not appear if the ticket has been booked by a third party or if there has been a change of aircraft at the last minute.
As expected, the idea was shared by Internet users.
Some Twitter users point out that travelling with crying children can be solved with noise-reducing headphones.
They're kids. We used to be kids.
"We must learn tolerance, because soon we will need a map of seats for breathing, drooling or drunkards," wrote user G Sundar.
Another Internet user noticed that he used to be disturbed by crying children on a plane, but he changed his mind when he became a parent himself.
There is also a lack of supporters of Japan Airlines' solution.
"Thank you for warning me about screaming children on a 13-hour journey," wrote Rahat Ahmed.
Majorca counts losses after the bankruptcy of the travel agency Thomas Cook
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not arrive in October on leave to Majorca as a result of the Thomas Cook travel agency declared bankrupt on Monday.
On Friday, a representative of the Autonomous Government of the Balearic Republic, Marc Pons, among the 25,000 vacationers who will not be able to take their leave in Majorca on October, there are also those who were to travel with companies indirectly associated with Thomas Cook, such as Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80% of the expected vacationers who, due to the bankruptcy of the British company, had to give up their rest in Majorca next month are German citizens and Scandinavian countries.
However, as Pons claims, since Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Balearic island during the November-April period, losses to the local economy will be reduced.
He revealed that the Balearic Government had already started negotiations with international operators on "entry into the market of Majorca" after the bankruptcy of the British operator.
According to the estimates of the Diario de Mallorca newspaper, more than 1000 people will lose their jobs due to the tourism crisis in Majorca in October.
About 800 are fired employees of Thomas Cook's Palma office.
Other people will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, together with the announcement of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook in many Majorca hotels, the property owners demanded that the guests pay an extra charge for the accommodation.
This situation has been experienced by several dozen tourists from Poland.
The Balearic Government estimates that by Thursday several dozen hotels in Majorca will cease to operate until at least the end of October in connection with the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook and the companies cooperating with him.
On the other hand, the Friday's Diario de Ibiza daily indicates that the majority of Ibiza hotels that worked with Thomas Cook do not intend to close facilities in the coming weeks.
The newspaper recalls that on this Balearic island, a British bankrupt co-operated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the autonomous Balearic authorities announced that they would ask the Spanish Government to support the region with EUR 100 million to cover the losses caused by the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook's travel agency.
They have revealed that the most affected tourists in this archipelago, some 36 000 people, are located in Majorca.
According to data from the Balearic Government, Thomas Cook owes local tourist companies, mainly hotel operators, some €5 million for the implementation of the July-September 2019 agreements.
FIFA ranking of women.
Poland still at 29th place, USA at the head
The women's representation of Poland occupies 29th place in the International Football Federation (FIFA) ranking published on Friday.
In the same position, the team of Coach Miłosz Stępiński was classified in the previous July compilation.
I don't know. I don't know.
How will it be in October?
The leaders were American women who recently defended the title of world champion.
The second place in the ranking was kept by the Germans and the third remained by the Dutch.
The Poles are preparing for the ME qualification.
They were supposed to start it off with the Cheesecks on September 3rd.
The day before the meeting, due to food poisoning, it was postponed by one year.
In this situation, the Polish will inaugurate their qualifications by meeting the Spanish women on 12 November in Lublin.
Before that, the "White and Red" will play two social games - on October 3 at the exit from Cyprus, and five days later in Kielce with Brazil.
The Polek rivals are represented by Spain, the Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
The winners of the groups and the three best teams from the second place will advance directly to the final tournament.
The remaining six teams from the second position will play in the barracks for the last three passes to the European Championship.
16 participants will be added to the host - England.
The men's representation of Poland in the September FIFA ranking fell from 20th to 22nd place.
"Rz": The smog crushed the government
"The effects of the Clean Air program are low, and coal furnaces will kick this winter as if nothing had happened," we read on the front page of today's "Rzeczpospolita."
"To date, 82 000 applications have been submitted under the Clean Air programme for funding totalling PLN 2 billion, of which 48 thousand decisions have been positive.
Accepted applications amount to more than PLN 915 million in total, "says" Rz, "citing data from the spokesperson of the Minister of the Environment.
As the newspaper points out, only part of the costs incurred are reimbursed from the program.
The result of the announced noise of the program is estimated as "modest."
Self-governments, quoted by "Rz," see failure of "Clean Air" in too much bureaucracy, among other things.
"The programme should be much simpler: electronic notification, sending invoices by post, possible random control of implementation.
This would improve the operation, "says the Mayor of Lidzbarka Warminski Jacek Wiśniowski.
The activists from the Polish smog alarm note that less than 1% of the target of replacing 3 million digging boilers was implemented in the first year of operation.
As the "Rz" points out, although the programme budget is PLN 103 billion per 10 years, which is PLN 10 billion per year, this amount is virtual.
"The budget of the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management for this year is only PLN 1.4 billion," we read.
Congress agrees on F-35 for Poland
Firefly: Now price negotiations
The US Congress agreed to sell Poland 32 state-of-the-art F-35 aircraft.
"This is one of the last steps before the contract, but not the end of our work," wrote Mariusz Błaszczak on Twitter.
"We will negotiate hard to achieve the best possible price," added the Polish Minister.
Contract for Polish F-35
The Polish Air Force has a target of 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters produced by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, the US Department of State agreed to sell them to Poland.
The Communication stresses that investment will support national security and foreign policy of the United States by improving the security of NATO's ally, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to information from the State Department, Poland is going to pay 6.5 billion dollars for fighters.
However, this is not the final price.
The Department of State indicated that the contract would also include the supply of spare parts and repair parts, training equipment, the provision of engineering, logistics and personnel services, and related elements of logistics support and programme and staff training.
Lockheed Martin F-35 fighters
The F-35 Lightning II fighter produced by Lockheed Martin is a single-seat and single-engine fifth-generation multi-purpose fighter.
The plane is capable of carrying out close support missions, bombing missions and typically hunting air combat tasks.
Thanks to stealth technology, the fighter is undetectable for short-range radar.
Recently, F-35 fighters bought Belgium as part of a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want to replace them with aging F-16.
The purchase of US combat aircraft is also to be considered by other US allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Gender dolls
The manufacturer Barbie has launched a series of sexually neutral dolls.
That's how he wants to fight stereotypes.
Barbie manufacturer has launched a series of sexually neutral dolls
Next to Barbie with different skin colors, figures or hairstyles, Mattel introduced sex-neutral dolls for sale.
Toys from the "Creative World" series wear wigs.
Children can therefore decide whether their Barbie should have short hair or long hair.
Their dressing room consists of both pants and dresses.
In the blink of an eye, dolls can become boys with girls and vice versa.
They are also available in different skin colors and with different clothes.
The emphasis is also given to gender characteristics - the gender dolls no longer have full lips, long eyelashes and a thin waist or, in Ken's case, wide arms.
The company believes that children do not like their dolls to have sex standards imposed, and some parents and feminists are convinced that toys made for a specific gender inhibit girls' ambitions and strengthen traditional stereotypes.
"New dolls will make all children feel free," announced Mattel.
The Barbie doll, which appeared on the market in 1959 in a swimsuit and high-heeled shoes, has been criticised in the past for promoting "unhealthy female stereotypes," such as, for example, unnatural body proportions.
The company has responded to criticism and has already placed on the market dolls of different skin colors as well as more rounded shapes.
There were also dolls in the hijab.
Zandberg: circle or club Together can have several Members
Zandberg was asked on the ZET radio how many candidates of his party could get to the Sejm from the lists of left-wing groups (KW SLD from which the letter was sent by candidates to the SLD Sejm, Spring and Left Together, running with the common logo "Left"), replied that this depends on the outcome of the committee.
"I believe that the result of the Left will be very good, because we feel that people are bound to hope that the Left is not only right, but also has strength," he pointed out.
According to Zandberg, the left may have 60-80 Members.
"This may mean that the circle or club together will have several Members.
But that depends on Polek and Poles.
I'm not going to guess and tell you how this is going to happen, "he said.
The question whether the Left together would have a separate circle, Zandberg replied: "We are agreed that we are diverse, and we will not pretend that this diversity does not exist.
I think that this diversity has been rewarded by the Poles because we have shown that we have been able to agree on a common programme when we differ. "
When asked whether the largest beneficiary of a joint start was the leader of the SLD Włodzimierz Czarzasta, Zandberg replied that he believed that the biggest beneficiaries were the centre left and left left.
In turn, given that the SLD would receive the entire subsidy, he said that "the purpose of the political party is to represent its constituents."
Zandberg has admitted that he will vote for himself in the elections to the Sejm.
In the case of the Senate elections, he said he was wondering.
"The offer is varied and there are candidates and candidates in this offer to whom my heart is closer, but there are also those to which my heart is further," he said.
"On the other hand, I will say very honestly and clearly that if I had been in Senate County 44, I would have taken an election certificate and voted in another district," I stressed politics.
"I wouldn't be tempted to vote for Minister Kazimierz Ujazdowski (candidate KO - PAP)," he added.
In this district, the leader of Polish Citizens Paul Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from the PIS run outside Ujazdowski.
Dakar: The largest mosque in West Africa has been opened
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday for the inauguration of a huge mosque, considered the largest in West Africa.
Muslims came by bus, car and foot to the Bopp district, where a new mosque could accommodate 30,000 believers.
The building was built by the Moride Brotherhood, which belongs to the ceiling stream of Islam, which dominates Senegal.
Work on the mosque began ten years ago in a wetland area of six hectares, passed on by the government.
The name of the mosque Massalikul Jinan ("Path to Paradise") comes from the title of Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the 19th century founder of the fraternity, worshipped by followers as a saint.
The mosque is covered with Carrarian marble and has five minarets.
The highest one is 78 meters.
The mosque in the middle will hold 15,000 faithful, and the second is likely to be on the outer splanade.
In the richly finished interiors you can admire the gilded dome, giant chandeliers and decorations handmade by workers from Morocco.
The builders claim that the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the building still has no comparison to the mosque in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca can accommodate 105 thousand faithful.
The construction of the mosque, which cost more than EUR 30 million, was financed by private donations.
The government, in addition to the land, funded lighting, sanitation and financed road works worth EUR 10.5 million.
Coach Smiley: Our problem is not Silesia, but ourselves.
The eight-league streak without the victory of the Crown footballer will try to break in a Friday's meeting with the vice-leader of the Silesia Exodus.
"Our problem is not roller skating, but ourselves, we must work on what we play," said Mirosław Smyła, the coach.
The last and so far the only victory in the league was recorded in the first round when they beat 1: 0 benjamins of the Częstochowa Cancer games on their way out.
Later, the Kielans recorded two ties and six losses, and lost 0: 1 on Tuesday to the Lubin Zone in the 1 / 32 final of the Polish Cup.
"I'm very optimistic that in the last seconds of the cup match, the footballers were fighting for the goal, trying to tie.
Their fall on the wall after the last whistle was not the result of a breakdown, it was the fall of anger, because they were so close, "said Smila.
As he pointed out, Silesia has very strong wings, which is why he will be allergic to playing in the sidelines.
"We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we are also looking at what we want to play," said the coach.
In a Friday's game in Korona there will certainly not be a pause for excess yellow cards of Ognjen Gnjatic, and there will also be a shortage of injured James Zubrowski and Michael Gardawski.
The building, on the other hand, is to apply in a cup match to several players who would like to play.
"We have a headache, and recently it seemed to be gone, and now it is," said Smila.
Crown Defender Daniel Strangely stressed that Silesia would not be an easy rival to break the eight league games in a row without winning, while in the extragrade anyone can win against anyone.
"We're a good team.
In recent weeks we may not show it on the field, but the moment will come, that we will win and we believe it will be on Friday, "said the footballer.
After nine queues of the Crown Expanse with a five-point prize, it occupies the 15th position.
Silesia has accumulated 12 more and ranks second.
The Friday game in Kielce will begin at 8: 30 p.m.
These trees can disappear completely from Europe.
"42% of the tree species in Europe are at risk," warns the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in the Red Book of European Trees published on Friday.
The list is headed by chestnuts and lambs.
IUCN, an organisation established in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered species of European trees for the first time.
It has been drawn up by experts who have come to the conclusion from the study that 42% of the 454 species of trees found in Europe (and elsewhere in the world) are "highly threatened."
Among the causes of the Red Paper is the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.
However, these trees and shrubs, which occur only or mainly on our continent, are most at risk.
As regards the typical European condition, 58% of the species are at risk from IUCN experts and 15%, i.e. 66 species of trees and shrubs, are at risk of extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Paper mentions errors in the exploitation of woodland, accelerated urbanisation, excessive logging and subsequent forest fires and changes in the European ecosystem.
According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, moss and lichens is also at great risk.
"The consequences of human activity lead to the gradual disappearance of European plant species and risk the extinction of important and underestimated varieties in Europe, which are the basis of European ecosystems and have an impact on the health of our planet," concluded the report by Luc Bas, who runs the IUCN European office.
Grzegorz Schetina: I do not promise 600 +
"Today, PIS wants to bribe Poles by offering them for freedom of distribution on credit, which will have to pay off future generations," says Grzegorz Schetina in an interview for "Rzeczpospolita."
In his opinion, "the whole policy of PIS is pic."
At the same time, the policy promises that "what is given will not be taken away."
The schematic assures me in his interview with Jack Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea to defeat the Law and Justice.
It's about mobilizing the electorate at the ballot boxes.
In his opinion, the opposition has more potential in this regard than the Kaczyński party.
"Today, conscious people who want to live in a normal state are more than the followers of the PIS, a party that has misused its proclaimed values, such as modesty, humility, transparency," says Schetina.
The leader of the Civic Coalition and the chairman of the Civic Platform also highlighted the basic objectives of the KO electoral programme.
"First of all, nothing that data will be received, but the direction for the future has to be set, because the PIS only deals with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, as you can see even after dramatically low investments," he said.
Secondly, it is about "mobilising the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work fairly - and those who are entrepreneurial."
Schetina explains that the KO program includes, among others, a project which will give the least-earning Poles more about 614 zloty per hand and more earners - also several hundred.
The politician also pointed out that he didn't want to race to distribution.
As he said, he'll do as much as he can, but he won't promise 600 +.
"I will never allow the Greek option, where the rulers have been bidding against the opposition to the distribution, until the financial collapse of the country has finally occurred," he stressed.
In his interview with "Rz," he also stated that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki were afraid to debate with him and Margaret Kidaja-Błonska.
"We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.
"The pride walks before the fall.
Kaczyński is a statesman like Banasz is crystal, "he added.
The PO leader also said that he had not yet decided whether he would apply for the Platform's leadership.
Argentina: Six dead Grand Condors
In the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, six large condor have been found dead, "says TVN24.
Specialists believe that human activity has contributed to their deaths.
The great condor has probably been poisoned to kill predators like cougars, foxes or wild dogs.
The animals could have eaten a toxic carcass.
Except for one young man, the rest of the dead condor was an adult.
"It is a great loss to the environment, because a condor must reach 10-15 years to become fertile and able to reproduce.
So we lose a protected species, a endangered species, "says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentinean environmental organisation.
"I think the use of toxic bait and poison not only puts this species at risk, but all other life forms, including human health," he adds.
"Rz": They want a jewel for the president
Work has begun to give the head of state a precious chain.
The idea was supported by the law firm Andrzej Duda - we read in "Rzeczpospolita."
As the newspaper explains, it is the golden chain of the Order of the White Eagle, a royal insignia officially known as an interwar jewel of the Republic.
This is probably the last time President Ignacy Mościcki used it.
"Rz" says that soon such a chain may be on Andrew Duda's shoulders.
The Senate Committee on Human Rights, the Law of Law and Petitions voted on Wednesday for a proposal to undertake a revision of the Order and Judgement Act in order to restore it.
The journal says that this is not the first attempt to restore this chain to the head of the state.
The Senate had already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it was lost in one vote.
This time, the work is quick.
At the beginning of August, the senators devoted a few minutes to this matter, considering that they would consult the President's Chancellery.
This one came in mid-September.
"I kindly inform you that the Polish President's Office does not comment on the position put forward in this petition," wrote Minister Andrzej Dera.
On Wednesday, the case was continued by the senate committee and again devoted little time to the case.
"The President's office responded briefly: it is in favour of bringing it back," said the head of the committee Robert Mamytov of the PIS, quoted by "Rz."
He made a request for legislative work, which the committee supported.
The police will teach the drivers how to drive through the intersection
The police action will be conducted, among other things, at the intersection between Ciepliński and Piłsudski.
Uniform action is somewhat linked to recent complaints by the city authorities about drivers not always able to behave properly at the intersection.
On Friday, September 27th, police officers begin in Rzeszów prevention activities "Crossing crossroads."
It is about eliminating obstacles to traffic: entering the intersection without the possibility of a slide, not following light signals or road signs.
"We often think that we are alone at the intersection, and in fact we are making life difficult for other drivers," said Marek Ustrobinski, vice president of the city a few days ago.
His words were expressed at the town hall press conference, at which the city authorities presented examples of the improper movement of cars at crossroads, which in effect creates traffic.
At that time, the president called on travellers to make sense on the road and, among other things, to move faster at the traffic lights or not to text while driving.
The subject was taken over by the Rzeszów police officers, who from today begin the action "Crossing crossroads."
What is it?
The aim of the action is to eliminate congestion at crossroads by drivers entering them without the possibility of continuing to drive.
It is a frequent offence that contributes to increasing obstacles to movement and creating traffic.
Threatened by a ticket of PLN 300 and 2 penal points.
In addition, uniforms will pay attention to non-compliance with traffic signs or traffic signs and incorrect parking in the intersection area.
They will also observe a lack of driving liquidity, late moving from the signals, slow crossing and leaving too much distance between vehicles.
What intersections will the activities be on?
M.in. na ul. Lisa-Kuli z ul. Jagiellońska; al. Cieplińskiego z al. Piłsudskiego; ul. Targowa z al. Piłsudskiego; Placu Centroniawitów z str. Dąbrowskiego; or ul. Hetmańskiego z al. Powstaniec Warszawa.
Such shares in the capital of Podkarpacia will be held on the following Fridays of October.
They checked out the waste disposal company from "Tchaikas."
"Officials of the Department of Environmental Protection of the Wołominski County and the District Inspection of Construction Supervision inspected the installation in Zielonka Municipality on Friday, where waste from the waste water treatment plant" Czajka "in Warsaw is disposed of," reported the spokesperson of the Wołominski Vołominski region Karol Szyszko.
Inspectors from the Volominskaya old age carried out an inspection at an establishment located in the forests of Zielonka municipality.
The private Department of Commerce and Transport "Dar-Trans," under the contract with the capital sewage treatment plant "Tchaikka" provides bed waste management services.
"An inspection of the installation was carried out, and the trader was asked to provide documentation related to his activities," said Szyszko.
He added that the post-audit report would be submitted to the Provincial Environmental Protection Inspectorate in Warsaw, among others.
The last inspection in "Dar-Trans" was carried out by the Voivodeship Environmental Protection Inspectorate in Warsaw during the period of 29 December 2015 - 11 February 2016.
It was then established that the company did not take samples, measurements and tests of groundwater and did not have the results of studies on stabilised municipal sewage sludge from the "Tchaka 'sewage treatment plant.
Following the inspection of VIA, Darius Saturday was called to stop violating the terms of the decision.
The DAR-TRANS Private Trade and Transport Plant Dariusz Sobota is one of the waste collection companies in the form of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the "Tchaka" treatment plant.
According to the decision to dispose of waste on the site, waste of up to 60,000 tonnes per year is processed in the forests near Zielonka.
The Warsaw Municipal Water Supply and Sewerage Company reported last Thursday that at the end of November and December 2018 STUOW was excluded from operation, which was related to damage to one of the combustion plant's equipment.
As reported by MPWiK, the monthly export cost is PLN 1.7 million (calculated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Wałęsa supported Margaret Kidara-Blonska.
"You have taken on a difficult task, you can count on my full support," said Lech Walesa on Friday to the Magorzata Kidawy-Błonska.
"Mr President, these are very important words to me," said the candidate of the Civic Coalition to the Prime Minister, the leader of the KO list in Warsaw.
The former President stressed that, as far as the situation in Poland is concerned, he is now "just a retired fan."
Małgorzata Kidawa-Błonska met with former President Lech Wałęsa in his office in the Gdansk European Solidarity Centre on Friday.
The son of Wałęsa, Jarosław, took part in a brief conversation behind closed doors.
"You have taken on a difficult task," he said after the meeting with Lech Walesa.
"You can count on my full support," he added.
"The problems before Poland are known to all of us.
That is why the great hope that you, as a woman, will deal with these problems, and all of us - those who love Poland - will support you as much as possible, "said the former President, addressing Kidawa-Błonska.
Very important words
Kidawa-Błonska thanked me for your support.
"Mr. President, these are very important words to me, because no one like you can talk about freedom, about the constitution and knows how important it is," she said.
"Let us show that you can make a different, wise policy, together, but according to the constitution, according to the law, according to the respect of others.
The Lord did so in his revolution, and we so want to change Poland, "said Kidawa-Błonska.
Retirement fan
Walesa, in his interview with the press, said he was now "just a retired fan."
"Of course, I'm looking into it.
I hope that we will reverse the course of events, that what was good, checked, (to that) we will return.
The tripartite power is the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are necessary.
And all of this has to be cleaned up, all of this has to be restored to normal action, and I believe that this time we will do it.
Because if we don't, we have a street criterion, "said Lech Walesa.
"That is why it is so important that Poles go to the elections, think about it and make their own decision.
And that's the most important thing, "added Kidawa-Błonska.
"Last chance for us to improve the situation in Poland with a card," answered the former president.
"We must rebuild the foundation."
When asked about the most important changes to be made in Poland, Kidawa-Błonska said: "The President has said very well.
We need to build a new foundation on which we can do all the other things.
Since the tripartite power does not exist, since the Constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and make it obvious and so that everyone knows otherwise Poland will not move forward. "

The Senate has decided on key laws
The Senate adopted without amendment the Act on the disclosure of the property of the families of the most important civil servants and of the flights of the most important persons in the country.
52 senators voted in favour of the amendment of the Law on the property of civil servants' families, without amendment, and 14 opposed, with three abstentions.
The senators therefore decided to reject the 12 amendments tabled by Senator PO Sławomir Rybicki during the debate on Wednesday.
According to him, the amendments were to "civilise" and limit the scope of the statement of information on the property situation of own children, children of the spouse, children adapted to cases where children remain in the common household with the person obliged to make a declaration.
The law on the disclosure of family assets of the most important civil servants, which was designed in the Prime Minister's office, was passed by the Sejm on 11 September.
The rules assume that, inter alia, the Prime Minister, Ministers, Members, Senators, Presidents: the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as those at the head of other state institutions, will be obliged to include in the declaration of property information on the personal assets of spouses, children and persons living together.
The Senate also did not propose amendments to the Act on the flights of the most important persons in the country.
It regulates which flights have HEAD status and who can be on board government aircraft with the most important people in the country.
The Act also specifies who is responsible for running the Central Flight Register.
55 senators voted for the bill without amendment, 12 against and four abstentions.
According to the bill, every president's flight will be "performed on an official mission."
The President's flights will be accompanied by family members and other persons invited by the President.
On the other hand, the official Prime Minister and Marshal of the Sejm and Senate will be flying only "to carry out tasks directly related to their function."
The Act also specifies the list of persons who can accompany the most important persons in the country during the flight.
Under the regulations, members of the delegation may be on board the aircraft - invited Members, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts; persons providing technical, medical or organisational support; and journalists.
According to the Act, if there is any doubt regarding the flights of the Marshal of the Sejm and the Senate, the Head of the KPRM will request their clarification.
If such doubts are not clarified within the prescribed period, the Head of the KPRM will be obliged to notify the Heads of the Sejm or Senate of the inability to organise such a flight.

After the first training in Paris, the Poles are waiting for their last rival
Polish volleyball players held their first training in Paris on Friday, where they will play for the bronze medal on Saturday.
Vital Heynen's second-in-command closed his victory against the Slovenians on Thursday 1-3 in Ljubljana.
It was loud about their trouble to travel to this duel.
This time without such problems - on Friday morning they went with the Slovenian charter to Paris, and a few hours later they had their training in the famous Bercy Hall.
According to the reports of those present in the class, the world champion training officer was nervous.
As Heynen's assistant Michał Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not just to exercise the volleyball elements.
"We went to the hall, but in the vast majority it was time for the band.
It was about spending more time together than training.
To talk, to think about how to rebuild all this as a team, "he reported.
He confirmed that the semi-final failure was a painful lesson for both the players and the training staff.
"We have been brutally brought to earth.
No doubt we're disappointed.
We kept believing we were going to get back to that game.
We were discussing this game with each other at headquarters, and the coach talked a lot to the players.
As the two main causes of failure, I would point to failure in the attack and much worse than usual dealing with the situation balls.
The Slovenians were much better than us in this regard, "he analysed.
In his opinion, the "White and Red" did not stand in the way of the stress associated with the performance against the loud and numerous audience co-host of the tournament.
He admitted that the world champions might have put a little sleep on the smooth path to the semifinals.
"Perhaps if we had failed in a group phase in a similar way, we would have studied this lesson more quickly, and then otherwise we would have played in a later stage of the tournament.
But it's only if, "he said.
Gogol hopes that the anger associated with Thursday's defeat will be translated into aggression in a bronze match.
"I hope that we will show our true self then.
There's a lot to fight for.
Recently we won the ME medal in 2011, "he recalled.
Paris is the fifth city and France is the third country visited by Poles during these championships.
In the group phase, they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, went to Apeldoorn for the first two group meetings, and moved to Ljubljana for the semi-final.
Nick Kyrgios: severe punishment, but suspended
Australian tennis player received a 16-week launch ban and a fine of $25,000 - in half a year suspension - for reproach words, gestures and actions during the last ATP tournaments.
ATP World Tour activists lose patience with Kyrgios, but they still give him a chance to improve.
The summary of the offences of the most uncurled professional tennis player of recent years looks dangerous - 16 weeks break plus a large fine, but the two penalties are suspended for six months - a trial period during which the wayward athlete will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he's been messing around for a long time and he's got a kind of tennis record in the world - he had to pay the highest single financial penalty in the history of discipline for breaking the rules of conduct on the court and next to it.
Loud curses, strange gestures, unsportsmanlike behavior, insulting the judge and spectators, breaking two rockets during a losing match with Karen Chachanov - for all this after the August ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati paid $13,000.
In the US Open 2019 he did not play long either, but he was able to publicly say that ATP activists were "corrupt," which hurt the organization authorities so much that they implemented a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks they gave the above-mentioned verdict about suspension of take-offs and the next fine.
But the words of corruption were forgiven, after hearing the guilty and knowing the context of the statement.
In the explanatory memorandum, however, the tennis activists stated that the investigation showed that Kyrgios' behaviour over the past 12 months in many cases raised serious concerns and constituted almost constant violations of the rules, that he was constantly insulting people involved in tournaments and spectators in a vulgar manner, hence a high penalty.
However, the ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately postponed the execution of the judgment by requiring several conditions to be met within the next six months: in the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgios, it is no longer possible for him to violate the rules of the code of conduct of professional tennis players, in particular, to curse, destroy rockets, argue with judges and the public, or any other way to behave indecent and vulgar.
He was also recommended to seek "continuous support" from mental trainers during tournaments and also off-season consultations with those who are specialised in solving the problems of athletes who are unable to cope with proper behaviour.
Nick Kyrgios's first commentary (on social media) to the verdict was, "Hey, everybody, I can still play.
I just need to control my behavior, that's all. "
In practice, the Australian will have a break of at least two weeks, as the shoulder injury was exacerbated in the Laver Cup, so he had to give up the next take-off in Beijing (30 September - 6 October) and Shanghai (6-13 October).
In the ranking of ATP Kyrgios takes 27th place.
This year he won two tournaments - in Washington and Acapulco, he made over 1.3 million dollars, so even after the fines he will have a lot left.
GUS: In Poland, life is getting better
The report on household budgets published by the GUS on Friday shows that as good or rather good a material situation was estimated by as many as 44% of them.
This figure was 37.2% in the previous year, 33.5% in 2016, and previously, since 2009, when the statistical office first examined the subjective assessment of the situation of households, it never exceeded 30%.
A total of 8.1% of households considered their material situation to be bad or rather bad, compared to 11.2% in 2009 and more than 20% in 2009.
The best is the material situation of self-employed households.
In this group, over 70% of respondents consider it good or rather good.
At the second pole are households of pensioners, where the proportion of such responses was only 18%.
The subjective assessment of the material situation of households is also strongly influenced by the number of children.
The worst is for single parents, of whom 32% declare a good or rather good material situation.
Among couples with children, this percentage varies (depending on the number of children) from 55% to 60% and 48.8% among childless households.
In these statistics, the effect of the 500 + programme is clearly visible.
Before it was launched (in 2016), the worst material situation was assessed by single-parent parents and multiple families (with at least three children).
Improving subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles is a reflection of the rapid increase in income, especially from work.
That is not all, however, because the percentage of households who consider their situation to be good is increasing faster than real income.
Moreover, there is no clear link at the level of voivodships between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households.
The best assessments are made by the inhabitants of Opolskie voivodship, where 48.9% of respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.
Then there are Lubuskie (47.7%), Silesian (47.6%), Mazovian (47.3%) and Western Pomeranian (47.1%) voivodships.
However, in Opole, disposable income (i.e. after taxes and contributions) was less than 94% of the national average and 98% in Lubusk.
The highest income was paid by the people of Mazowiecki (120% of the national average) and Silesian (104%).
On average in Poland the disposable income per person was PLN 1693 in 2018.
In real terms (after adjustment for the impact of price developments), it increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.
Against the background of past years, it's a pretty low score.
In 2016, per capita income increased by 7% and a year later by 6.3%.
While income growth slows down, it also inhibits expenditure growth.
These per person amounted to PLN 1187, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.
This is the first case since 2013.
In 2017, expenditure per person increased by 1.9% in real terms and by 4.3% in 2016.
Household budget surveys suggest that the statistical household currently spends 70.1% of its disposable income, while in 2014 this share exceeded 80% and by 2006 it exceeded 90%.

USA: Three suicides among the aircraft carrier crew
Three sailors committed suicide on board the USS, George H. W. Bush, last week, reported by the U.S. Navy.
In the last two years, a total of five crew members of this ship have been killed.
The previous suicide took place in July this year and the previous suicide took place in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors shot themselves last week.
Each of the events occurred on land when the USS George H. W. Bush docked off the Virginia coast.
So far, third party involvement has been excluded.
In addition, death is not to be linked.
"We need everyone to be involved in making suggestions and ideas about how we can prevent another suicide.
I would like to stress that there is no stigmatisation or any other repercussions in seeking help, "wrote on Facebook Captain Sean Bailey, commander of the ship.
Niesiołowski criticized the Pope.
John Paul II did nothing.
In his interview with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesiołowski stressed that in 1981 John Paul II was a huge authority for opposition activists.
"In fact, every sentence he ever said was accepted."
Then there was criticism of some of his actions.
"For me, the fact that John Paul II was unable to eliminate Rydzyk's harmful activities is a great shadow on his pontificate.
After all, this Redemptorist - the pest of the Church and Poland - has developed his media into the best in the life of the Polish Pope, "he explained.
Former PO politician admitted: "there was a murmur of discontent, the Pope said something, once Rydzyka did not accept, but he had power and for politics he could simply throw him out of the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to raise money for the poor.
But John Paul II did not do it, and so did his successor, "explains Niesiołowski.
"In addition, this terrible matter of paedophilia and the Church's actions, or their lack, has come to light.
I ran a little forward with my thoughts, but I wanted to draw attention to the whole of his life.
The pedophile scale in the Church has been known for a relatively short time.
The question arises as to how John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know these disgusting things, "he says in his conversation with the journalist Niesiołowski.
In the opinion of the former PO policy, the Polish Church is an ally of the PIS.
"It must be acknowledged that during the period of Solidarity, the Church was our most important ally.
All the ceremonies began with the Holy Mass, and there were crosses everywhere.
Now these crosses are scriptural, they have become a symbol of dictatorship - a sign of the scriptural regime.
I repeat: one of the most unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk shake the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing about it, and that today the Church is an ally of the PIS.
This is the black chapter of the Polish Church, for which he will pay dearly, "convinced Niesiołowski.
"I hope Pope Francis will chase Jędraszewski, Rydzyk and a few more of these types," he concluded.

PZPN is punishing us for brawling at the stadiums.
Gryff disqualified
The clash in the Polish Cup between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gdañsk almost ended tragically when Zlatana Alomerović, who was launched by the fans of Wejherov, went by millimetres.
After that incident, the game was interrupted for 20 minutes.
The PZPN committee investigating this case has inflicted a severe penalty on Grief, excluding him from future games.
The club will not be able to compete in the Polish Cup in the 2020 / 2021 season.
In addition, fans will not be allowed into their own stadium in the next game.
They won't be able to go to the league games until December 31.
Burdy at the stadium of Widzew Łódź was also called by the fans of Śląska Wrocław.
Here, however, the PZPN judgment was more lenient because Silesia warned that similar events could occur and that it was sensitising the relevant authorities in this regard.
Despite this, the services allowed the Łódź sector to be cast off by racers, the burning of chairs and the forging of the host sector.
This game was interrupted for eight minutes, and the intervening police had to use the water cannon.
PZPN penalised Silesia with a one-off stadium ban in the next match in the Polish Cup and prohibited the organisation of trips to matches in this and the next edition of PP.
The travel ban also covered the league matches of the Ekstraklasie, but there it will last until 31 December.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
The GDDKiA plans to exchange labelling across the managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Rzeszów
In Podkarpacie, the implementation of the revised regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on, inter alia, the registration of foreign city names on road signs has also begun in Polish.
For example, "Lviv" will appear next to "L'viv."
In our voivodship changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it's supposed to be easier, clearer and simpler.
The new guidelines result from the revision of the Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure on detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices.
"We should remember that the names of the village in the neighbouring countries are often also Polish.
Thanks to the change we have prepared in law, they will finally appear on the signposts on our roads.
The introduction of the new label starts with the Podkarpackie section of the A4 motorway, "informed the Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk.
On Podkarpacie, changes will be made to 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total investment cost?
200,000 zloty.
As a first step, the new marking will be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is planned by 1 November 2019.
What is the realization of the idea?
There will be no replacement of plates, as in stickers.
They will replace the existing names of the village with new ones, written in Polish on existing signs.
Both names will be written in one line - first in Polish and then in the original, in parentheses.
This will be a great facilitation for people who do not know the spelling of the names of foreign cities in the language of the country in which they are located.

Someone shot a swan out of a windmill.
In the pond in Zameczno, in Lower Silesia, the residents noticed a swan with a wingspan problem.
After catching up and visiting the vet, it turned out that someone had made an animal a target - in his body they found a shotgun from a windmill.
"He received information about the early bird from the villagers of the Wild Animal Rehabilitation Centre in Nowa Sola.
According to the report, the animal had broken wings.
We went to the scene.
You could tell there was something really wrong with him.
We acted quickly and precisely so as not to hurt him or expose him to additional stress.
The swan was caught and taken to the vet.
After the first X-ray, it was already known that someone had turned him into a shooting shield.
There were shrapnel fragments in his body, "says Marcin Walasek, CEO of Malpol, which manages, among other things, the rehabilitation centre.
I'll stay in the resort for a winter.
"The wounds have been cleared, the bird has been given antibiotics, water access, a safe place in the resort where he will spend the whole winter.
We're trying to strengthen it.
He's not capable of flying yet.
To release it now would mean that it would most likely not survive the winter, "adds Walesek.
The staff will release him into the same pond in the spring after he has submitted to the swan of rehabilitation.
The authorities of the municipality of Żukowice, after being informed of the cause of the animal's poor health, intend to inform the prosecution.
The event occurred in Zameczno
Gowin: "We must stimulate Polish, small trade"
"Effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the State has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade," said the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Science and Higher Education, leader of the Jarosław Gowin Agreement on Friday.
Gowin, during his interview with "Signals of the Day" in Radio One, stated that trade is controlled by international networks that impose so low margins on Polish producers that, in fact, Polish companies cannot develop.
As it is very difficult to fight this problem, the Deputy Prime Minister recalled that the PIS government tried to deal with it at the very beginning of its term of office, but got a "counter-opinion from the EC."
"We have won before the Court of Justice, and I hope that if the United Right wins the next election and forms a government, we will return to that topic," he said.
At the same time, he pointed out that "effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish and, therefore, small trade."
"This will have to be considered whether the government, the state, has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade," said Gowin.
In May, the EU court found that the European Commission made a mistake recognising that the Polish retail tax was unlawful public aid.
The Retail Tax Act provided for the introduction of two rates of trade tax: 0.8% on revenue between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4% on revenue above PLN 170 million per month.
The tax was due to apply from September 2016.
The EC initiated infringement proceedings in September 2016 by Poland.
Brussels then argued that the construction of the tax could favour smaller shops, which could be considered public aid.
It further claimed that the tribute had been unlawfully implemented.
It also issued an order to suspend the application of the tax until its analysis was completed by officials in Brussels.
Poland did not agree with this position, but the collection of the tax was suspended.
The EU court's decision in May opened the way for a re-introduction of the tax, but it did not finish the case.
On 24 July, the Commission lodged an appeal with the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the press service of the EUSF informed PAP that the case is now in writing, in which both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.
For the time being, it is not known whether and when the oral procedure will begin, i.e. the hearing of the parties and a possible hearing.
It takes a good few to several months from the appeal to the judgment.
"This procedure lasts on average a year," said the PAP source at the Luxembourg Court.
How do you dress a child for baptism?
We offer some practical solutions
Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of the infant and his parents.
It is often the first opportunity for the whole family to gather around the child, celebrating his arrival in the world together.
No wonder, then, that freshly baked mother and father want their comfort to look their best this day.
But before you make the final decision about the baby's outfit, think about whether it'll be comfortable.
In the shops you can find a number of stylish sets that do not provide the little one with the right comfort.
So what should I pay attention to?
The basic criterion for choosing a christening outfit is the age of the child
Until recently, the children were baptized into white sets and put into the same barrels or big pillows.
Today, children entering the sacrament are often older: several months, annual or even larger.
It's not hard to imagine that such a great comfort needs a slightly different garment for baptism.
Therefore, if your child is 3-4 months on the day of the baptism, he will probably spend the ceremony in a wheelchair or in the hands of his parents or godparents.
The best way to do that is to dress him up in comfortable cotton sleeping bags or sets.
Although this garment element is considered to be a daily garment, it is enough to search for its festive variants, for example, with a phalbanka or lace.
For the boy, it will be perfect to have a body printed with bow ties and braces.
For older children, you can afford to have a bigger fantasy in your clothes.
The girl will look lovely in a simple tulle dress
Many of the parents of the girls with empathy look towards the richly decorated, wavy christening dresses complete with coats, headbands and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, non-breathable materials in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
In order to find the right outfit, it is better to look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant outfits on cotton linings.
Gentle, tulle skirts, satin dresses, lace, apps and charming sets will make your little girl look beautiful and comfortable.
Perfect outfit for a little gentleman: cotton suit
Until recently, the boys' parents were in fashion for suits that were a copy of "adult" models.
Polyester jackets and trousers, rigid collars or caskets often made young elegant people loudly demonstrate their dissatisfaction.
Today, fortunately, they were pushed out by comfortable cotton sets.
Just look at the sets available in Asanti for Kids, which is soft, tracksuit shorts, and a top decorated in front of the vest.
These outfits look very festive, but at the same time they don't embarrass the movements of the world-knowing little man.
Krystyna Pawłowicz published a declaration of assets
Krystyna Pawłowicz made a declaration of assets at the end of his term of office.
It shows that Mrs PiS has accumulated 110 thousand zlotys of savings.
Let us remind you that Pavlovich has announced his departure from politics.
At the end of his term of office, he has an amount of PLN 110 thousand.
According to the statement made by the Member, she receives a monthly pension of PLN 4.7,000.
Pawłowicz has an apartment worth 570 thousand zł and slightly smaller, which he rents, collecting 880 zł per month.
The Member also invests in industrial metals, valuing the investment at PLN 150,000.
Previously, a declaration of assets was also published by Jarosław Kaczyński.
Voting on the adjournment of the Conservative Party Conference
British parliamentarians voted against a three-day break in the House of Commons during the annual Conservative Party Programme Conference, as requested by the government.
289 Members voted in favour, against 306.
As a rule, the House of Commons does not sit at party conferences so that Members do not have to give up either their participation or their parliamentary meetings.
However, the opposition parties considered that, at such a crucial time as the last weeks before the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union on 31 October, Parliament should not interrupt its deliberations.
289 Members voted in favour of the government's request for a break, 306 against.
Two opposition parties after the conventions
Failure to agree to a break can be seen as political revenge for the opposition at Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday the decision was declared illegal and non-existent by the Supreme Court) and for the fact that, after the judge's ruling, he does not want to apologize for it.
Following this ruling, the House of Commons resumed its session on Wednesday, and the most important event of the day was Johnson's speech and the ensuing turbulent debate.
Johnson accused the opposition of blocking brevite and avoiding early elections.
"The time has come to realize the brexit.
It must be implemented in order to respect the outcome of the referendum.
Brexit must come so that we can deal with the agreement on citizens' priorities, on health care, on living costs.
Brexit needs to be realized so we can unite this country, "said Johnson.
The Conference of the Conservative Party is scheduled to begin in Manchester next Sunday and will continue until Wednesday 2 October.
The two main groups of the opposition - the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats - have already held conferences.
One of the justifications that Johnson gave explaining such a long suspension of parliament was the party conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
"President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders," writes the foreign media.
The President's spokesperson has strongly disagreed with these reports.
"That's just not true," he tweeted "Swanny Spychalski."
Israeli media, including "Haaretz" and "Jerusalem Post," refer to the "Jewish Insider," say Andrzej Duda at a meeting with representatives of the Jewish Diaspora at the Polish consulate in New York declared that Israel was responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The President said that the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland was a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to the words of Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who stated in February that "Poles sucked anti-Semitism with mother's milk."
Andrzej Duda said he regretted Israel not apologizing for the humiliating statements of its politicians.
He also mentioned the act of aggression against the Polish ambassador in Israel, Marek Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by an assailant who screamed, "Polish, Polish."
"The quote is not only inaccurate.
It's just not true, "he tweeted" Spichalski "on Twitter.
He stressed that Duda "never said that Israel was responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland."
According to Spychalski, the portal "invented it."
According to the "JI" interlocutors, there was also a dispute between the Holocaust survivor, decorated with the Commander's Cross of the Polish Order of Merit by Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was to agree with the words of President Duda and say that it was the Jews of Israel, "such as Israel's Kac," who are responsible for the increase in anti-Semitism.
According to the source of the Boteach portal, he was about to interrupt Mosberg's statement.
Who's Banah and what's his fault?
Rented by the tenement sisters led the journalist to discover negligence in Marian Banasia's affidavits.
We are summarizing another scandal that has shaken the ruling camp.
TVN's "Supervisionary" journalists have revealed that Marian Banasz, President of the Supreme Chamber of Control, has not entered in a declaration of property of a 400-metre-long tenement building in Kraków Podgórze in recent years.
Moreover, his subtenant was to run in the mentioned house sex business (i.e. rent rooms for hours).
As a result, the Commission considers that the aid is compatible with the internal market within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the Treaty.
Bertold Kittel's attention was drawn to the irregularities in the program "Supervisionary."
The journalist revealed that Banasia's tenement was used by people connected to the criminal world to use it as a place for "erotic encounters."
The clients were to be men using the services of prostitutes.
Banasz answered the charges in a vague and cloudy manner.
Interestingly, the tenement rented by the tenants led the journalist to discover negligence in Banasia's affidavits.
The tenement itself was not clearly described in them, and the income from its rental was to be understated.
"The estate of Marian Banasia and his wife can be worth between PLN 6 and 8 million.
In total, spouses can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings [...], "writes Money.pl.
And according to the analysis of the portal, Banasia's building itself was already worth about PLN 3 million.
The Central Anti-Corruption Office is currently carrying out an audit of Marian Banasia's claims for the years 2015-2019.
Banasz announced that he would suspend his activities at NIK by the time it was completed. "I will present to your marshal for free leave," he assured.
The opposition demands an explanation.
"We do not hear the CBA expand its investigation or accelerate the investigation of Marian Banasia's assets.
That is why we are forced to perform the authorities of the state and to report the possibility of committing a crime [...], "said PO-KO Mariusz Witczak.
"If a normal Pole so blatantly valued the rental of his properties, he would already have 10 checks, tax revenue and tax-related proceedings," he added.
He went high, he fell low.
Marian Banasz is the new president of the Supreme Chamber of Control.

Cooler Master launches a handle for graphics cards
Graphic cards can now weigh a lot, and this naturally makes room for a category of products that would have been vain to look for on a shelf a decade ago.
This is the solution - the handle for the ELV8 RGB graphics card - presented by Cooler Master.
The new model of the graphics card holder is not only a functional solution to ensure that the graphics card is maintained more effectively without relying solely on the PCI-express slot strength.
Cooler Master ELV8 RGB also has an additional task - decorative.
"Rzeczpospolita": Ignoring a police officer will be punished
According to the newspaper, disregard of a specific conduct order issued by a police officer is supposed to be a new form of misdemeanor, punishable by a fine, arrest or restriction of liberty.
A change like this is what the police union wants.
The idea came to the Sejm Petitions Commission.
"The case is serious because there are more than half a million criminal cases in Polish courts every year," we read.
The "Rzeczpospolita" has established that the petition which the Independent Police Union is writing to Members on the revision of the Code of Offences has a chance to succeed.
The petitioner proposes a new wording of Article 54a of the Code of Offences.
It would read: "He who does not comply with the request or order of a public officer, issued within the limits and under the provisions of the law, is punishable by arrest, fine or limitation of liberty."
"Paragraph 3 of this provision refers to an identical penalty for those who do not follow the instructions, prevent or hinder the performance of their duties," gives the log.
The sociologist Andrzej Kowalski said "Rzeczpospolita" that although he agrees with the main message of the proposal, he fears that if implemented, it can be used in political matters.
"This would be unfavourable in free-movement situations, and instead of mitigating the situation, it would even sharpen it," he adds.
According to the statistics reported by the newspaper, 86% of citizens were positive about police interventions in 2018 and 1.5 million people in the city each month.
Buras is worried about Europe.
Jáchym Topol has written in his blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
The father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important post-war Czech playwrights, today exchanged in one row with Václav Havel.
So, from the beginning, Jáchym was cursed with a talent that he was trying to exploit.
After eight years, he came back with "Sensitive Man."
The heroes are Buras and Soňa, along with two sons, who, however, do not form a typical Czech family.
They're traveling actors, traveling across Europe.
He's a Shakespeare lover and a thief, she's a one-eyed translator who doesn't break up with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys hasn't made a sound since he was born, and for the other he stopped in infancy.
But it's not the heroes who are most important in this story.
They are all just a background to a world where there is no room for artistic nomads anymore.
It's a world of flea provinces, a society of old, suspicious people and promiscuous young people.
"Sensitive man" sometimes turns into an absurd theater.
Narration mimics Didaskalia, and the conversation of heroes creates this world.
The stage is a Europe full of concerns about its future, but also constant questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancelled 105 flights due to bankruptcy of Thomas Cook
Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook has failed, its Belgian subsidiary Neckermann is functioning.
The company, however, has problems.
According to VRT, Brussels Airlines announced that they would cancel 105 flights in October due to the bankruptcy problems of Thomas Cook.
Neckermann also fired 75 employees.
All trips with the office that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but vacationers will be able to receive a refund.
The court in Gandawa also declared three Belgian daughter companies bankrupt: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently, around 12,000 Belgians are abroad on trips purchased from Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were supposed to leave with the office by the end of the year.
Even on Monday, spokesperson Thomas Cook Belgium Leen Segers said that the company is now "fully operational" despite being declared bankrupt by a British parent company, which has caused concern among employees and customers.
At the time, the office calmed down that the customers who bought the tours in it were going on vacation.
Thomas Cook - the oldest and one of the largest travel agencies in the world - declared bankruptcy last night from Sunday to Monday.
The immediate cause of bankruptcy was the collapse of the last-chance talks with creditors and potential investors on Sunday.
The creditors demanded that, in addition to the EUR 900 million rescue plan already agreed in August, the company gain an additional 200 million as collateral for the winter period, when travel agencies usually have lower turnover.
However, the company's problems have been growing for several years, resulting in a debt of £1.6 billion.

Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for reviews
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion - such an unusual offer was prepared for visitors by German Görlitz.
Actions are designed to help combat the progressive decline in the population of the city.
Görlitz is Germany's most eastern city.
The beautiful pastel old town attracts 140,000 tourists a year.
However, as the Guardian writes, the city is facing significant problems.
Görlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.
The city is also struggling with a permanent loss of population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them went west, which resulted in a 25% decline in the city population.
In 2013, it amounted to 54 000 people.
In order to fight depopulation, officials came up with the idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
So far, 150 applications have been received.
Two thirds of them were made up by the inhabitants of the big cities.
People from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom were also interested in the programme.
"When we applied, we thought the program was going to convince people to move to Görlitz," said one of the project participants.
"Now we feel that it doesn't matter whether we stay here after four weeks or not," he added.
The city has 7,000 vacant apartments, and unemployment is three times the average in the whole country.
While the city authorities hope that some will move permanently, the main objective of the programme is to obtain the opinion of the participants in the programme.
Information collected from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revitalise smaller German cities.
"We want to know more about what people need, and if they decide to move - what their motivation was," said Robert Knippschild.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas for attracting new residents, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a programme of paying promising young professionals to live and work in the city for a year.
Today, such a solution is applied in many places, from the Greek island of Antikyther to Candela in Italy, or in the American Tulsa, Oklahoma.
