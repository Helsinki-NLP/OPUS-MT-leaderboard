Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe
He's a charismatic.
The Holy Masses which he celebrated for liberation and healing draw crowds away.
He was a dozen years old when things inexplicable began to happen in his life.
Today, through the Franciscan, others experience it.
The Holy Mass for liberation and healing, celebrated by Fr.
The parents of a 7-month-old child who had a hole of 7.5 mm in his heart came to him once.
It was supposed to be operated on.
Father Joseph Witko prayed for him.
The same day the boy was taken to the hospital for surgery.
Amazing doctors decided: "The operation is not needed, the loss is only 1.5 mm."
My parents wept for happiness.
After another prayer, the Franciscan hole disappeared completely.
The Creator's spiritual extraordinary activities began to be experienced as a teenager.
In his dreams, purgatory souls came to him asking for help.
I was awakened at night and urged to pray for the dead and those who died at the moment," he recalls.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits mortal sin.
"My body began to change.
I lost human qualities and began to take on the appearance of an animal," he says.
The invisible force lifted him up, couldn't get his voice out.
He felt he was lost.
Then God pointed out to him a rescue.
"Down in the waters of the river symbolizing holy baptism, I was freed and returned to human form," he says.
He didn't tell anyone about these strange experiences.
His calling was ripening in him.
He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.
In his sermons, he wanted not only to talk about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience him alive.
Members of the charismatic renewal community in the Holy Spirit
In Masses about the healing performed by the father Witko participates many people who hope to get rid of the disease.
However, the clergyman emphasizes that their primary goal is spiritual healing rather than physical healing.
First failure of Kolpinga Frac Jarosław
Today's (26th September) afternoons the team of Kolpinga Frac deserved to be with the current Polish champion Dartom Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki as part of the 3rd LOTTO Superliga of Table Tennis.
Jarosławians in such a personal composition as they presented with the patrons have little chance of winning against the sovereigns of the league.
The Dart Bogoria duel showed this very clearly.
The team's still missing, the team leader, Chen Jingqi.
Perhaps with him, the jaroslavans would reach for the third consecutive triumph in the new season.
The young Asian Qiyao Han hasn't grown up to win against the Greek Panagiotis Gionis or the Czech Pavel Sirucek yet.
Not even with one of the most prospective Poles, Mark Badowski.
The player from Heldada was the biggest star of a duel in the MOSiR hall at Sikorskiego Street in Jarosław.
Both in the confrontation with Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei was a class for himself.
After three duels, Kolping Frac led 2:1.
Kou Lei probably played Mark Badowski and Daniel Górak after the exciting five hundred battle - Pavla Sirucka.
But then it got worse.
Gionis didn't give Lea a chance.
You could still hope to win for two points, but Qiyao Han failed to meet Badowski.
There won't be any extra research for seniors.
Why?
According to Rafał Trzaskowski's announcements, a free prevention program for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not gained the approval of the Ministry of Health and the Agency for the Protection of Medical Technologies and Tarification.
In the explanatory memorandum, the agency explained that the target group was wrongly selected.
"The above actions may even result in the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to the deepening of difficulties in accessing NFZ benefits and adversely affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with false positive results of the tests," wrote the report.
The department's decision doesn't understand the president of the capital.
"The money is ours, we've predicted it.
Only the government is afraid that if people get tested, they'll go to a doctor later, which is ridiculous, because it's precisely to lead to a situation where prevention can be done more quickly.
All experts know that this helps when it comes to the burden of the health system, because it helps to detect diseases quickly and in a reliable approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand," said Rafał Trzaskowski.
"I find it hard to imagine that experts say: Let's not examine ourselves because there will be longer queues at the doctor's office, and if such specialists advise the government, it is no wonder that health care is in such a state," added the politician PO.
Palestine corresponds to Israel: We will break all existing agreements
On Thursday, Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas announced at the session of the UN General Assembly that he would break all agreements with Israel if the future government of this country tried to fulfill Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement of an annexation of occupied Palestinian lands.
"If the future government of Israel, which shall arise, proceed to the completion of this plan, we shall cancel all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all the commitments made," he said.
"We will reject the whole plan completely and completely," he threatened with the pressure of Abbas.
"It is our duty to defend all our rights with all possible means - the minor consequences of this - by fully engaging in the implementation of international law and the fight against terrorism," said the President of the Palestinian Authority, who made similar declarations in July.
Netanyahu, the former Prime Minister of Israel, after the elections of September 17, was again given a mission to form the government.
A week before the election, he announced that if he wins, he would declare the Jordan Valley annexation and intend to include all the Jewish settlements in Israel throughout the West Bank.
In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, led by Jaser Arafat, signed a series of peace agreements, which were patronized by the United States.
The 84-year-old Abbas also promised to hold universal elections on Palestinian soil during the session of the UN General Assembly.
The last one was held in 2006.
"When I return to the country, I will call local elections in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem and all those who oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community," declared the Palestinian President.
Abbas also defended in his speech the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer in the United Nations, the exercise of the powers of "the full members of the United Nations and of all its organs and institutions."
The Palestinian leader concluded with a call to the international community to "force Israel to comply fully with the provisions of the United Nations."
Israel's Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas' speech, declaring that the Palestinian leader "would rather focus in the UN on the efforts of the Palestinian Authority against Israel than against the calls for terrorism in the Authority under its leadership."
Danon, as noted by the agencies, did not refer to the annexation announced by Netanyahu of occupied Palestinian lands.
Paramedics want defibrillators at the critical points of Przemyśl
History from the border crossing shows that an automatic AED defibrillator can save lives.
The Przemysl Regional Emergency Station wants such devices to be located in sensitive points of the city.
For their attitude officers received congratulations diplomas from the Provincial Emergency Station in Przemyśl.
Applicator Daniel Cyrnek, Senior Applicator Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek Wójcik are officers of the Podkarpackie Tax Office in Przemyśl.
On 28 August, they served at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medyce. A customs officer noticed a lying unconscious man in the pedestrian zone.
A Chinese activist died in custody because of torture.
He wanted to take advantage of the rights guaranteed by the Constitution
Cao Shuxia, the wife of an activist, called on September 23, the Secretary of the Communist Party from her home village to announce that her husband had just died in a military hospital in Hengyang.
Which was the cause of death, he didn't reveal.
In Cao's morgue, she saw her husband's body massacred, unrecognizable.
"His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were covered in blood," says the woman.
"They wouldn't let me take my cell phone with them, and there were a lot of cops around who wouldn't get close to Wang."
The police pressured her to sign a statement that her husband was seriously ill and died of an "unhappy accident."
PLN 105 million for companies in the video games industry from the National Centre for Research and Development
Nearly PLN 105 million of funding will go to companies from the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.
The National Centre for Research and Development announced the results of the third edition of the GameINN program on Friday.
Among the nearly 30 projects supported by NCBR, among others, the development of a platform for field games based on the AR game engine that creates a map of the real world together with an application that allows users to transmit data; a test and training platform to verify practical skills on the workstation and professional improvement using VR and AI technologies; an innovative game simulating the management of real production processes using an innovative gameplay model based on the interaction of the virtual world with the real world with the use of the concept of industry 4.0 - is provided in the NCBR communication sent on Friday by PAP.
The goal of the sector-specific programme GameINN is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game industry in the global market by 2023.
According to the NCBR, today the Polish video game sector is growing at a rate of 10% per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 amounted to PLN 1.85 billion, while the forecast for 2019 was 2.23 billion.
"The specially prepared research agenda GameINN and already reaching PLN 300 million support for entrepreneurs under this sector programme are an important impetus for the further dynamic growth of the Polish gamedev," we read in the Communication.
The video game industry is an excellent example of the effective exploitation of the potential we have in Poland.
"The government's incentives for innovative entrepreneurs, such as R &amp; D reliefs, competence improvement programmes, IP box and support programmes implemented by NCBR drive innovative businesses and allow them to compete more effectively in a highly competitive market," says Deputy Prime Minister Jarosław Gowin, Minister of Science and Higher Education, quoted in the Communication.
The head of the Ministry of Science notes that the money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of funding projects, but also stays in their pockets - three quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from the R &amp; D relief in 2018 than a year ago.
"The amount of deducted costs related to R &amp; D activities amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which resulted in over PLN 300 million savings for companies benefiting from this relief.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCBR in three GameINN editions," emphasizes the Deputy Prime Minister.
Wojciech Kamieniecki, director of the NCBR, reminds us that in the previous two competitions funding with a total value of over PLN 211.2 million was awarded to 78 innovative projects.
The great interest in the third competition and the variety of proposals submitted show that the video gaming industry has ideas and competences to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.
"In particular, it welcomes the fact that the selected projects - as in previous editions - include projects for not only entertainment but also industry-related 4.0 solutions," he adds.
In the third competition GameINN for funding up to PLN 20 million were able to apply for entrepreneurs, consortium of entrepreneurs and consortium of entrepreneurs with scientific units.
The NCBR received 87 applications for the total amount of funding about PLN 317 million.
The budget of the competition at the time of the announcement of the competition was PLN 100 million, but it was increased, thanks to which 27 projects were awarded almost PLN 105 million of funding.
Detailed information on the results of the 3rd GameINN competition is available at ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN sector programme is implemented under the Intelligent Development Operational Programme.
NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated with the Polish Games Agreement, including such companies as CD Project, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team and 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga confessed to stealing Kasper Dolberg's watch
The event took place on September 16th.
Dolberg, who arrived in Nice from Ajaksu Amsterdam at the end of August, realized after training that his watch had disappeared from the locker room.
Not just any, because it's worth 70,000 euros.
An angry Dane didn't show up for class the next day, explaining his stomach problems.
It's been a mystery since the beginning.
Soccer players in the locker room have private safes at their disposal, and the club area is monitored.
According to the AFP agency, he finally confessed to theft by the Devil-Fadig.
The 18-year-old has already apologized to Dolberg and other teammates and to coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised the Dane to return the money for his watch.
Devils-Fadiga is one of the most prospective footballers of the young generation in France.
He went to Nice as a 13 - year - old to debut in the first band three years later.
He played seven games this season.
He recently signed a professional contract, but, according to the L'Equipe newspaper, the club is likely to terminate it immediately.
For now, he's brought disciplinary action against his player.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on this.
See if you wash your hands well.
We all know that you have to wash them (e.g. when you come home or before a meal).
But not everyone knows that to actually get rid of germs, you have to do it the right way.
It's especially important now that the fall infections are approaching.
It takes at least 30-40 seconds to wash enough to remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands.
And most of us wash them less!
Warm water and plain soap are enough - it is not true that it must be antibacterial (many doctors even advise against it).
By washing, we rub not only the bottoms and the top of the hand, but also: fingertips (connected or individually) - rub them with circular movements about the inside of the other hand, spaces between the fingers (twist your hands, rub your fingers against each other), thumbs - each thumb embraces the other hand and in such embraces we spin a moment to the right and left.
In an emergency situation (when hands cannot be washed) we should wipe our hands with a wet tissue and then use antibacterial gel (in drugstores, from 5 zł).
After using the public toilet, do not touch the door or door with your hands washed (recommendation of the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate).
Open it with a paper towel.
The Iranian President says he refused to talk to the United States, Donald Trump denies it.
Tehran did not engage with the U.S. party during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite the offer offered by the Americans to abolish sanctions, said Iranian President Hasan Rowhani on Friday.
U.S. President Donald Trump commented that it was the Iranian side that asked to abolish the restrictions, which he refused to accept.
According to Iranian President Hasan Rowhani, the Americans have proposed to abolish all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiating a new international agreement.
It would regulate both Iran's nuclear programme and the ballistic missile programme.
Rowhani: Iran will not engage in talks in the atmosphere of maximum pressure
The Iranian President stated that he had refused to take these talks because of the "toxic atmosphere."
He declared that he had met with American diplomats because he was inclined by France, Germany, and the United Kingdom.
However, he stressed that Iran would not engage in talks in an atmosphere of "maximum pressure."
"And even if we want to negotiate with Americans in 5+1 format, no one can predict what the final result will be," said Rowhani.
The day before, the Iranian leader said that he did not rule out talks with the US, and that the European parties to the nuclear agreement were accused of promoting U.S. sanctions against Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran following the US withdrawal from the nuclear agreement "are a prerequisite that does not allow for dialogue."
If we can lift this precondition and if America can lift sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America - he declared.
He added that he did not rule out a meeting with President Donald Trump of the United States, even though he did not agree to such a conversation during the last week of the UN General Assembly.
Trump: "Iran asked, I said no."
Donald Trump tweeted that he rejected the Iranian party's request.
"Iran wanted me to abolish the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course I said no!" tweeted the President of the United States.
Voltage with a nuclear agreement in the background
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to ease the tensions between Washington and Tehran in some form to save the 2015 agreement with Iran, which they were signatories to.
It stated that, in exchange for the abolition of economic sanctions, Iran would abandon the nuclear weapons programme and that the nuclear sector would be under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the withdrawal of the USA from the agreement in May 2015, the other signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to maintain the agreement in force.
It hasn't worked out so far.
Washington is using a tactic of maximum pressure on Iran, and sanctions include a full embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran has announced that if it is not authorised to export raw material, it will limit its obligations under the agreement every 60 days.

The judge of the Provincial Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of the hater Emilie, who, according to her words and screenshots from WhatsAppa, participated in the stalking of judges, was restored to the ruling by the NSA on Wednesday.
Reason: there has been no disciplinary action against him, so there is no reason to uphold the order of WSA president Wojciech Mazur to remove him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, spokesperson at the NSA, opened an investigation into Szmydt at the end of August, but it has not yet turned into a proceeding against him.
Although the NSA, which acts as a disciplinary tribunal in such cases, has to deal with the decision of the president of the NSA within one month of its issue.
In this situation, the judge, who publicly talked about his wife's mental problems to discredit her, who, due to suspicion of participation in the hater group, was removed from the KRS office, will return to judgment and will issue judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.
Judge Szmydt denies his participation in the hater group.
He says there's no evidence of that except for the fake screenshots and the words of his wife he's divorcing.
That's exactly what the other judges say about Casta: they're all innocent, there's no evidence.
And it's quite possible they'll be on their own.
Because the D.A.'s office didn't lift a finger to secure evidence from their electronic media, and it's also silent about the contents of Emilie Szmydt's phone, which she pulled over in June for another case.
The police didn't lift a finger to secure the devices of those who were persecuted by Judge Waldemar Żurek in the February report.
There's no evidence - no case of Szmydt, no case of Casta.
There is also no case of NIK Marian Banasia's boss to rent a tenement to pimps and hide their income.
The CBA shall verify his claims of property.
And he'll check it out when he checks it out.
The Committee on the Ethics of the European Union will not take care of Banas, because the Sejm is suspended (but the Committee on State Control has somehow gathered to make a curian decision to revoke the deputies of Banas and to appoint his lawyer, although the law does not provide for such a strange combination).
The whole thing reminds me of a movie novel, American, I think, about how my wife comes home and finds her husband with her lover in bed.
She's so amazed and devastated that she can't say a word.
She's standing in the door, she's numb, and in that time, the lover jumps out of bed quickly, dresses up and leaves.
And my husband made the bed.
When the wife gets her voice back and screams, what is this?
Who is this woman?
The husband asks calmly: what woman, darling?
It's just that there's a parody of the state about Casta or Banasia.
And that's not funny at all.

Kamila Lićwinko in high jump finals
Previously returning to competition this season after the maternity break, the brown medalist of the World Cup from London 2017, defeated 1,85 and 1,89 and the second 1,92 in the first attempt.
1,94 were only able to obtain it in the third approach.
"I'm glad.
I showed that I could fight because my first attempt was completely unsuccessful.
In the finals I will have to jump better technically," she admitted in front of the Eurosport Lićwinko camera.
In the eliminations the best was the American woman Vashti Cunningham and Belarusian Karina Demidik - after 1.94.
Both contestants were the only ones who didn't lose any height.
The women's jump finale is scheduled for Monday.
Beginning at 7:30 p.m. Polish time.
Kornel Morawiecki is in hospital in severe condition
He went to the hospital, and the doctors call his condition heavy.
We have to add that he's conscious and conscious.
"We believe he's gonna make it, he's gonna win again.
We all pray that he gets better," said an anonymous person named Kornel Morawiecki in a conversation with journalists of "Super Express."
In the upcoming elections, the Prime Minister's father is running for Senate.
"My immediate family and politics are keeping me alive," said Kornel Morawiecki in an interview, which he gave to journalists "Super Express" two weeks ago.
In January, "Super Express" informed that 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki had been researched at the Military Hospital in Wroclaw.
"I had strange, disturbing symptoms, and I went to the hospital.
It turns out I have jaundice.
But the worst part was before me.
When a CT scan was done, it was found that I had pancreatic cancer" and the Prime Minister's father handed it over.
A few days later, Kornel Morawiecki had a major operation at the MMA hospital in Warsaw.
As Morawiecki told us, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain to the hospital, priest Zbigniew Kras.
The operation lasted about three hours and went well.
"I know that many people have prayed for me for which I thank you very much.
Luckily, I don't have any metastases.
I don't know if I'm gonna be in chemo yet.
I turn myself in to specialist doctors who are rather hopeful.
For now, after this severe operation, I need to get back to some sort of usability state.
I hope everything will be okay," said Kornel Morawiecki in January in a conversation with "SE."
"If I had been tested too late, the situation would have been tragic and I would have said good-bye to this mess," he added.

Last time she was seen, she was wearing a sweatshirt, gray pants and shoes.

The power of the Oławski jumps.
The title of the relationship with amateur sports competitions, played on Sunday afternoon of September 15 on the hippodrome at Oleandry Street in Oława, can be confusing for some.
It is a long way to the true power, but this is what is called one of the types of horse rivalry...
The contest of the power of jumps consists in overcoming by the rider and horse ever higher obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed even two meters.
It is worth mentioning here that the long-term and still unbroken world record, established in 1949, by the Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the horse "Huaso," is 247 cm.
Of course, no one jumped so high in Oława, but the result of the best local amazons at the level of 135 cm also does not belong to the worst...
The competition organized by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other activists of the JKS "In the saddle" was a showpiece part of the "Rainbow Equestrian Competitions" played there, about which we write more widely in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.
The competition was attended by eight amazons who trained riding in the Oławski JKS.
Four were competing on pucks and four were competing on big horses.
In the first group, Nikola Szołdra, riding the crazy "Sprinter" was best done.
This small but dynamic rumor began by overcoming the obstacles spread at a height of 40 cm, and ended only at a station with a top beam about 125 cm away from the ground.
However, he did not give up easily and only after three further refusals was removed from competition by the jury.
Amelia Pawlak, riding "Fams" and the third Lena Borun on "Harmier" took second place in pony jumps.
The youngest contestant - Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping through obstacles on the small mare "Carmen" was ambitious.
Even greater emotions were accompanied by the starting amazons and the viewers during the competition with large horses.
Paulina Szewczyk, who was riding "The Declaration" and Anastasia Abramenko, who was driving on the Lotka, were hit by dangerous-looking falls.
Fortunately, apart from minor bruises, neither amazons nor horses were harmed, so they continued to participate in the competition.
A lot of problems with the introduction of the young mare "Wineta" in the park had a Weronika Łuckiewicz riding her.
It was either a trainer's assistant or another couple's horse that went after some crazy "Winet."
After passing the obstacle from the park, she also came down full-bodied, so for a while in the boxes and in the expansion room it was dangerous. "Everything is under control!" Jan Sienkiewicz calmed down a little bit with these frightened viewers, especially the youngest ones.
Since the beginning of the big horse competition, Marta Masalska has done a great job in the park, riding a beautifully presented "Whisky."
This distinguished mare, coupled with an experienced amazon, followed the second approach in the final phase as the first jumped 135 cm and it was the best result of the competition at that moment.
After a while, however, Paulina Szewczyk also scored the same height on "The Declaration," Weronika Łuckiewicz on "Vinet" and Anastasia Abramenko on "Lotka."
So all these riders left together, and finally together with the amazons on the ponies in Radecki's march made an impressive round of honor, ending with this interesting and exciting competition.

Max Kolonko cut off from KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko
KWW The Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko is the name of the electoral committee under which the political formation #R Revolution of Mariusz Max Kolonka was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution directed its proposal especially to young voters with right-wing views.
Before the elections, Kolonko announced cooperation with Mark Jakubiak or Paul Kukiz, but none of these coalitions happened, and the KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko could not even collect enough signatures to issue letters in any electoral district in Poland.
Now Kolonko announced on Twitter that he had completed cooperation with KWW the Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko.
"I will expect my name to be removed from the name of KWW.
I kindly ask you not to include my person with the above mentioned entity," he added and announced that more information will be given soon.
For now it is not known whether the journalist will continue his activity, or whether the #R Revolution formation is over.
On 4 July, on American Independence Day, a journalist in the United States, Mariusz Max Kolonko, informed about the uprising of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years Kolonko has become famous for running the Max TV channel on YouTube, where he comments on events in Poland and around the world.
"We've had enough politicians, enough of your stupid games, enough of your amateur governments.
It is time for the authorities in the country to take over the Nation and rule for the good of the Nation," said Kolonko.
The programme of the party included, among others, issues concerning the judiciary (should be chosen in the general election), tax changes (comparably free for all), war reparations (in the form of military assistance to the Eastern countries of the NATO flank, with particular attention to Poland), holding a referendum on the possession of weapons, the reduction of the number of Members or the introduction of one-mandate electoral districts.
A few days after the announcement of the new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko began talks with Mark Jakubiak.
At the end of July, Kolonko posted information on his social media profile suggesting that #R will join forces with the Kukiz'15 movement.
But none of these coalitions eventually happened.
UBS: Gold close to balance point
"The euro exchange rate will continue in the coming months around the ceiling of PLN 4.35, accompanied by a weak economic situation in global markets," says Michael Bolliger from the company UBS Wealth Management.
"The expectations of maintaining a steady pace of economic growth and stable monetary policy are in favour of stabilizing the price of gold at the current ceiling," says the specialist in a conversation with Bankier.pl.
In his view, despite the strong inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to raise its rates in an environment where the vast majority of central banks mitigate policy.
"If the gold is properly measured, the euro quotations should continue in the coming months around the ceiling of PLN 4.35 - so the Polish bonds are not attractive to him.
Significantly more profitable than Polish papers offer bonds from emerging markets," says Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation to emerging markets in the company of UBS Wealth Management.
According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the economic downturn in the world.
"The global slowdown can grow even further, but there should not be a severe recession, but at the most, the GDP dynamics slightly below zero," says Michael Bolliger.
"Investors should underestimate global actions that may be detrimental to the lack of prospects for resolving the US-China conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including the Donald Trump impeachment procedure and Brexit.
Among the equity markets, Europe should be the least" is the latest letter to investors by the main manager of UBS Wealth Management Mark Haefele.
"The shares of the euro area countries should behave worse than the US, because they are more vulnerable under conditions of increased uncertainty around global trade and fear of slowing down," says the document.
According to Michael Bolliger, after a hossa in the bond markets of the safest countries pushed the profitability of German 10-year-olds to minus 0.74%, it is still possible to deepen the decline in profitability.
However, in the longer term, long-term securities should no longer be profitable, but only short-term ones, due to the mitigation of banks' monetary policy.
The Fed has the largest area for foot cuts, which should weaken the American currency in the coming years.
The long-term balance for euro quotations is a ceiling of USD 1.29, which would mean a 19-percent potential to strengthen the single currency to the dollar.
We expect further reductions in Fed rates, which will lead to a decline in monetary policy differences in the world.
"In order to maintain the strength of the dollar in the long term may not allow deficits in the current and budget account," says Michael Bolliger.
The Bundeswehr loses his weapon.
Confidential report of the German MON
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehr has reported the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 arms and 19 445 ammunition - a confidential statement drawn up in the Ministry of Defence of the Federal Republic of Germany.
The press belonging to the media group RedactionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND) provided the information.
According to a document from the Parliamentary Office of the Secretary of State at the MON Peter Tauber (CDU), two weapons, one piece of weapons and 3474 ammunition have so far been re-traced.
Among the military equipment still missing, there are, among others: six universal MG3 machine guns, 11 G3 automatic rifles, four G36 automatic rifles, six signal guns and two P8 guns.
In addition, 30 barrels for MG3 machine guns are missing.
The vice-president of the Left Party, Martin Renner, expressed concern about the situation.
As the RND journalists have said, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is "troublesome."
All the more so, as a result of the investigations, only a small part of the lost equipment was found.
Martina Renner summarized the effects of these actions as a "bad balance sheet."
She also criticised the fact that the statement does not indicate whether or not there is a weapon found in the investigation against Lieutenant Bundeswehra Franco A. In December 2017, Karlsruhe's federal prosecutor accused him of preparing a serious act of violence threatening the security of the state and violating the laws governing access to firearms.
The officer was accused of bombing leading German politicians with extremely right-wing and racist motives.
His "blacklist" of targets, which fell into the hands of the prosecutor's office, included Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, a human rights defender and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung Foundation in Berlin.
Franco A. illegally acquired four firearms, more than 1,000 ammunition and more than 50 explosives.
Crying babies on a plane.
How can we avoid them?
There's a solution.
Japan Airlines has recently used a function designed for people for whom travelling in the company of a crying child is a nightmare.
Through the website, the lines allow you to check the location distribution on the plane.
If a given connection travels to a minor until the second year of age, the "child icon" appears on a specific seat reserved by parents or carers.
Thus, the person using the carrier's services has the option to choose a place far away from that occupied by the little one.
The BBC reports that the lines have already reported the shortcomings of this solution.
The "child icon" will not appear when the ticket has been booked by a third party or if there has been a change of aircraft at the last minute.
As you would expect, the idea was shared by Internet users.
Some Twitter users indicate that the problem of travelling with crying children can be solved with noise reduction headphones.
They're kids. We used to be kids.
"We need to learn tolerance, because soon we will need a map of places sitting for breathable lips, drooling or drunkards," wrote G Sundar.
Another netizens noticed that he was once disturbed by crying children on a plane, but he changed his mind when he became a parent.
There is also a lack of supporters of the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.
"Thank you for warning me about screaming children on a 13-hour journey," wrote Rahat Ahmed.
Majorca counts losses after bankruptcy of travel agency Thomas Cook
More than 25 000 foreign tourists will not arrive in October for a holiday in Majorca as a result of the bankruptcy announced by Thomas Cook's travel agency on Monday.
According to a representative of the Autonomous Government of the Balearic Islands Marc Pons on Friday, among the 25,000 holidaymakers who will not be able to take part in the October holiday in Majorca, there are also people who would travel with companies indirectly associated with Thomas Cook, e.g. Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80% of the expected holidaymakers who, due to the bankruptcy of the UK company, had to give up their vacation in Majorca next month are German and Scandinavian citizens.
However, as Pons claims, as Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Balearic island during November-April, the losses to the local economy will be less.
He revealed that the Balearic government had already started negotiations with international operators on "entering the Majorca market" after the bankruptcy of the UK operator.
According to the estimates of the newspaper "Diario de Mallorca" in October, over 1,000 people will lose their jobs due to the tourist crisis in Majorca.
About 800 are the fired employees of Thomas Cook's office in Palma.
Other people will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, together with the announcement of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook in many Majorca hotels, the owners of the premises demanded that guests pay an additional fee for the accommodation.
This situation was experienced by several dozen tourists from Poland.
The Balearic Government estimates that by Thursday several dozen hotels in Majorca have ceased operations until at least the end of October in connection with the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook and its cooperating companies.
On the other hand, the Friday newspaper Diario de Ibiza indicates that the majority of hotels operating in Ibiza, which cooperated with the Thomas Cook group, are not expected to close in the coming weeks.
The newspaper reminds us that on this ballerina island, British bankrupt has been cooperating with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the autonomous Balearic authorities announced that they would ask the Spanish Government to support the region with EUR 100 million to cover losses caused by the bankruptcy announcement by Thomas Cook's travel agency.
They revealed that the most affected tourists on this archipelago, about 36 thousand people, are in Majorca.
According to data from the Balearic government, Thomas Cook is behind local tourism companies, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of agreements concerning the period July-September 2019 about EUR 5 million.
Women's FIFA ranking.
Poland still on 29th place, USA at the head
The female representation of Poland takes 29th place in the ranking of the International Football Federation (FIFA), published on Friday.
At the same position, the team of Coach Miłosz Stęstnieński was classified in the previous July compilation.
Weak team matches.
What's it gonna be like in October?
The leaders remained American women who recently defended the title of world champions.
The second place in the ranking was maintained by the Germans and the third remaining Dutch women.
The Polish are preparing for the qualification of ME.
They were supposed to start an away game with the Czechs on September 3rd.
The day before the meeting, because of food poisoning, it was postponed by a year.
In this situation, the Polish people will inaugurate their qualification with the Spanish on November 12 in Lublin.
Earlier, "White-Red" will play two sociable matches - on October 3rd with Cyprus and five days later in Kielce with Brazil.
In the group of Polish rivals there are representatives of Spain, the Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
Group winners and the top three teams from second places will be promoted directly to the final tournament.
The remaining six teams from second positions will play in the barracks for the last three passes to the European Championship.
16 participants will be completed by the host - England.
The male representation of Poland in the September FIFA ranking fell from 20th to 22nd place.
"Rz": Smog crushed the government
"The effects of the Clean Air program are slim, and coal furnaces will burn this winter as if nothing had ever happened," we read on the front page of today's "Rzeczpospolita".
"So far, 82 thousand applications have been submitted under the Clean Air Programme for funding with a total value of PLN 2 billion, of which 48 000 were positive.
The accepted applications amount to a total of over PLN 915 million," says "Rz," referring to the data from the Minister of the Environment.
According to the newspaper, only part of the costs incurred are reimbursed from the program.
The results of the announced noisy program are judged by the journal as "humble."
Self-governments, quoted by "Rz," are looking at the failure of "Clean Air" in, among others, too much bureaucracy.
"The programme should be much simpler: electronic notification, sending invoices by post, possible sampling of implementation.
This would improve actions," says Mayor Lidzbark Warminski Jacek Wiśniowski.
Activists from the Polish Smog Alarm notice that in the first year of the operation less than 1% of the intended purpose of replacing 3 million pots were realized.
As "Rz" notes, although the budget of the programme is PLN 103 billion for 10 years, i.e. annually PLN 10 billion, this amount is virtual.
"In the budget of the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management for this year, PLN 1.4 billion has been reserved," we read.
Congress agrees to F-35 for Poland
Błaszczak: Now negotiating prices
The US Congress agreed to sell Poland 32 state-of-the-art F-35 aircraft.
"This is one of the last steps before concluding the contract, but not the end of our work," wrote Mariusz Błaszczak on Twitter.
"We will negotiate hard to achieve the best possible price," added the Polish minister.
Contract for Polish F-35
The Polish air force is ultimately powered by 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters manufactured by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, the U.S. Department of State agreed to sell them to Poland.
The Communication stresses that investment will support national security and the US foreign policy by improving the security of NATO ally, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to the State Department, Poland is to pay $6.5 billion for the fighters.
However, this is not the final price.
The State Department indicated that the contract would also include the supply of spare and repair parts, training equipment, engineering, logistics and personnel services, and related elements of logistics support and program and staff training.
Lockheed Martin F-35 fighters
The F-35 Lightning II fighter produced by Lockheed Martin is a single-seater and single-engine 5th-generation multi-tasking fighter.
The aircraft is capable of carrying out close support missions, bombings and typically fighter aircraft combat tasks.
Thanks to the use of stealth technology, the fighter is undetectable for short-range radars.
Recently, F-35s bought Belgium under a contract worth $4.55 billion.
The Belgians want to replace them with the ageing F-16.
The purchase of American combat aircraft is also to be considered by other US allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Gender dolls
Barbie's producer introduced a series of sexually neutral dolls to the market.
It's how he wants to fight stereotypes.
Barbie's producer introduced a series of sexually neutral dolls on the market
Next to Barbie with different skin colors, figure or hairstyle, Mattel introduced sexually neutral dolls.
Toys from the Creatable World series wear wigs.
Children can therefore decide whether their Barbie should have short hair or long hair.
Their wardrobe consists of both trousers and dresses.
In the blink of an eye, dolls can become boys and vice versa.
They are also available in different colors of the skin and with different clothes.
The emphasis on gender characteristics was also given up - gender dolls no longer have full mouths, long eyelashes and thin waist or - in Ken's case - wide arms.
The company thinks that children don't like their dolls having imposed sexual standards, and some parents and feminists are convinced that toys made for a particular gender inhibit girls' ambitions and strengthen traditional stereotypes.
"New dolls will allow all children to feel free," announced Mattel.
Barbie's doll, which appeared on the market in 1959 in swimsuit and high heel shoes, has been repeatedly criticised in the past for promoting "unhealthy female stereotypes," such as the unnatural proportion of the body.
The company responded to criticism and has already introduced dolls of different colors and more rounded shapes.
There were also dolls in hijab.
Zandberg: wheel or club Together may have several Members
Zandberg asked on the ZET radio how many candidates of his party can get to the Sejm from the list of leftist groups (KW SLD from which the list starts candidates for the SLD Sejm, Spring and Left Together, starting with the common logo "Levia"), replied that it depends on the result of the committee.
"I believe that the result of the Left will be very good, because we feel that people have the hope that the Left is not only right, but also strong," he said.
According to Zandberg, the left may have 60-80 Members.
"This may mean that the circle or club together will have a dozen Members.
But it depends on Poles and Poles.
I'm not gonna guess and tell you how it's gonna happen," he said.
Questioned whether the Left Together would have a separate circle, Zandberg replied: "We have an agreement that we are diverse, and we will not pretend that there is no diversity.
I think that this diversity Poles have rewarded because we have shown that different, we have been able to agree on a common program."
Asked if the biggest beneficiary of the joint launch is SLD leader Włodzimierz Czarzasty, Zandberg replied that in his opinion the biggest beneficiaries are the centrolevic and left-wing voters.
In turn, to note that the SLD will receive the entire subsidy, he replied that "the purpose of the political party is to represent its constituents."
Zandberg admitted that he would vote for himself in the elections to the Sejm.
In the case of the Senate elections, he pointed out that he was wondering.
"The offer is diverse and there are candidates and candidates to whom my heart is closer, but there are also those to whom my heart is further," he said.
"But I will be very honest and clear that if I were in the 44th Senate district, I would take the electoral certificate and vote in another district," he stressed the politician.
"I don't think I'd be tempted to vote for Minister Kazimierz Ujazdowski (KO-PAP candidate) ," he added.
In this district outside Ujazdowski the leader of Polish citizens Paweł Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS are taking part.
Dakar: The largest mosque in West Africa opened
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered on Friday in the capital for the inauguration of a huge mosque, considered the largest in West Africa.
Muslims came by bus, car and walk to the Bopp district, where a new mosque stood, which could accommodate 30,000 believers.
The object was built by the Mouride Brotherhood, which belongs to the Sufi mainstream of Islam, which dominates Senegal.
Work on the mosque began ten years ago in a wet area of six hectares, transferred by the government.
The name of the mosque Massalikul Jinan ("Trails to Paradise") comes from the title of the poem of Sheik Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, a 19th-century founder of the brotherhood, worshiped by the followers as a saint.
The mosque is covered with Carrarian marble and has five minarets.
The highest of them is 78 meters.
The mosque inside will accommodate 15,000 faithful, and the other is likely to be on the outer esplanade.
In richly finished interiors you can admire the gold dome, giant chandeliers and handmade decorations by workers from Morocco.
The builders claim that the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but there is no comparison to mosques in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassan II mosque in Casablanca can accommodate 105 thousand faithful.
The construction of the mosque, which cost more than EUR 30 million, was financed from private donations.
The government, apart from the land, funded lighting, sanitary facilities and financed road works worth EUR 10.5 million.
Funny Coach: Our problem isn't Silesia, it's us.
Pass eight league matches without winning the Crown footballers will try to stop in a Friday meeting with the Vice-President of the Silesian Extraclasse.
"Our problem is not Wroclaw, but ourselves, we have to work on what we play," emphasized Kielce Coach Mirosław Smyła.
The Crown players last and so far the only victory in the league was recorded in the first line when they defeated 1-0 of the Częstochowa Raków games on their way out.
Later, Kielce scored two draws and six failures, and on Tuesday they lost 0:1 to Zagłęg Lubin in the 1/32 finals of the Polish Cup.
"It makes me so optimistic that, in the last seconds of the Cup game, the footballers were fighting for the goal, they wanted to draw a tie.
Their fall on the turf after the last whistle was not due to a breakdown, it was only a fall of anger, because they were so close," said Smyła.
As he pointed out, Silesia has very strong wings, so he will be allergic to playing in the side sectors of the field.
"We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we also look at what we want to play," added the coach.
In Friday's match in the Crown he will certainly not play a pause for the excess yellow cards Ognjen Gnjatic, in the frame there will also be a shortage of injured Jakub Żubrowski and Michael Gardawski.
It is very encouraging, however, to report to the Cup match of several players with pleasure to play.
"We have a headache, recently it seemed that he wouldn't be there, and now he is," he said.
Crown defender Daniel Dziwniel emphasized that Silesia will not be an easy rival to break the streak of eight league games in a row without winning, while in the Extraclass everyone can win against everyone.
"We're a good team.
In recent weeks we may not show it on the field, but the moment will come that we will win and we believe it will be on Friday," said the football player.
After nine queues of the Crown's extraclass with five points, it takes 15th place.
Silesia gathered 12 more and placed second place.
The Friday game in Kielce will start at 8:30 p.m.
These trees can completely disappear from Europe
"42 per cent of tree species in Europe are at risk" warns the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) on Friday's "Red Book of European Trees."
The list includes chestnuts and hawks.
IUCN, an organisation based in Gland, Switzerland, publishes the list of endangered species of European trees for the first time.
It was developed by specialists who, on the basis of research, concluded that of the 454 species of trees present in Europe (and elsewhere in the world) 42% are "highly at risk'.
Among the causes, the Red Paper mentions the rapid expansion of urban agglomerations and global climate change.
However, the most vulnerable are those trees and shrubs that occur only or mainly on our continent.
As far as typically European stands are concerned, according to experts from IUCN 58 percent of species are at risk, and 15 percent, i.e. 66 species of trees and shrubs, are threatened with extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Paper lists errors in the operation of the stand, accelerated urbanisation, too intense logging, followed by forest fires and changes in the European ecostytem.
According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, mosses and lichens is also at great risk.
"The aftermath of human activity leads to the gradual disappearance of European plant species and creates the risk of extinction of important and underestimated varieties in Europe, which form the basis of European ecosystems and have an impact on the health of our planet," concluded the report by Luc Bas, which runs the European IUCN office.
Grzegorz Schetyna: I won't promise 600+
"Today, PiS wants to bribe Poles by offering them freedom to spend on credit, which will have to pay off future generations," says Grzegorz Schetyn in an interview for "Rzeczpospolita."
In his opinion, "the whole policy of PiS is pic."
At the same time, the politician promises that "what is given will not be taken."
Schetina assures in a conversation with Jack Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea to defeat Law and Justice.
It's about mobilizing the electorate at the polls.
In his opinion, the opposition has more potential in this regard than Kaczyński's party.
"Today's conscious people who want to live in a normal country are more than those who support the PiS, a party who has embezzled the values proclaimed, such as modesty, humility, transparency," says Schetyna.
The leader of the Civic Coalition and the President of the Civic Platform also highlighted the basic principles of the KO electoral programme.
"First of all, nothing that is given will be received, but it is necessary to set a direction for the future, because PiS only deals with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which can be seen even after dramatically low investments," he said.
Secondly, it is about "launching the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work honestly - and those who are entrepreneurial."
Schetyna explains that the KO program included a project which will give the least earning Poles more about 614 zlotys per hand and more to the earners - also several hundred.
Politics also pointed out that he didn't want to race for distribution.
Like he said, he'll do as much as he can, but he won't promise 600+.
"I will never allow the Greek option, where the rulers were bidding with the opposition to the distribution, until the country's financial collapse finally occurred," he stressed.
Schetyna in an interview with "Rz" also stated that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
"We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.
"Pride walks before the fall.
Kaczyński is as statesman as Banas is crystal," he added.
The leader of the PO also said that he had not yet decided whether he would apply for the leadership of the Platform.
Argentina: Six dead giant condors
Six dead giant condors were found in the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, reports TVN24.
Specialists believe that human activity contributed to their deaths.
The big condors were probably poisoned with a means to kill predators such as pumas, foxes, and wild dogs.
The animals could have eaten a toxic carcass.
Except for one young man, the rest of the dead condors were grown up.
"It's a great loss to the environment because the condor must reach 10-15 years in order to become fertile and capable of reproduction.
So we lose the protected species, the endangered species," says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentinean environmental organisation.
"I think that using toxic bait and poison puts not only this species at risk, but all other life forms, including human health," he adds.
"Rz": They want a jewel for the president
Work has begun on granting the head of the precious chain to the state.
The idea was supported by Andrzej Duda - we read in "Rzeczpospolita."
As the newspaper explains, it is about the golden chain of the Order of the White Eagle, the royal insignium officially called in the interwar period the jewel of the Republic.
It's probably the last time President Ignacy Mościcki used it.
"Rz" says that soon such a chain can reach Andrew Duda's arms.
The Senate Committee on Human Rights, Rule of Law and Petitions voted on Wednesday to work on amending the Law on Awards and Awards in order to restore it.
The journal writes that this is not the first attempt to restore this chain of head of state.
The Senate has already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it is lost in one voice.
This time the work is instant.
At the beginning of August, the senators took a few minutes to consider that they would consult the President's Office.
This one came in mid-September.
"I kindly inform you that the Polish President's Office does not comment on the position put forward in this petition," wrote President Andrzej Dera.
On Wednesday, the Senate Committee continued the matter and again spent little time on the matter.
"The President's Office responded briefly: "He is in favour of bringing it back," said the head of the commission Robert Mamotov of PiS, quoted by "Rz."
He proposed that legislative work be undertaken, which the committee supported.
Cops will teach drivers how to drive through the crossroads
The police action will be conducted, among others, at the intersection of Cieplińskiego al. from Piłsudskiego al.
Uniform activities are, in effect, related to recent complaints by city authorities about drivers who are not always able to behave properly at the intersection.
On Friday, September 27th, police officers begin preventive action in Rzeszow "Transmissive crossings."
It is about eliminating obstacles in traffic: entering the intersection without the possibility of exiting, not complying with light signals or road signs.
"We often think we're alone at the crossroads, but we're actually making life difficult for other drivers," said Marek Ustrobinski, vice president of the city a few days ago.
His words sounded at the press conference of the town hall, where the city authorities presented examples of inappropriate movement of cars at intersections, which resulted in traffic jams.
At that time, the president appealed to travelers for reasonableness on the road and, among other things, faster moving on traffic lights or not texting while driving.
The subject was, as it were, taken over by the crowd police, who are starting today's "Transmissive Crossroads" action.
What is it?
The aim of the action is to eliminate the phenomenon of congestion at intersections by drivers entering them without the possibility of continuing driving.
It's a common offense that contributes to increasing obstacles in traffic and creating traffic jams.
A mandate of PLN 300 and 2 criminal points is at risk.
In addition, uniforms will pay attention to non-compliance with light signals or road signs and incorrect parking in the intersection area.
They will also observe the lack of fluidity of driving, late movement from the beacons, slow crossings and leaving too much distance between vehicles.
At what intersections will the actions be carried out?
Lisa-Kuli from Jagiellońska Street; Cieplińskiego from Piłsudskiego Street; Targowa from Piłsudskiego Street; Śreniawitów Square from Dąbrowskiego Street or Hetmańska Street from Warsaw Uprisings Al.
Such actions in the capital of Podkarpacie will be held on the next Fridays of October.
They checked out the waste disposal company from "Kaika"
"The officials of the Department of Environmental Protection of the Wołomiński County and the District Inspection of Construction Supervision inspected the installation in Zielonka commune on Friday, where waste from the sewage treatment plant "Czajka" in Warsaw is disposed of," said Karol Szyszko, spokesperson of the Old Town of Wołomiński.
Inspectors from the Vołomińskie region carried out an inspection at an establishment located in the forests belonging to the municipality of Zielonka.
Private Commercial and Transport Plant "Dar-Trans", under contract with the Capital Waste Water Treatment Plant "Tchajka" provides services for the management of waste dumps.
"The installation was inspected, and the entrepreneur was asked to provide documentation related to his activities," said Szyszko.
He added that the audit report will be submitted, among others, to the Provincial Environmental Protection Supervisor in Warsaw.
The last check in "Dar-Trans" was carried out by the Provincial Environmental Protection Inspectorate in Warsaw between 29 December 2015 and 11 February 2016.
It was then found that the company did not carry out sampling, measurement and testing of groundwater and did not have the results of studies of stabilised municipal sewage sludges from the sewage treatment plant "Tchayka'.
After the visit, Dariusz Saturday was called upon to stop violating the terms of the decision.
The Private Trade and Transport Plant "DAR-TRANS" Dariusz Sobota is one of the companies receiving waste in the form of stabilised municipal sewage sludges from the "Tchajka" treatment plant.
According to the decision to carry out waste disposal on the site of the excavation site, waste up to 60,000 tonnes per year is processed in forests near Zielonka.
The Warsaw City Water and Sewerage Company informed last Thursday that at the turn of November and December 2018 the plant was shut down, which was related to the damage to one of the incinerator devices.
According to MPWiK, the monthly cost of their exports is PLN 1.7 million (calculated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Wałęsa supported Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
"You have taken up a difficult task, you can count on my full support," said Lech Wałęsa to Margaret Kidawa-Błońska on Friday.
"Mr President, for me these are very important words," said the candidate of the Civic Coalition to the Prime Minister, the leader of the KO list in Warsaw.
The former president emphasized that as far as the situation in Poland is concerned, he is now "only a retired fan."
Margaret Kidawa-Błońska met with former President Lech Wałęsa in his office at the European Solidarity Centre in Gdańsk on Friday.
The son of Wałęsa, Jarosław, took part in a brief conversation behind closed doors.
"You took up a difficult task," he said after meeting Lech Wałęsa.
"You can count on my full support," he added.
"The problems before Poland are known to us all.
Therefore, it is a great hope that you, as a woman, will cope with these problems, and we all - those who love Poland - will support your actions as much as possible" said the former President, addressing Kidawa-Błońska.
Very important words
Kidawa-Błońska thanked for her support.
"Mr President, these are very important words to me, because no one like you can talk about freedom, about the constitution and knows how important this is," she said.
"Let's show that you can do a different, smart policy, together, but according to the constitution, according to the law, according to respect for others.
This is what you did for your revolution, and we want to change Poland," emphasized Kidawa-Błońska.
Retired fan
Wałęsa in a conversation with journalists said that he is now "only a retired fan."
"Of course I'm looking into it.
I hope that we reverse the course of events, that what was good, checked, (to this) we will return.
The three divisions of power are the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are necessary.
And all of this needs to be cleaned out, and all of this needs to be restored to normal action, and that's what I believe we're going to do this time.
'Cause if you don't, we're gonna have a street test," said Lech Walesa.
"That's why it's so important that Poles go to elections, think about it and make their own decisions.
And that's the most important thing" she threw in Kidawa-Błońska.
"The last chance that with a card we will improve the state of things in Poland," the former president replied.
"We must build a new foundation"
Asked about the most important changes that should take place in Poland, Kidawa-Błońska said: "The President said very well.
We need to build a new foundation on which we can do all the other things.
Since the three divisions of power do not exist, since the constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and make it obvious and so that everyone knows that otherwise Poland will not go any further."
ME volleyball players: Slovenia - Poland 3:1 in the semi-finals.
In the hot area in Ljubljana, Polish volleyball players fought with the Slovenians in the semi-finals of the European Championship.

The Senate decided on key laws
The Senate adopted without amendment the Law on the disclosure of the family assets of the most important civil servants and on the flights of the most important persons in the State.
52 senators voted in favour of the amendment of the Law on the wealth of families of government officials - without amendments - 14 against, three abstentions.
Thus, the senators decided to reject 12 amendments tabled during the Wednesday debate by Senator Po Sławomir Rybicki.
According to him, the amendments had to "civilise" the law and limit the scope of information given in the declaration on the property situation of own children, the children of the spouse, children adapted to cases where children remain in the common household with the person obliged to make the declaration.
The Law on the transparency of family assets of the most important government officials, whose project was created at the Prime Minister's office, was adopted by the Sejm on 11 September.
The legislation assumes that, among other things, prime ministers, ministers, MEPs, senators, presidents: Constitutional Court, Supreme Administrative Court and Supreme Court, as well as persons headed by other state institutions, will be required to include in the property statement information on the personal property of spouses, children and persons living together.
Nor did the Senate propose amendments to the Law on Flights of the Most Important Persons in the State.
It regulates what flights have the status of HEAD and who can be on board government aircraft with the most important persons in the country.
The Act also specifies who is responsible for keeping the Central Register of Flights.
The law - without amendments - was supported by 55 senators, 12 against, four abstentions.
According to the bill, every president's flight will be a "official mission" flight.
The President will be allowed to accompany family members and others invited by the President.
On the other hand, the flight of the official Prime Minister and the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate will be only a flight "take place to carry out tasks directly related to the function."
The Act also clarifies the list of persons who can accompany the most important persons in the country during the flight.
According to the regulations, members of the delegation may be on board the aircraft - invited Members, Senators, representatives of public authorities and experts; persons providing technical, medical or organisational services; as well as journalists.
According to the Act, in the event of doubts concerning the flights of the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate, the head of the KPRM will ask for clarification.
If such doubts are not clarified within the prescribed time, the head of the NAP will be obliged to notify the heads of the Sejm or Senate of the lack of possibility of organising such a flight.

After the first training in Paris, Poles are waiting for their last rival
Polish volleyball players held their first training in Paris on Friday, where they will perform in the match for a bronze medal on Saturday.
Vital Heynen's charge of winning the title closed Thursday's defeat with the Slovenians 1:3 in Ljubljana.
It was loud about their trouble traveling to that duel.
This time there were no such problems - on Friday morning they went with the Slovenians on a charter to Paris, and a few hours later they took training at the famous Bercy Hall.
According to the classmates, the trainer of the world champions was upset.
As Heynena Michał Mieszko Gogol's assistant pointed out, this time the main task was not just to exercise volleyball elements.
"We went to the hall, but mostly it was time for the band.
It was about spending more time together than training.
To talk, to think about how to rebuild it all as a team," he reported.
He confirmed that the semi-final defeat was a painful lesson for both the players and the training staff.
"We were brutally brought to earth.
There's no question we're disappointed.
We still believed we'd get back to this game.
We were discussing this game with each other at the staff, coach was talking to a lot of players.
As the two main causes of failure, I would point to inefficiencies in the attack and much worse than usual dealing with situational balls.
The Slovenians were much better than us in this respect," he analyzed.
In his opinion, "White-Red" was not prevented by the stress associated with the performance against the loud and numerous audiences of the co-hosts of the tournament.
He admitted that the world champions might have put the smooth way to the semifinals a little bit.
"Perhaps if we had failed in a similar way in the group phase, we would have analyzed the lesson more quickly and later we would have played in the later stages of the tournament.
But it's only if you're not," he warned.
Gogol hopes that the anger associated with Thursday's defeat by Poles will be able to turn into aggression in the bronze game.
"I hope we show our true face then.
There's something to fight about.
We recently won an ME medal in 2011", he recalled.
Paris is the fifth city, and France is the third country visited by Poles during these championships.
In the group phase they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, for the first two meetings of the group they went to Apeldoorn, and to the semi-finals they moved to Ljubljana.
Nick Kyrgios: severe punishment but suspended
Australian tennis player received a 16-week ban on take-offs and a fine of $25,000 - six months suspended - for reprehensible words, gestures and actions during the last ATP tournaments.
ATP World Tour activists lose patience with Kyrgios, but they still give him a chance to improve.
A summary of the transgressions of the most uncouth professional tennis player in recent years looks dangerous - 16 weeks breaks plus a large fine, but both penalties are suspended for six months - a trial period in which a wayward athlete will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but has been messing with the world's tennis record for a long time - he had to pay the highest single financial penalty in the history of discipline for breaking the rules of behavior on the court and next to it.
Loud curses, strange gestures, unsporting behavior, insulting the judge and viewers, breaking two rockets during a lost match with Karen Chachanov - for all this after August's ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati paid 113 thousand dollars.
In the US Open 2019 he didn't play long, but he had time to publicly say that the ATP activists "are corrupt" which hurt the organization's authorities so much that they implemented a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks they gave the said verdict on the suspension of take-offs and the next fine.
However, the words about corruption were forgiven, after hearing the blamed one and learning the context of the statement.
However, in the explanatory memorandum, tennis activists indicated that the investigation showed that Kyrgios' behaviour over the past 12 months in many cases raised serious objections and constituted almost a constant violation of the rules, that he continually insulted people associated with tournaments and viewers, hence the high penalty.
However, the ATP gave him five days to file the appeal and immediately postponed the execution of the judgment by ordering that within the next six months a few conditions be fulfilled: in the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgios, there is no longer any way to violate the rules of conduct of professional tennis players, in particular, it cannot curse, destroy rockets, argue with judges and the public, or behave indecently and vulgarly.
He was also recommended to seek "continuous support" from mental trainers during tournaments and also outside the season to consult with people specializing in solving the problems of athletes who are not coping with proper behaviour.
The first comment (on social media) of Nick Kyrgios to the verdict was: "Hey, everybody, I can still play.
I just need to control my behavior, that's all."
In practice, the Australian will have a break of at least two weeks, as Lavera's Cup suffered a severe shoulder injury, so he had to give up the nearest start in Beijing (30 September - 6 October) and Shanghai (6-13 October).
In the ATP Kyrgios ranking it takes 27th place.
This year he won two tournaments - in Washington and Acapulco, he earned more than 1.3 million dollars, so even after fines he will have a lot left.
GUS: Poland is getting better and better
According to a report published by the CSO on Friday on household budgets, as a good or rather good material situation was estimated by as many as 44 percent of them.
A year earlier, this percentage was 37.2 percent, 33.5 percent in 2016, and earlier, since 2009, when the statistical office first examined subjective household situation assessments, it never exceeded 30%.
A total of 8.1 per cent of households considered their material situation to be bad or rather bad, compared to 11.2 per year earlier and over 20 per cent in 2009.
The best is the material situation of households of self-employed workers.
In this group, more than 70% of respondents consider it good or rather good.
At the second pole there are Rentist households, where the percentage of such responses was only 18%.
The number of children also has a significant impact on the subjective assessment of the household's material situation.
The worst is for single parents who raise their offspring, of whom 32 percent declare a good or rather good material situation.
Among couples with children, this percentage varies (depending on the number of children) from 55 to 60%, and among childrenless households is 48.8%.
The effect of the 500+ programme is clearly visible in these statistics.
Before it was launched (in 2016) the worst of its material situation was assessed by single parents raising children and large families (with at least three children).
Improving subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles is a reflection of the rapid growth of income, mainly from work.
However, that is not all, because the percentage of households that they consider to be good increases faster than real income.
Moreover, at the level of voivodships there is no clear correlation between income levels and the assessment of household material conditions.
The best grades are formulated by the inhabitants of the Opolskie Voivodship, where 48.9% of the respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.
There are also Lubuskie Voivodships (47.7%), Śląskie (47.3%), Mazowieckie (47.3%), and Zachodniopomorskie (47.1%).
In Opole, however, the disposable income (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) was less than 94% of the national average in the previous year and 98% in Lubusek.
The highest income was the inhabitants of Mazowiecki (120 per cent of the national average) and Silesian (104 per cent).
On average in Poland the disposable income per person amounted to PLN 1693 in 2018.
In real terms (after adjustment for the impact of price changes) increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.
Against the background of previous years, it's a pretty low score.
In 2016, income per person increased by 7% and one year later by 6.3%.
Although revenue growth slows down, it also inhibits expenditure growth.
These per person amounted to PLN 1187 in the previous year, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.
This is the first such case since 2013.
In 2017, expenditure per person increased by 1.9% in real terms and by 4.3% in 2016 in real terms.
Household budget surveys suggest that the household currently spends 70.1 per cent of its disposable income, while in 2014 the share was above 80% and by 2006 exceeded 90%.

USA: Three suicides among carrier crew
Three sailors committed suicide on board the USS George H. W. Bush ship last week, reported the U.S. Navy.
In the last two years, five crew members of this ship have been killed in total.
The previous suicide took place in July this year and earlier in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors shot themselves last week.
Each incident occurred on land when the USS George H. W. Bush moored off the coast of the state of Virginia.
So far, third parties have been excluded from the case.
Moreover, death is not to be linked.
"We need everyone involved in presenting suggestions and ideas on how we can prevent another suicide.
I would like to stress that there is no stigmatisation or other repercussions related to the search for help," wrote Captain Sean Bailey, the ship's commander on Facebook.
Niesiołowski critically about the Pope.
John Paul II did nothing
In a conversation with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesiołowski emphasized that in 1981 John Paul II was a huge authority for opposition activists.
"Actually, every sentence he said was acceptable."
Later, some of his actions were criticized.
"For me, that John Paul II could not eliminate the harmful activity of Rydzyk, puts a great shadow on his pontificate.
After all, this redemptorist - a pest of the Church and Poland - developed his media into the best in the life of the Polish Pope," he explained.
Former politician PO admitted: "There were rumors of discontent, the Pope said something, once Rydzyka did not accept, but had power and for politics he could simply throw him out of the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor.
However, John Paul II did not do it, similarly his successors" explained Niesiołowski.
"In addition, this fatal case of pedophilia and the Church's actions, or, in fact, their absence, has come to pass.
I thought a little ahead, but I wanted to draw attention to his whole life.
We have known about the scale of pedophilia in the Church since relatively recently.
The question arises as to how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting things," he says in a conversation with journalist Niesiołowski.
The Polish Church is an ally of the PiS.
"We must admit that during the Solidarity period the Church was our most important ally.
All the celebrations began with the Holy Mass, there were crosses everywhere.
Now these crosses are written, they have become a symbol of dictatorship - a sign of the writing regime.
I repeat: one of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk shake the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing about it and that today the Church is an ally of the PiS.
It is a black chapter of the Polish Church, for which he will pay dearly" - was persuaded by Niesiołowski.
"I hope that Pope Francis chased Jędraszewski, Rydzyk and a few others of this kind," he concluded.

Disqualified griffin
The start within the Polish Cup between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gdańsk almost ended tragically when the goalkeeper of the opposing team, Zlatana Alomerovica, fired by fans from Wejherów by millimeters, passed by.
After this incident, the game was interrupted for 20 minutes.
The PZPN committee investigating this case has severely punished Gryph, excluding him from future games.
The club will not be able to compete in the Polish Cup in the season 2020/2021.
In addition, fans will not be allowed in the next game at their own stadium.
They won't be able to go to league games until December 31st either.
The burglars at the stadium Widzewa Łódź also caused fans of Silesia Wrocław.
Here, however, the PZPN judgment was milder, because Silesia warned that similar events could occur and was allergic to the relevant authorities in this matter.
Nevertheless, the services allowed the Łódź fans to be thrown at the sector with flares, torch chairs and to push the host sector.
This game was interrupted for eight minutes, and the intervening police had to use a water cannon.
PZPN punished Silesia with a one-off stadium ban in the next match in the Polish Cup and banned departures to the matches in this and the next edition of PP.
Extraklasa league matches were also banned, but there it will last until 31 December.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
The GDDKiA plans to exchange labelling across the managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Rezeszów
In Podkarpacie the revision of the regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure has begun on, among others, the registration of names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish.
For example, "Lions" will appear next to "L'viv."
In our voivodship changes will be made on 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear it, it's easier, easier to read and easier.
The new guidelines result from the amendment of the Minister of Infrastructure's regulation on detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety equipment.
"We should remember that the names of the localities in neighbouring countries are often also Polish.
Thanks to our change in the law, they will finally appear on the signposts on our roads.
The introduction of the new marking begins with the Podkarpackie section of the A4 motorway," informed the Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk.
In Podkarpacie, the changes will be made on 94 road signs set by the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total investment cost?
200,000 PLN.
The new label will first be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is planned by 1 November 2019.
What's the idea going to look like?
It will be done without replacing the plates, on the basis of stickers.
They will replace the existing names of the village with new ones written in Polish on existing signs.
Both names will be saved in one row - first in Polish and then in original, parentheses.
This will make it very easy for people who do not know the spelling of foreign cities in the language of the country in which they are located.

Someone shot a swan out of a windbreaker.
In the Zamcze pond in Lower Silesia, the inhabitants noticed a swan with wings problems.
After fishing and visiting the vet, it turned out that someone had set a target for the animal - a shotgun from the windpipe was found in his body.
"Information about the wounded bird was received from the villagers of the Wild Animal Rehabilitation Centre in Nowa Sól.
According to the report, the animal had broken wings.
We went to the scene.
You could see right away that there was something very wrong with him.
We acted quickly and precisely so as not to harm him or put him under any additional stress.
The swan was caught and taken to the vet.
After the first X-ray, it was known that someone had made a target out of him.
In his body there were pieces of buckwheat," says Marcin Walasek, CEO of Malpol company managing, among others, a rehabilitation center.
He'll winter at the resort.
"The wounds were cleaned, the bird was given antibiotics, water was provided, a safe place in the resort where he would spend the whole winter.
We're trying to strengthen him.
He can't fly right now.
Leaving him now would imply that he probably wouldn't survive the winter," adds Walasek.
The staff after rehabilitating the swan intend to release him to the same pond in the spring.
The authorities of the municipality of Żukowice, after receiving information about the cause of the animal's ill health, intend to inform the prosecution of the case.
The incident occurred in Zamcza
Gowin: "We must stimulate Polish small trade"
"The effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade," said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, leader of the Jarosław Gowin Agreement on Friday.
Gowin, during the conversation in "Signals of the Day" in Radio One, stated that trade is controlled by international networks that impose low margins on Polish producers that Polish companies cannot grow.
Given that this problem is very difficult to fight, the Deputy Prime Minister recalled that the PiS government tried to deal with it at the very beginning of its term of office, but got a "contrast from the EC's side."
"We have won before the tribunal of justice and I hope that if the United Right wins the next election and formulates the government, we will return to this topic," he said.
At the same time, he pointed out that "effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish, that is, small trade."
"This will have to be considered whether the government, the state, has some instruments to stimulate Polish trade," said Gowin.
In May, the EU court decided that the European Commission had made a mistake in recognising that the Polish retail tax was illegal public aid.
The Retail Tax Act provided for the introduction of two rates of trade tax: 0.8 percent on revenue between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4 percent on revenue above PLN 170 million per month.
The tax was to apply from September 2016.
In September 2016, the EC opened proceedings for violation of EU law by Poland.
Brussels then argued that the construction of the tax could favour smaller shops, which could be considered as public aid.
It further concluded that the tribute had been implemented unlawfully.
It also issued an injunction to suspend the application of the tax until its analysis was completed by officials in Brussels.
Poland disagreed with this position, but tax collection was suspended.
The EU Court's May decision opened the way for a re-introduction of the tax, but it did not finish the case.
On 24 July, the Commission lodged an appeal before the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the TSUE press services informed PAP that the case is currently at a written stage where both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.
It is not yet known whether and when the oral procedure, namely hearing the parties and possible hearing, will begin.
It takes a good few to a dozen months from the appeal to pronounce a judgment.
"This procedure lasts on average a year," said PAP source in the Luxembourg Court.
How to dress a child for baptism?
We offer some practical solutions
Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of the infant and his parents.
It is often the first occasion for the whole family to focus on the child, celebrating his appearance in the world together.
No wonder the newly baked mom and dad want their children to look their best on that day.
However, before you make the final decision about the child's costume, consider whether it will also be comfortable.
In shops you can find many costume sets that do not provide the little guy with proper comfort.
What, then, should we pay attention to?
The primary criterion for choosing a dress for baptism is the age of a child.
Until recently, a few weeks later, small ones were baptized, dressed in white sets and put into the same bets or big pillows.
Today, children who join the sacrament are often older: several months, one year or more.
It is not hard to imagine that such a great comfort needs a slightly different dress for baptism.
So if your child is 3-4 months old on the day of baptism, he will probably spend the ceremony in a wheelchair or in the hands of parents or godparents.
The best way to do that is to dress him up in comfortable cotton sleeping bags or sets.
Although this clothing element is considered a daily costume, it is enough to search for its festive variants, such as frill or lace.
For a boy, a body with a bow tie and harness will be perfect.
In the case of older children, you can afford to have more fantasy in your clothes.
The girl will look lovely in a simple tulle dress
Many parents of longing girls look towards richly decorated, falbanian baptism dresses in a set with coats, bands and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, non-breathing materials in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
In search of the right outfit, it will be better to look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant outfits on cotton lining.
Gentle tulle skirts, satin dresses, laces, apps and lovely sets will make your little girl look beautiful and comfortable.
Perfect outfit for a little gentleman: cotton suit
Until recently, there was fashion among boys' parents for suits that were a copy of "adult" models.
The polyester jackets and trousers, stiff collars and jackets often made young elegants show their dissatisfaction loudly.
Today, fortunately, they were replaced by comfortable cotton sets.
Just look at the sets available in Asanti for Kids, i.e. soft, sweatpants, and a top decorated in front of the vest pattern.
These outfits look extremely festive, yet they do not embarrass the movements of the little man who knows the world.
Krystyna Pawłowicz published a statement of property
Krystyna Pawłowicz made a statement of property at the end of her term of office.
It shows that the PiS Member has collected 110 thousand PLN of savings.
Let us remind you that Pavłowicz announced that she would resign from politics.
At the end of his term, he has the amount of PLN 110 thousand.
According to the statement made by the Member, she receives a monthly pension of PLN 4.7 thousand.
Pawłowicz has an apartment worth PLN 570 thousand and a slightly smaller one, which he rents by downloading PLN 880 per month.
The Member also invests in industrial metals, estimating the investment for 150 thousand PLN.
Formerly, Jarosław Kaczyński also published a statement of property.
Voting on adjournment at the Conservative Party Conference
The British parliamentarians voted against the three-day break in the House of Commons during the annual Conservative Party programme conference, which was requested by the government.
289 Members voted against - 306.
Ordinaryly, the House of Commons does not sit at party conferences so that Members do not have to give up either their participation in them or Parliament meetings.
However, the opposition parties considered that, at such a crucial time as the last weeks before Britain's exit from the European Union on 31 October, Parliament should not stop its deliberations.
The government's request for a break was supported by 289 Members, against 306.
Two opposition parties after the Conventions
The refusal to allow a break may be perceived as a political revenge against the opposition at Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday the decision was declared illegal and non-existent by the Supreme Court) and for not wanting to apologize after the judge's ruling.
After this decision, the Chamber of Commons resumed its session on Wednesday, and the most important event of the day was Johnson's speech and the following turbulent debate.
Johnson accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding early elections.
"It's time to complete the Brexit.
It must be implemented in order to respect the outcome of the referendum.
Brexit must come so that we can deal with a contract on citizens' priorities, on health care, on the cost of living.
Brexit must be realized so that we can unite this country," said Johnson.
The Conservative Party Conference is due to begin in Manchester next Sunday and will run until Wednesday 2 October.
Conferences of two main opposition groups - the Labour Party and Liberal Democrats - have already taken place.
One of the reasons that Johnson gave explaining this long suspension of Parliament was the party conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
"President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders," writes foreign media.
The President's spokesperson has strongly condemned these reports.
"That's just not true," he tweeted Blaze Spychalski.
Israeli media, including "Haaretz" and "Jerusalem Post," refer to "Jewish Insider," say that Andrzej Duda, during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora at the Polish Consulate in New York, declared that Israel was responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The president said that the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland was a response to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to the words of Israeli foreign minister Israel Katz, who stated in February that "the Poles sucked anti-Semitism with the milk of mothers."
Andrzej Duda said he regretted not apologizing for the humiliating statements of his politicians.
He also mentioned the act of aggression against Polish ambassador in Israel Marek Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by an assailant who shouted, "Polish Pole."
"The quote is not only inaccurate.
It's just not true," he tweeted Blaze Spychalski.
He emphasized that Duda "never said that Israel was responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland."
According to Spychalski, the portal "it invented."
According to the "JI" callers during the meeting there was also a dispute between the Holocaust survivor, awarded the Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was to agree with President Duda's words and say that Jews from Israel "such as Israel Kac" are responsible for the rise of anti-Semitism.
According to the sources of the Boteach portal, Mosberg was to be interrupted.
Who's Banas and what's his fault?
Rented by tenants of the tenant led the journalist to discover negligence in Marian Banasia's property statements.
We are summing up another incident that shocked the government camp.
TVN journalists have revealed that Marian Banaś, President of the Supreme Audit Chamber, has not written into the property statement of a 400-metre-long tenement house in Kraków Podgórze.
What's more, his sublet had sex business in the mentioned building (i.e. rent rooms per hour).
On the other hand, the building itself was allegedly a guarantee for the repayment of the loan since 2016.
Bertold Kittel's "Supervisioner" programme drew attention to the irregularities.
The reporter revealed that Banas had rented a tenement house with people connected to the criminal world to use it as a place for "sex reunions."
The clients were supposed to be men using prostitutes.
Banas responded vaguely and vaguely to the allegations.
Interestingly, a tenant rented by tenants led the journalist to discover negligence in Banasi's property statements.
The tenement itself was described vaguely in them, and the income from its rental was to be lowered.
"The property of Marian Banasia and his wife could be worth PLN 6 to 8 million.
In total, the spouses can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings [...]," writes Money.pl.
According to the analysis of the portal, Banasia's tenement itself was already worth about PLN 3 million.
The Central Anti-corruption Office is currently conducting control of Marian Banasia's property statements for the years 2015-2019.
Banas announced that by the time it was completed he would suspend his activities at NIK. "I will present to you marshals for free leave," he assured.
The opposition demands an explanation.
"We do not hear the CBA expanding its investigation or speeding up the examination of Marian Banasia's property statements.
That is why we are forced to deliver on the authorities of the state and to make a notification of the possibility of committing a crime [...]," said Mr Po-KO Mariusz Witczak.
"If a normal Pole so grossly valued the rental of his property, he would have already had 10 checks, tax supplements and criminal-treasure proceedings," he added.
He went high, he fell low.
Marian Banas is the new president of the Supreme Auditorium.
He was appointed to this post on 30 August 2019 for a 6-year term.
Its candidacy was put forward by the Law and Justice and by the votes of the politicians of this party.
Previously Banas was associated with NIK in 1992-2005. He worked in this institution as a collaborator of Lech Kaczyński.
During PiS's first reign (2005-2008), Banas served as President of the Customs Service and also as Undersecretary of State at the Ministry of Finance.
Since 2015, he has been again in charge of the Head of Customs Service and since 2017 he has been managing the National Tax Administration.

Graphic cards can now weigh a lot, and that naturally makes room for categories of products that would be vain to look for on store shelves just a decade ago.
This is the solution - the holder for the ELV8 RGB graphics card - presented by Cooler Master.
The new grip model for the graphics card is not only a functional solution to keep the graphics card more secure without relying solely on the strength of the PCI-express slot.
Cooler Master ELV8 RGB also has an additional task - decorative.
"Rzeczpospolita": Ignorance of a police officer's orders will be punished
According to the newspaper, disregarding a policeman's order for certain conduct is to be a new type of offence, threatened with fines, arrests, or restrictions on freedom.
This is what police union workers want to make.
The idea went to the Parliament's Committee on Petitions.
"The case is serious, because already every year more than half a million criminal cases go to Polish courts," we read.
"Rzeczpospolita" has determined that the petition that the Independent Police Union is writing to Members on the revision of the Code of Offences has a chance of success.
The petitioners propose a new wording of Article 54a of the Code of Offences.
It would read: "Whoever does not submit to the request or order of a public officer, issued within the limits and under the provisions of the law, shall be punishable by imprisonment, fine or restriction of liberty."
"Par. 3 of this provision speaks of an identical penalty for those who do not follow orders, make it impossible or difficult to perform business activities" shall the journal.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski said "Rzeczpospolita" that although he agrees with the main message of the proposal, he fears that if implemented, he can be used in political manifestations.
"In situations of freedom demonstrations, it would be unfavorable and instead of smoothing the situation, it would even tighten it up," he adds.
According to the statistics provided by the newspaper, 86% of citizens positively assessed police interventions in 2018 and that 1.5 million interventions in the city take place each month.
Buras is worried about Europe
Jáchym Topol has written in his blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
The father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important post-war Czech playwrights, today mentioned in one row with Václav Havel.
So from the beginning there was a curse of talent on Jáchym, which he was trying to exploit.
After eight years, he came back with Sensitive Man.
The heroes are Buras and Soňa along with two sons, who do not form a typical Czech family.
They're traveling actors, traveling around Europe.
He's a Shakespeare and a thief, she's a one-eyed translator who doesn't part with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys hadn't made a sound since he was born, and for the other, time stopped in infant times.
But it's not the heroes who are the most important in this story.
All of them are just backgrounds for observing a world where there is no room for artistic nomads anymore.
It's a world of flea-like provinces, society of old, suspicious people and promiscuous young people.
"Sensitive man" is sometimes turned into an absurd theater.
Narration mimics didaskalia, and hero talks create this world.
The scene is Europe full of fears about its future, but also constant questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancelled 105 flights due to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook
Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook has fallen, his Belgian subsidiary Neckermann is functioning.
The company, however, has problems.
According to VRT, Brussels Airlines announced that they would cancel 105 flights in October due to Thomas Cook's bankruptcy problems.
Neckermann also fired 75 employees.
All departures with the office that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but holidaymakers will be able to receive a refund.
The Ghent court also declared the bankruptcy of three Belgian daughters companies: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently, about 12 thousand Belgians are abroad on trips purchased at Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were supposed to leave the office by the end of the year.
On Monday, Thomas Cook Belgium Leen Segers spokesperson said that the company is now "fully operational" despite the bankruptcy of the British mother company, which caused concern among employees and customers.
At that time, the Bureau calmed down that the customers who bought the tours would go on vacation.
Thomas Cook - the oldest and one of the largest travel agencies in the world - declared bankruptcy at night from Sunday to Monday.
The direct cause of bankruptcy was the collapse of talks on Sundays of last chance with creditors and potential investors.
The creditors demanded that, in addition to the £900 million rescue plan agreed in August, the company obtain an additional £200 million as a security for the winter period, when travel agents usually have lower turnover.
However, the company's problems have increased for several years, resulting in a debt of £1.6 billion.

Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for your review
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion - such an extraordinary offer has been prepared for German visitors Görlitz.
Actions are designed to help combat the progressive decline in the number of inhabitants of the city.
Görlitz is the easternmost city of Germany.
A beautiful pastel town attracts 140 thousand tourists a year.
However, as "The Guardian" writes, the city is struggling with considerable problems.
Görlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.
The city also struggles with a constant loss of population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left for the west of the country, which resulted in a 25% decrease in the population of the city.
In 2013, it amounted to 54,000 people.
In order to fight the depopulation, officials came up with an idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
So far, 150 applications have been received.
Two thirds of them were made by the inhabitants of large cities.
Hungarian, Czech, United States and Great Britain were also interested in the programme.
"When we applied, we thought the program was supposed to convince people to move to Görlitz," said one of the project participants.
"Now we feel that it doesn't matter whether we stay here after four weeks or not," he added.
The city has seven thousand vacant apartments, and unemployment is three times the average across the country.
Although the city authorities hope that some will move permanently, the main objective of the programme is to obtain the opinion of the participants in the programme.
Information gathered from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.
"We want to know more about what people need, and if they decide to move - what their motivation was," said Robert Knippschild.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas to lure new residents, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a program to pay promising young professionals for their life and work in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy or in the American Tulsa, Oklahoma.
