Black box in your car?
While the U.S. street schemeers are struggling to reduce wealth to improve high-way systems, many are seeing the solution to the smallest black box, which fits the dashboard on your car's dashboard.
The device, which tracks every mile run by automobile and directs the information to the authorities, has become an issue of debate for America's major streets.
The boring task, like high school, has become a sudden debate and an issue of life-sanity.
You've joined the Libretannian groups to collect details of the location that has been driveed, and probably used this information to prepare a tax bill - perhaps to support the government to provide support for the use of these black boxs.
The tea party's fun.
American citizens are also very concerned about picking up a variety of privacy points.
While Congress couldn't agree whether to take further action, not much of the state waiting.
They're searching how they can go to a system in which a driver should pay every mile fixed on the road.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black box for test drive, some of which have G.P.S.
It's really essential for our country.
"It's not about whether or not to be selected by us," says Hazen Icara, the executive director of the South California government, who is planning to track every mile fixed by motorists in California by 2025.
We're going to have to change the way we paid.
It's technology to do this.
The main reason for this is that the country's high - ranking trust union has become virtually derived, which pays the taxes paid on gas pumps by American citizens.
American people don't buy more gas than ever before.
Now the car goes over more miles in a gallon gas.
There was no increase in the Federal Council for 20 years, which is 18.4 St.
Because of the high value of gas, politicians also avoid increasing a money in the tax tax.
"It's not very important," says the Transport policy specialist Leitby at the University of Massachusetts."
His state has recently planted a tracking device in 500 cars to test the per-mill pay system.
They say, "It will work as the most reasoning option in the past."
vonx calls it Myz-based user pay.
It's not surprising that this idea sounds good to the urban generousists, because it can be changed to change systems for driving cars as an example, which can help lower the temperature and reduce greenhouse gases.
Chasy's plans for this system are eager, whereas they are developing strategy to meet the goal set out in the superpower global global laws of the state.
But the president of the Home Transport Committee, Rs. Bill Hester (a.P.P.) also consider the most long option to the Black Box.
The free dealer in the Stateization is also in favor of payment every mile by the driver.
"It's not just something that is going to be in the blind well, " said Adrian Moore, the vice president of policy."
People are paying more clearly for what they're receiving.
The campaign has also supported two former American transportaries who had favored its report from Congress to Congress on the direction of per-mill payments in 2011.
The U.S. Sensor accepted a trial project for 90-partian dollars last year, including 10,000 cars.
But working on the concerns of rural method-operation, which were representative of people who had to walk too many miles to cry for work or to go to town, the lead of America ended up at the offer.
Yet many kingdoms and cities themselves are moving in this direction.
It has the most willing Oregen, who listed 5,000 drivers in the biggest use in the country.
These drivers are going to pay conjuncture fees instead of gasing the Kingdom.
Nevada has already completed the initial test.
New York City is also moving in this direction.
Illino is trying with truckers on the limited basis.
And the I-95 Association, including 17 state transport departments with East Seaboards (myland, Pengena, Virginia, and Florida), is studying how they can survive this change.
This idea did not get supported in all places.
The drivers were very impatient to think that the government could monitor every step they took.
"Bigra Bonham and other types of information were a major problem," says Aluvin Khan, who directed the strategy and the operational administration in the Dominican Transport Department.
This isn't something people wanted.
At the same time, Nevada's A.L.U.A. warned on her website: "It would be quite easier to convert these device into full tracking device."
It's not great, it's no need to develop an unprejudicial technology structure, which everyone must have to be able to keep a record of crying and going.
Nevada is one of the many states that she's doing all she can to achieve potential technology, with which the Kingdom can find out how many miles a day the car is going, but not where and where it's going.
Khan said that if you can do this, people can feel more comfortable.
This technology sought to bring some state agencies closer to the small Calypania Start-up, named Truz.
This firm wasn't basically in business helping the state taxists.
It was attempting to enter an auto insurance market, which had to pay the drivers on the basis of their payies.
But the device that this is testing has made Highway schemes look good, because it doesn't have the use of GPS and provides too limited information, which is uploaded by modems at the fixed speed.
The chief minister of Truzz said, "If you don't track people's speed and their place, they'll be more willing to adopt this way."
There have been some serious mistakes in these early programs of the state.
There are also very low expenses and less intervention methods to do this.
In Oregan, planning drivers are using various options.
They can choose the device on GPS or without GPS.
Or don't choose any device again, but you can choose to pay dues to the average mile set by the inhabitants of the state.
Other places hope that the device can be sold to anxious citizens by providing more assistance than in the device.
In New York City, the transportation authorities are trying to develop a taxing device that allows you to pay the tax fees, which will provide "pay insurance" according to your drive, and make up real speed data from other drivers using motor - drive traffic to avoid motor - drive traffic.
The city's document mentioned, "moster-conceiters will be attracted to sharing in it because of the benefits it received."
Some transportation schemes wonder, though, that all the discussion on payment for miles is a big distraction.
The Action Transport Commission in San Francisco Bay has said that the Divalia High Court can easily deal with the problem of High Trust Fashion by increase in Congress gas tax.
The extra time or annual fees on Highway or other cars can also be paid, whose vehicles don't use too much gas so that they can pay their proper part.
Redy Retler, director of the Commission's Department and public affairs, said, "What does the operation of an operation require for the patient?"
If we do that, millions of car drivers will be concerned about their privacy and many other things.

In a letter presented by Mr. S. S. S.
Speaking truth, though, isn't a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snow Denton said that he believed that he could rule the American government to expose criminal charges against the international community.
A file of American justice department includes a hearing-up charge that includes stealing from the government property.
laugher Peter Frederick, minister of German internal affairs, told Zeit online: "Mr.M.Mr. San de German authorities are ready to talk to us, so we will find ways to make it possible."

Frotier Air Force director - on-on-Gurgeez
Frontier is planning to pay $1100 for passengers on his plane board.
Frotier is planning to start a charge for $100 in the air-on bag and pay $12 for coffee or soda, although the passengers can keep the entire box, although on Wednesday announce that the passengers can keep the entire box.
The new delivery - on - page fee is for the bag overhede in the bag, so, under the seat, the smaller bag will be returned.
Frontier said he'd charge $25 if paid in Adres, will wait $100 if passengers wait to pay while they're at the gate.
Fronter's spokesman Ket O'amley said that $100% of passengers have to get to care for the charge in Advenis.
"We don't want to charge him," he said.
Airnis started charge for the first and second test bag in 2008.
The passengers who are trying to avoid the fees are the ones who can do as much as they can in the delivery-on bag that is placed in the overheed box, that means that this box is often lower in the box.
Pay boarders have a way to reduce passengers.
O'Maley said it's not really about buying the new charge money.
It's for the most loyal clients about Frontier that finding out that overheed's hard to find place.
Airline doesn't have to give this to passengers who buy tickets in their website.
That means that the next person in line might give up 100 dollars for a similar bag, whereas a traveler on a front-line, on a front-line, can get a bag free.
O'Malesley said that the website and check operations of Frotier are being changed and that they know about fees before they get to the gate.
The new delivery fee for Frotier will not start up to summer though a date has not been set.
Travelers often reveal discontent about the bag owners and the other fees, but the plane service likes them.
They argue that the bagage spends money to handle, and those who want Travelers should pay for it.
The fees at Wall Street are watching as a sign that many airline loss have been paying enough money to cover the cost of air travel after the years.
Although most pay-- on-on-the-hand bag isn't touched.
Spirt Aarlines Inc. The delivery - on -on fee began three years ago, and the partner Douger Sagner later.
With such a fee there's another Airline Huguegrie's Winger, who said Airline counselor J. Soensen, and who tracks e - on - on fees.
He said the delivery fee in São Paulo brings $50 million to a year that was estimated in the December 2011 report.
A former official of the Soensen, Brussels Aircraft, recently flew off and passengers are faced with a retard - on - on - an unusual bag fee at the gate.
"Toboarding process that I saw in my Airline career," he said.
I expected to bite my teeth and look out at a battle gate.
"was full and he said it was litri-sit-up."
Frontier is also following $2 fee for coffee, tea, Soda, or jus.
Frontier said that visitors who take Soda, or jusa, can keep the entire box, and it will give only once.
It will give away the water still.
Trying to charge for the drink in US Air strike times in 2008, but after the complaint of passengers, they turned back seven months later and followed up after any other chief airline.
Travelers of Froter's's--if they don't buy from Airline directly, this step of Frontier is his fresh attempt to conduct customers to his own website.
Airick payments online Trubitz for $10 to every sold ticket.
That's why all Air Parkers have been encouraged to operate passengers to buy them straight out of an online polling agency.
Although Frontier, this area has gone forward.
In September often a number of flying miles began to give half to customers who bought from an online polling agency
On Wednesday it subtracted Mykoz Afflicted for 25 percent of the trip mile.
So, a 1,000 miles of Frontier buys from an online contravenal agency will earn 250 miles [250 km] away.
It also allows them to choose their seat in advance for the only passengers when they buy from the Frotier website.
Frontier has a loyal base of customers in his home city in Denver, but his business is going to decrease and it's losing money.
The 9 percent drop in revenue, and its flight is reduced by about 13 percent in the first quarter, at the highest rate in the Republic's Air Force Holding Air St.
The Republic are trying to arrange the financial funds of Frober as part of the airline sales.
NSA accuses the website to crash instead of "normal error"
The secret national security agency on Friday told some technically that our website was closed for hours, not because of what some claimed to be online.
The secret agency said in advance: "Today NSA was not in access to NSA.gov for hours, due to an internal error during pre-pestation."
This evening this problem will be solved.
It's not true that this barrier came due to the attack because of the distribution of service [DD.O.S.].
On evening the online server trackers found that the NSA website was closed for at least six hours, and some users still have no site.
The spokesman for the NSA said to ABCS that the agency's inner, sensitive network had not even "behaved. "
Astronomer said, nobody is in danger.
At least one primeist group has claimed that they are responsible for tD.S. attacks by N.A.
The DD.O.S. attacks are designed in such a way that the target website is sent to traffic so large that the site will not be closed because the server overloads over.
It's relatively partial strategy and the purpose of attacks is not to distinguish the internal network of systems.
Formerly mysterious n.A.A., ever named "no such agency," has become a subject of discussion and bitterness among the people over the past months by coming to the presence of foreign and domestic spy programs, which have been widely separated by former former UN. orgD.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.
Because of such increasing controversy about the agency, there was such an opinion after tonight's incident that it was the result of the action of the targeting operation.
A beautiful expression was presented in harmony with the era and current conditions of Thevavas and today.
It was shown in the chains of today's fallout and forced a teacher to walk on the wrong road.

Falling in the profits of Bmbarbarbarier as a plane delivery
The Canada's Airplane and the train at Bombar St. Bombarer, on Thursday, reported the drop of 15 percent of the increase in pure benefit, at the third quarter in its movement and at the increase in the contracts by the aircraft and under pressure by the delivery.
The Normbarer, based in Montreal, didn't even present an update on any flight test data for his brand new CSerries plane or your ambitious program of going into commercial service at the first September.
Nearly half a month before the trial plane takes its first flight, it's just done three times, the question arises on the track whether the test step is on.
The result is less than forecasting and sent more than 8 percent to the stock market business.
With Cameron Docsen, the National Bank's nearly minor share on Thursday had subtracted his rating to "From" field display 'for the next one or two quarters is above.
"Suppose aircraft delivery was most expected, we're clearly disappointed with the customs displayed in transport, " Brotherssen said in a client note.
We'll receive new orders for Bmbarer Cersies as an advance of flying program.
If any new orders are not announced in months coming, however, the market program will be slugged.
Bumbarder hopes the plane family can cut it off now and end it at the lower end of the Air Cricket market.
The first test plane occurred in March and was launched for the first time in September after a delay.
Possible Cretans are the ones that wait for testing of the company's claims about the new jetliner fuel and possible cost savings but are the ones that are the ones that are the firm order for CSersies to determine 177.
15 customers and operators are available 403 full laws and agreements.
The main executive officer Pierre Buddener had faith in Bombarier will fulfill his 300 firm strategy from bringing the jet commercial use.
Officials and Thursdays convinced the media that the program was running according to schedule.
"The surveillance plane was living on land for a long time than forecasting," Bondoin said in an international call, it was also set up during the testing and software update schedule.
Every creator makes a different schedule.
We had decided to take a first flight and to schedule an update and that's what we've done.

George Kervin: Euron gave the choice to Scotts
Another Day, Another Story of Fear of Freedom
This time we're warned that freedom Scotland will need to join the independent journey zone throughout Europe as state of e.U.
The passport controls and points out stories about the limit on the walls of Bangon.
The truth is that the paper described the possible economic benefits of independence with the rest of Europe, although the forecast has not been described in the headlines.
Nor did anyone describe that most of their time spent trying to change their formal rules according to their own needs.
Since Scotland is no longer the Skiga area, so Brasworth would be always easy to get whatever he wants from Scotland, instead of receiving anything from Scotland.
So, then, A-Sharnie.
And the thing trapped so long has grown, and first I meant "freeness" passport control was heard nearly 40 years ago.
Yet the interesting point was lost in again telling this fascinating old story.
Why should free Scotland expect Europe to pass through?
Why trading for Brandon, in London, especially now?
The real European news here is: The great, war-war-making plan to organize Europe has finally stopped.
With the Euro-Cal crisis, the project has officially been dead in Europe.
There are devoted teams strong to resist EU in all EU or to stop Euro as a currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosarian for the German Party - which has been established this year - suddenly received nearly five million votes in the federal election of September, thus effectively out of the Free Democrats (the equivalent of our Librems).
The planning to build federal Europe has always been domestic resistance.
However, the current economic crisis proved to be a natural changer.
In addition to the harsh rules imposed by the Berlin and European central bank, many are having to think that the project has gone far.
The vast budget of national governments did not have a huge role in the crisis of Euronique - it was only true in Greece's case.
Rather, the Euromon system has fixed its members in favor of German exporters to the exchange rate - something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of a domestic currency waste, South Europe finds itself in a state of disastrous damage to productiveness compared to Germany.
The only solution is to reduce pay and public living - encouraged by Berlin.
Dark European producers far ahead of problems.
To allow French and German energy firms on the computer of users to free - as a result of the "each" energy policies imposed by Braby, the European industry pays four times twice as much for electricity and gas as the United Nations does.
It's the cost of Pinginging, which we've already seen in Legmouth.
Even in the world, not all wages have been adopted by the European Remillicles industry can prevent the cost of online U.S. shell gas.
As a result, there is a spirit of rebellion, especially in France, who was once the principal fan of EU.
After U.S. war, France's top politicians had seen e.U. control of Germany, and Paris was looking for a solution to provide Billingings equal to Waldton in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs a passport for political validity, and it has applied its own financial policy on Europe, which causes France's economy to deteriorate.
The result: Mary Lenne's south square, E.U.A. National Front has recently won a victory at the third site.
The Front 24 percent is the most popular group in France at this time - this is a warning to British Lebber that they can't believe that it will always profit for the left, he will always do it for the right.
What is Le Pen's doing with his new reputation between French lovers, working class?
This party uses e.U.A. choices that happen in the next year to be the E.U.A. to create an anti-constitutor group in the European Parliament.
If, as far as it is possible, the anti-opposing parties do well in these elections, this kind of party can first affect the European Parliament.
I think this is my view: Soon there will be an anti-ist and the most loyal position in Europe to eliminate Euro-ductures mixed with anti-closing emotion.
Euro won't be complete, but it'll be as if it'll be back in Europe (the Lord's) nations 'or in some way that will support General Dippel.
Germany and some of its economy can maintain Euronel, but France and southern Europe will re-enter their currency.
I hope the UK will keep himself away from this project, hoping to raise these projects with U.S.
However, the growing interest in Watishton in please indicates that Britain will be left in the cool Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after all?
We can choose to be a region of little England (requiredly) small.
Or we can protect our own financial interests - including telling Berlin and 1952 to separate at the right time.
I think Scotland can do better work in the private European system, if we keep our own currency.
It would be easier to work with other people in Europe of non-sected nations in Europe.
Otherwise we should consider maintaining our financial freedom by following the way of Norwe.
In Scotland S.N.P. Government - generally referred to as the most successful military campaign in Europe, which won much publicity by Leber's Chasler undresser.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for freedom at this time, because in that case, it would have to accept law of reproducing in Berlin and 1952.
Wynn: Getting Big Out of Time · Global Voices
Research indicates that African-American and Hispnic girls get too young at younger ages than their age.
Physical change does not mean that the kitchen is near
There are no witnesses that Hormon or any other chemical can be blamed
Experts believe that obesity can be a cause of obesity at a low age
Javin's case before time isn't that effective in boys
A former reporter from C.N.P. journalists in the health and family issues of the former president of Pat Ethern's Children.
Should the mother be concerned, if in her daughter's 7 or 8 years of age, breast - feeding and childbirth begin at birth?
This week in Orlando, Florida, at the annual meeting of the American Medical School of Medicine, U.S.A., in the United States, Dr.
Caploz says, "I spend a lot of time to convince the parents that it doesn't usually reflect rapid progress in the direction of full moon."
The obvious symptoms of growth, such as the sprouting of breast cancers, the hairy hair and the body smells from time to time.
In the last four decades, however, the age of R.I (first month) has been quite simple.
In the United States, average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in 1970.
"When the breast starts to develop, the authors are at least two to three years in the first hundred years in the vision," says Caplojz, who "time and time in the womb: The guides are also necessary to deal with this common problem.
The most precise test time for IV's development.
Wynn's beginning is disputed, but when breast development grows with breast development before 8 years of age, two call it "ball."
In most cases this procedure will slow down or stop - which child doctors can take a closer look.
In the process of more rapid progress, there may be a need to check through the fluctuations so that the chances of such serious problems as tumors or aist can be resolved.
The treatment is to delay the period-time monthly and other consequences: increase the age-old age-time of the bone, which can cause an increased growth and height of adults.
Careys for drug or Hermon treatment, child life, development rate, growth rate, and emotional adults depend on treatment.
Psychologists are also important.
We're on the underlying side of the problem, and we're going to find out what's going on.
Another major problem can be considered: Parent doesn't just want his daughter to have menstruation.
" They worry about the risk of conception, or how they're going to keep clean."
A woman whose daughter was diagnosed with menstruation when she was 10 years old recalls, "It was a shock."
Although this had symptoms and we had talked about menstruation, it wasn't emotionally ready.
She was scared of her school and was upset that she was the first month in her friends.
There are many well-known principles about the causes of current activity.
Yet, there is no constant testimony that in milk or other food products, Hoermon, or the sexually transmitted messages in the environment, there is no constant charge that the messages in the milk or the environment can be accused of sexually transmitted messages.
Sons - like girls - are receiving time-old.
Caplovics determine the law that its main cause is the wrath of obesity.
He helped to conduct studies over 6 to 9 years of age in the year, adding the fat of the body to the discharge time.
Other results support the conclusion, but there are also many other factors that contribute to it.
In this country, African-American and Hispnic girls have the tendency to have sex before their age girls.
There's a lot of explanation of this.
On global levels, the representation of time-old, from economic conditions to climate and genetics, seems to be affected by all things.
Other puzzles: Although boys are getting face and hairy hair at an early age, women are not as clear as girls are of all ages.
Other physicians attending the AAP conference upheld the complexity of the subject.
Even in babies and children, it has become common to be protected and seen with the hair of tellby.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the real beginning of the paradise," says Dr. Lawrence Silverman in Morristown, New York.
Parents should not hesitate to take guidance from their child doctor to find out how to talk to their children.
Caplojz advised, "The meaning could be to talk before expected time."
If you're quiet, your child will usually answer correctly.
Girls already having a history need to be assured that even if it's been long before it's happening, it's part of normal life.

In an argument with the seat width at the large order of jets.
A contesting for a dispute for Dubai Awards of this month has appeared between the width of the tourist flight seats for long flights
The debate centered on the seat of the long flying aircraft in the Ekmememeysi class, which is not always given by Erlines but has claimed to be a key.
Erbu lays a wide seat in this week's macaws, at least 18 inches (16 cm) in the Ekomymebin, but it should be determined by the Erlines by his principal - conductor Bos.
The debate occurs between 17-21 and western Americans when the order was registered after the incident of the 17th - 21th century B.C.E. was a competition to sell the large project of Erinsky's twin engine.
How has the last plane department been built - especially if Cing 9 or 10 is equal to the claims of more capacity - the design of Mini zto jets in view?
Bonne says that it is "777 X," which will replace 406 people in 17 inches [17 cm] wide and 10 in a row.
Airplane says A350 competed with A350 will take 350 people to the seat left in 18 inches.
The aircraft is often used by advertising in the business press to strike business matters on technical matters.
Now, air just with 777 X is expected to overtake more than 100 orders in Dubai, which is extending to the public.
It's been recently observed that the Vigefff War has begun with these Jainero show together with three at the same time in Regina. Would you accept it?
Air connection sales chief John Lehe said, "There's a long distance flying from the country's Throbos in Bangladesh."
As change, people's getting nice, but the plane hasn't changed the way it was.
According to data from the U.S. Department of Health, between the 1970 ' s and 1970 ' s when Branch 747 Zobo defined no modern long journey, and the average age of the century hit me 10 percent.
According to American Health Statistics, the relationship between American men in the 21st century is 397 inches, according to the 21st century.
Airbu says that his rival of 1950 is tied to a seat concept when the average difference between the new name set and the "jet" was a circled circle.
AirBus says they have established research techniques that suggest improvement in the quality of 50% of sleep in the width of the seat.
Bran had disputed the statistics of the air bus's seat measure, and he said it doesn't depend on the decision of a doctor to rent and provide.
Also, research shows that over the width of a seat depends on the experience of addition.
" It's actually in providing airlines in and on things that have faith in what they need to do in order to succeed."
"They don't want to tell us what they benefit from."
They know better their business than someone else.
For Flureys it's about the tattoo room, but for the accordings it's a fast point that it can affect income.
In at least 700 billion dollars a year behind the dispute is the commercial business of the plane order to weigh the American and European export scales, enough.
For the first time in July of reporting the surveyer, the seat layout of what is actually the battle point between new jets.
AirBus and Bongae claim that the seat is 20 percent per cent of their new twin-in-law design, compared to the leader of that section, with 365-300 B.C.E.
The claims to be displayed depends on the claim of a loan to 1077 x B.C.E. to compare the original 777 design with the original 777 design of the forest.
10 equals now compared with profit at unit cost.
Kevin Canton, U.S. Airplane of Europe, says, "It's going to capture their products, with their products and more constituent seats."
On the other hand, misunderstandings say that the entire 10-to-coat-line combination is suggested for 777 B.C.E. that several passengers are on the side of the Detoner layout, who can go with cheap rent as well.
Kobin's ex-commodor expert Merob, the founder, and the editor's flight girl network said "can be very nice for passengers at the seat width of 18 inches [18 cm], but the fact is that this business point of AirBus is conducted by the threat of 777."
Air just and passing seats do not supply but provide a list to select from the cameras.
Even the jet dealer around the world will take careful measures to check this layoutship.
In much rest, all builders are providing high density layouts for jet services and international travel.
AirBus is paying a 10 equal A350 but says it's not sold right now.
But until recently, airBus insisted on some of its jets on the global panel seats in order to provide more material.
Modern jets don't expect a new industry to fly on stairbergs without support of another manufacturer, but it can distract it from the wave of 777 X sales.
The new anti-virusion vaccine can end the joy of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-virusion vaccine, which can end the fun of smoking.
The same dose of vaccines was able to protect the rats from the addiction of the nacotine for all life.
Before a test is started on man, there is a need for a test that may take many years, but in New York professor of Velell Medical College said there are surprises.
Professor Cornel said that "we hope this kind of vaccine can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to quit smoking using all the methods available in the market today, but they found that their addiction is far more powerful than these current methods."
The new vaccine has a fatal virus, prepared to provide genetic information for the cause of anti-contributional anti-virus.
It infected the virus, selectedly organized cell, which begins to form a permanent stream of anti-ceptions after that.
The antibidge is looking for any chemical molecules in the blood, preventing the discovery of nicotine within the smoker by trying to get them into the brain before they reach it.
In the trial, the vaccines who were later embezzled kept doing their normal activities.
But the researchers say that the rat that wasn't given a vaccine "was good," it was a sign that nicotine had reached his brain.
This use was described in the journal Science Development.
The former tobacco vaccines had failed because they had anti-virus.
It contained regular doses to keep an anti-obidz level, but it proved expensive and unsanitary.
But the cost of a new vaccine is expected to be too much, since the righteous cell will make it an anti-bondi's factory.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before today's greed for tobacco can be saved.
But it's probably used to quit smoking by people who smoke.
He said, "They will find out that if they start smoking again, they will have no pleasure in smoking because of a vaccine that can help them break their habit.
British scientists reported the result to be interesting, but warned of the need to be very much research.

After the evidence given on Thursdays by Linfhabe, former chief of the staff, this charge was known as Mr.D. Obide Mr. Obide, are you testing now?
During the years of the discussion in 2005, the government pressured the public bar to begin the board.

In 2009 the text for the board lines, which released Obide's annual $5 million dollars, was converted to the Tennders without boarders.

457 slaves on theja can pass through the trial "promisity"
The government is considering a "profeitation" trial for foreign workers on 457 vja, because its purpose is to expand a severe action.
If it is adopted, this test will be applied through a course designed to prevent 457 used to raise or reach families and friends in Australia.
Today a government discussion was issued, saying that the former Leber Lef. Max McPynq could provoke neighboring countries in Australia, condemning government terms of foreign employees.
He said to the U.S. Indian Institute today that "foreigners are reaching the end of a queue" and that what "Surrelishers are already looking for is very unpleasant at a time when the Union demands a safe labor market."
Apparently, this meant that the white workers should have been provided protection - and I wouldn't be surprised if some in the area saw the historical testimony there.
The discussion is shown in the letter 12 steps, previously considered by the former local minister Chris Boven.
The local minister Brendton O'Conhan, who was in Sri Lanka tomorrow where he met the authorities about the people who traded, have destroyed five outstanding changes, while the remaining thoughts are under.

The British government has announced a study to increase the benefits of Scotland from the HS2 railway project.
Work by HS2 points to high speed services in the north of Scotland and England, which will soon begin with the first phase in 2026.
The Transport minister Barry told Cream that this project would be one of the "Britain"
The Transport minister of Scotland said they are very "constitutable" by working with the British government on this project.
The first phase will include a new high speed train between London and West Middleas.
When the second phase is complete, the lines will reach me and guide me.
In June, the government transferred the cost of high speed link between London and northern England to 232 B.7 B.C.E. and fixed $422.6.6.6.6.
The British government, who was conversing with Scotland transport, directed HS2 lemmededed to consider the potential and potential of the journey to North England and Scotland.
It includes the possibility of losing or reducing the potential travel time from Glassgo and Edinburgh to London for about three hours or less.
Hates: "Our goal forHS2 is the real national network, which will draw the UK and its cities."
We're moving with HS2, because its benefits will be much more.
Without it we'll face problems related to our railway network's ability.
But this is also about the connect of 18 cities in Britain, including Glassgo and Edinburgh, which will be more closely linked to HS2.
Scottish Secretary Everettler, according to: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed the "Send" return from Mr. Kamel in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown explained: "The high speed train is the possibility of a high - speed economic advantage to Scotland, but it also increases the financial burden on Scotland in the high - speed train throughout Britain.
So we're excited to work in the partnership of the British government to bring high speed trains into Scotland, to create benefits for all and to investigate the options to fulfill the Glass-Expend Line, which Scott's government is planning already.
I'm willing to review the investigation report with the British State counselors next year and make a decision together on the further action.
Plans will continue to prevail in Australia
In US the soft movement in tools has to continue launching its tablobs and smart phones while flying off the Australian Airplanes, and when the plane moves down.
The US federal aircraft administration has opened the option to change American air-booters' processes, so that passengers will be able to read e-book, watch video or play games during the important flight phase, if they are able to play the game on their equipment "boon" mode.
Travelers can still do this during many flights, but it's not good to be able to reach your e-book method when flying and flying.
The Australian Winds Service Committee is considering the decision, which will make the USans work too much work to meet the need, but he has indicated that they have no immediate plan to change their processes.
The government Planan Security Authority also said that he was thinking about the announcement, but cored that the use of power equipment still in Australia is effective in the important stages of flying.
"The current time near CASA, the plane has no specific instructions to control the flow of power devices," said the authorization, "the underlying functions are to ensure that the security system is always built, and the passengers follow instructions to protect the maintenance of the crew members."
Horinator who's already talking with CASA about expanding the use of his In-FFitite entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but he asked to take action on the application of the alphabet.
The spokesman said that "we'll welcome a review by CASA about the permission to use electrical devices, because we really think it will give customers better experience, because now we have in our plane.
Quantas said he would follow the current rules right now.
It said, "We can't be used to fly according to our current policy and use electric devices during the plane landing, and we have no immediate plan to change it."
FAA decide applies to the U.S. Elberlines.
Well, we're always interested in advance developments that can benefit travelers, and we'll surely consider FA's decision and reasons behind them.
The effect of this decision, every US air transporter, will differ on the company and depend on the lives of their aircraft.
Airplanes will need to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio activity from mobile devices, as well as to give short details about their rules, training materials, safe-hand bags, and passengers.
FAA said that after their aircraft's ability to carry their passengers, he would allow the passengers to have control over all the heights, such as the light weight tool, the e-mailer and the smart phone."
In rare cases of loss, the crew will direct the crew to close their equipment during the plane's landing.
The group has also suggested keeping heavy equipment safely under the seat or in the upper container during the flight and landing.
The silver of Ponbrobros because of the middle class feeling hardship in Singapore
In Singapore people in the Benemire shopping mall in Pesangarr are taking cash to pay their daughter's school fees, purses, and so on.
Mrs. Freethling said, "My husband and I bought a house recently, so all our money is involved in it."
She says, though, they earn 3,000 $400, U.S.S.), and their husbands too work, but family income is insufficient.
In fact, this is the kind of demand in the parts of South Asia where domestic debt is increasing - Wells where they are taking their own business became the third poison on Singapore's Xinz this week.
The only way to obtain the cash is to keep the jewelry hostage - M. S. R., in case of wealthy S. S.
It usually takes 17% of interest in Singapore, which is only 15.4 percent more than the 15.4 percent of those who are distributed by the United States, which is the local lender who has branch in the shopping office.
However, Postenbros have the advantage of not being able to check the credit or pay evidence, and they can pay more quickly than the bank.
Because of the increased cost of living by families and the growing increase of domestic and user loans, millions in this area are facing the problem.
After the global financial disaster, strong growth for five years, and poor credit in developed businesses because of poor credit, low income and middle - income families are turning to the problem to fill their needs.
This week the rating agency, Standards, blamed the growing domestic advantage of increased hostages because of increased mortgages.
It said that in Asia the highest domestic debt in Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore is the highest in the proportion of domestic product.
Malaysian G.D. is on the highest level in this list, while it was 60 percent in 2008.
There are concern about the high standards of consumer debt in Thailand, which has been lightened by this week's technology delay.
On Thursday, data has shown continued export times and lack of demand.
In the Malaysian Bank, C.M.A., gesang Zongu Vun said, "The key point is that with increasing prices, people who come into the lower classes will attempt to increase their income in every possible way."
A historically high values in the values of gold in the past two years have moved people to keep personal possessions in pledge, because they are taking advantage of the opportunities to buy the jewelry of their family.
In Singapore there are 70 percent gold stored in a city-in-tralet of the city's 200 packet.
They're saying, "Cash's feeling good, let's keep grandma's gold chain hostage, and we'll take it back next month.
The biggest Postenent director in Thailand, Ejiman, has seen 20 percent of the increase in the number of customers using their outlet in recent months.
There is so much increase in the business of keeping a hostage that out there are 15 others like it in Bendmir and Singapore planning not only to expand in their neighborhood, in Malaysia, where its four shops are, but also outside Asia.
The company will support him, and Singapore will use 60 percent of Singapore's $5 per cent of the dollars being spent in this week listing.
While some disks have been criticized for high interest rates, Ms Johns says that keeping a pledge is not only a cheap rate but also an obvious increase in debt.
They say, "The clients keep things they already have, and they don't add to the stock market.
The social acceptance of Pebrobrocing to receive temporary and safe financial assistance is increasing.
It's not that Postenbros only use the vulnerable person in financial terms.
Even rich people in Singapore use the Wall Streetlet, keeping Gold Times or Rances hostages, so they can buy 60 percent of cash for their purchase.
We come customers of all classes of society.
Ms. John says, "These rich persons include those who need a debt for commercial activities or investments, or small business that need to meet their cash requirements."
Sometimes they need money just in a short time.

The commission of three members will be set up to ensure that it is as effective and effective as possible by the Kingdom.
Mr. Wilkey said that 325 million dollars would not mean much more than that until, "the public health system of Tasmania's population is more likely to improve in an even greater degree."
Yet, they praised the government for their request immediately to respond to their request, which they brought to the prime minister at the beginning of May."
Mr. Wilkey said, "I hope the Leagueal Help package will be very helpful in the direction of separating the state state state state state health system from the crisis list."
According to the state government, these additional alternative processes are mainly going to reverse the recently cutoffs.
But the League's Federal Health assistant Peter Ricten believes that today's announcement is "Band-AD solution."
He said to the A.B.C. T.V., "We're here because we're here because theber State government took 430 million dollars in his health system.
You can't accept as good news days to be taken by the state government for about half a billion dollars and given 300 million dollars by the nation.
Mr. Presidentton demanded that Mr. Compreque handysec be given one out of the defense package wouldn't have been sold to a single-furbordinate.

FAA: The airships can now use the compass (but can't call the cell phone)
Airship will be able to use their electronic devices to get through the entrance through the gate, to do things, play games, watch the movies, listen to music -- but not to speak to your cell phone -- it's under extremely advanced new direction through the federal administration.
But passengers shouldn't expect these changes immediately.
At a news conference, Mr.P.P., the administrator of the U.A. said how fast these changes are done, it would be different in every airline.
Airlines will show FAA how their aircraft completes new direction systems, and how the rules of crew members are updated for training books and devices.
The FAA says that it has already found plans to expand some airline devices to use portable devices on the plane.
Delta and jet points are one of the airlines that have already presented plans.
Says FAA in one statement: "On the basis of the situation, we can accept extensive use of electronic devices very quickly.
In addition, passengers need to close their keyboard, tabloct, and other devices when the plane's door is shut.
They're expected to reach 10,000 feet of the plane and not start until the captain's permission is granted.
The passengers are expected to resum their devices at the landing of the plane, and don't launch them until the plane is completely down.
FA.A. said, under the new direction, the Airlines under the aircraft are well-protected, can allow their passengers to fly by plane, get off the plane, and use the time the taxi device.
Most of the new airline companies and other aircraft that have been modified to use Yff in high altitudes are expected to meet these levels.
The association of the project of the project of the project has welcomed these changes, president of the Profical Flight Avertor.
The Glades said in a statement: "When policy is performed in a secure manner, and we'll work with airline companies to do so - it'll be a victory thing for both sides."
When this point comes, we've had a sense of humor like "Hal monitors."
The agency said, but the agency will still be restricted to connecting the Internet at less than 10,000 feet per hour, using email exchange, send or receive messages, or download data.
The passengers will be asked to keep their smart flat, Tablote and other devices in the Airplay mode.
So there can't be any discussion with friends, online Scowle-like game related to that when anter Eldwin, on a flat board in 2011, was off the plane while a plane was at the airport, and when the device was prohibited by the American line was stopped by the American line.
And there's still to be a need to collect a flater-tucking tool, which would worry about hurting another person in addition to his granging.
The cell phone will continue to be blocked during flight.
The authority authority with the phone calls has the federal communication commission, F.A.
FAA can remove the ban on some electronic devices during the flight and landing.
Mark Rosen in National Transport Security System last month, a National Transport Security Special at CBS, said that cell phone is still at risk.
"Cell phone is really serious, not just because they can possibly generate a block to the navigational device, but also because they can create a call Towers when in air."
To check out this point, the International Association of International Associations has recommended that the government should allow more than any private electronic device.
These uses are increasing pressure in recent years to reduce restrictions.
Senn. Cychickakak, like D-mo, has said that there is no valid security reason for the ban.
These restrictions are becoming more difficult because the device is the most important thing to use.
Some studies suggest that nearly one third of passengers forget or ignore the instructions to close their device.
FAAA began to ban the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996 when reports were received from passengers in FM.S. radio and communication devices.
The new Airlines are more dependent on the electric system than on the previous generation of aircraft, but they have also been designed and accepted to resist electronic intervention by FA.
Airlines have been proposed by passengers for years using Y-F.
The powered aircraft are also more resistance to radiation.
Hutherta said that most airline companies should be guided to vessels for more use in the new direction device than in the electronic device.
Today's electronic device, too few radio transmissions from radio than in the previous generation's electronic device.
For example, when Iyder, back reserving page, there's just just a few names to be translated.
But the transmissions rise when download or send data by the device.
There's also Amazon, of those who take sides with the passengers using the device.com.
In 2011 the U.S. Offices of the Company loaded their full In Airlines and put it on trial for problems, but no such problem was found.
The FAA-A. counsel committee has expressed the mixed-jumicious sentiments about the risk of the device used by the device.
The National Airplane Association's Association said that they believe that the device is real, even if it's the risk of extinction.
Other members of the committee said that there are only pilot described in support of the removal of device in the Airsoft System, most of which are very old.
However, members of the committee insisted that FAA pilot be permitted to stop passengers when the plane was dropped in less-in-eparation.
The travel industry group has welcomed changes and said that they have common knowledge of people traveling during the latest phase of technology.
The U.S. Prostitution Association has told us that we are happy to know that there are passengers who are traveling with joy, travelers with defense and security.

Is Europe's high class willing to work with Britain?
In April the business campaign was launched and Britain was promised to bring business together and determine what changes we want to see with UK workers and skilled manufacturer EU.
For him we held the biggest and most extensive surveys of Britain's commercial leadership leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain's business with E.U.
UGavav designed for the idea of 1,000 businesses leading agents, representing Britain's commercial size, fields, and places.
This survey's conclusions can be amazing to many people.
We found that a large part of business workers now want to export out of Europe, and focus on those countries that are becoming modern and increase, while E.U.A.
They want the government to give priority to new business relationships with countries like China, India, India, and Brazil, not to get involved in the process of reforming the mysterious organizations of E.U.
When they asked their opinion about specific policies such as products law, most traders believed that the control of these decisive qualifications should return to the Westmester.
The common amusement could be seen very easily from a single market, business workers say that the value of the landion of Brazil is much higher than the benefits of having become part of Europe's business area - even the vast businesses that favor European companies that were traditionally favoring European companies were 40 percent.
And most clearly, our survey of professional leadershipists found that, one large part obviously wants to go beyond politics's business-based approach rather than the way of making peace.
The conclusion, which was seen in the standards of the major business groups, showed that businesses are moved to a "valueless change," to give the UK his lost strength back.
It's a huge price - the issue of making peace changes for Britain and getting a better deal changed 16 percent in the opinion of the E.U. to stay at home.
The prime minister should not be in doubt: It is a survey that the British business workers advocate their plan to talk at the terms of Britain's membership in E.U.
It also showed that businesses, current powerness, expect to re-enter into a meaningful change in behalf of UK.
A better deal for British businesses is possible, and very fast it's going to be, because there's going to be moving forward in the direction of Eurojin, the economy, and the statedic union.
First priority must be jobs and increase in Britain, as the conclusion of our survey indicates, it means a new focus on business and a basic change in focus in theization of the land.

Scientists have further shed light on the connection between the dog's tail and his mood.
The last research shows that the happy dogs move their tail towards the right (from the left), while the anxious dogs move their tail mainly to the left.
But now scientists say that a dog can recognize this little difference and respond to it.
This study has been published in the Journal Of course.
The University of the University of St. Louis, a medical professor from trainto Georgia, explained: "All of humans know that the left and right part of the brain includes different forms of the excitement that produces positive or negative emotions."
Here we've tried to see it in other races.
He pointed out that dogs were responsible for the left hand and the opposite order of the brain, like humans, and that two unions played different roles in feelings.
To learn more about how dogs respond to a side-on-modic move by other dogs, researchers have seen animals looking at other dogs' films.
They calculated the tears of pet dogs and their behavior.
We probably won't think more of why their misery sometimes moves on the other side.
"We've treated dogs with movies - in realistic version or elsewhere that confuses them, and we could see the behavior of the tail and offer the tail more or more to the left or to the right."
When he saw a cold dog shaking his tail on his tail, they were at ease.
But when he looked at the tail changing direction to the left, their heart was stirred and they looked suspicious.
They don't think the dogs were deliberately talking to each other by means of these behaviors.
Instead, they think that dogs have learned from their own experience what they should be concerned about and who is not.
He said: "If you've met other dogs several times, and if they shake their tail on the side constantly, it's more friendly, and the right part offers less friendly treatment, you react to the same experience."
Researchers say that these conclusions can give employers, animals, and educators better information about the feelings of animals.
John Bradesh, specialist at the University of Bristol's School of Sciences, reported that dogs's behavior is not the first study to check whether the dogs have a left or right part of it.
Last year, the team of the University of Linkan found that dogs turned their heads back to the left and looked at the happy dog.
In other research at the University of Victoria in Canada, he explained: "In contrast with the Italian study - when a robot dog's tail was moved to the left, the dogs were more likely to be worried than to get nervous."
He said that the difference was because dogs in different studies didn't understand every sense of animal or animal dogs in movies.
He explained that it could help to study ways of responding to the dogs.
"When there's plenty of evidence from various breast-bones that the two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more extensive information remains - and in this case dogs are not exceptions."
However, seeing how easy their behavior is to be recorded, it seems that we'll probably not find more time to understand why their misery sometimes moves on the other side.
The Arctic Mangaz left Glass Gigford because of the illness of Alex Terner

Pope Francis will announce the name of the first cardinal in February
The Vatican has announced Thursday that Pope Francis 22 on February 20, he will make the Catholic Church a new cardinal.
Cardinals, the highest class in the Catholic Church, have priests, whose office is above only the pope, and these choose the pope, so Francis will cooperate with the first group of his men, who will eventually support their successor.
Now there are total 201 cardinals.
Similarly, after reaching 80 years of age, Cardinal would not have been allowed to share in the pope's election - it comes into the group of 120 "cardivor."
In a speech announcing the news, the Vatican's spokesman Sir Fasbo Lobard said that before the ceremony of the new cardinals was instituted, all the existing cardinals would be held to the meeting of cardinals, called the Pope-Remethete.
Lombardi said, " Francis has already decided to let his decision to hold the popeship of February, in order to make it easier to plan another meeting shared by various countries of the world.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Vesez said that by February there was a chance to reduce the number of cardinal elections.
In general, the popes announce the name of the cardinals, as many as are from 120 years old, and the names of cardinals who live over 80 years of age.
Valerro said that it would be important for the next year, since this year it would be the first pope meeting in March after Francis was selected.
There's now a nature of prejudice toward Europe and Italy.
He said, "It will be interesting to see what the new popes do even more than the rest of the world to replace balance.
In South America there are 40 percent Roman Catholics, but in Cardinals they have very little number.
Francis's Cardinals Council - a group of eight cardinals from all over the world - whose work is to seek reform methods of the Church, these are the first cardinals to be chosen after they are adopted.
Before the pope decided all things himself.
Well, Valéro said, "now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help himself."
He's going to ask for such advice from Francis Cardinals.
But we're not in this situation before-- it's absolutely new.
Valerro said that the popes generally post cardinals of large places, but Francis was "a great surprise - so we don't know whose name they will declare."

The despair of Obama's votes
I voted twice over to Obama instead of changes.
He says that the policy of the GPPP has caused Obama's greatest efforts
The policy of the blocking website can't excuse drone attacks
The memory of 2008 Campen, who was of the past two years, reminds us of what could have been
Neusanian P. Moris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I read very painful books today.
This is a book about which I think it will warm my heart during the second year during the poison of the medical school, and give me hope.
His name's "Bellivation of the Year," and it's the grandfather Obama's President of 2008's Presidential Choice campaign.
When I spend the night with my patients and go to bed and this book takes me to a period in which politics inspired millions of people and could hold your breath.
Choice proved to be one side, and reports passed from time to time to show the historical significance of that time.
The eyes of my classmates were glad, and my father and my mother saved every news to come.
The young telescopes were going to the White House, and the whole country was ready to change.
He had 82 percent approval rating when he became the president of Obama in 2008.
And then I stopped the book.
The present truth is a hard truth, such as coming back from the world of dreams.
It's hard to remember those days of hope - they seem to be a far one, a sad memory of lost opportunities.
There was actually a change through me for the first time when the vote went into action.
Simply put, no one could ever imagine it.
I owe Obama to a lot of accomplishments, from Aured Cot to ant, and from Irak to our army's return, "Don't ask," until the end of Obama Bon died.
Besides, I believe the policy of combating partial opposition has prevented many efforts to advance our country: including public options for public health care, cleaning facilities at Guanajua Bay, besides others.
But a Number of times I took sides with my colleagues and colleagues in favor of the alien administration, and finally I'd end up with what I could give them.
I've reached the point of political despair.
Republican's opposition is not the answer of the policy of foreign leaders, nor is the answer to drone attacks on innocent children in foreign lands.
The National Security agency cannot answer providing data about the personal life of American citizens or the government to blame those who reveal wrong behavior.
It can't tell the reason for the murder of an anti-Valique American citizen without a test, nor of less public funding during President Campen's Camp.
It can't answer the conclusions of the report, which says that the attempt by the White House to silence Miito has been "the most aggressive since the European administration."
And most recently it can't make the failure of a simple website to design a simplified website after it was signed by Aured Krex.
I don't know if I really expected it.
If, at age 18, I should have calculated that the regime could deny the political campaign that led to it.
It's obviously not a traditional way, since the anti-conceptions and random events, such as the Newtown Baptists, will give shape to our public discussion.
Yet all the examples I've given up seem to have been chosen by the administration for themselves.
That bothers you most.
I emigrated in 2012 for Obama, but not because I was thrilled with his baptism.
The Romanre presented a confusing and unpercustomable option, which didn't appear to determine their policies or their positions.
I thought that a second act for Obama, which would be free from the pressure of future elections, will satisfy the hopes we've been hearing for a long time.
Yet, when Obama's secondary ratings are less than 45 percent this week, it has become very difficult to return to 2008 by means of that publication.
Seeing him I remember their promises for gone away.
This week there was reading a portion of the book, described in detail how Clinton had a huge loss on account of Ostienne in Pennsylvania.
At a post-mmy camp meeting he told his servants that they needed to return to the track, and be true to their purpose.
He said, "I want to get my Mos back."
We should remember who we are.'
I can't agree with you anymore, Mr. President.
The ideas expressed in this comment belong to the Neusanian Moris.
Cleve Palmer claimed that the PM is a good struggle about the Pentecostal holiday plan
Arabaire M.P.P.P.P.P. said that Prime Tony Abt had a good struggle about the Pentecostal holiday plan because their daughters could become pregnant, and they could take advantage of it.
Grandry of the mineland area, who is in controversy with the payment of $300 dollars, claims while he has tried to answer questions about the struggle.
The Pormer can control the United Party to four votes, which can be important in determining how to reduce carbon-Dlatifications.
But Mr. Palmer claims that there can only be a struggle for counselors, saying that the daughters of Mr. Ablot can benefit personally from policy.
Mr. Palmer said, "It can be an important struggle for them in the case of a social holiday, because if any daughter of theirs gets pregnant, they'll have an obvious interest in having vacations or not met."
Two months after the election, the election commission has officially announced Mr. Pamer to Fairs's Bearer's ears at 53 stations of Fairs' Street once again.
Mr. Palmer asked for a roundline of a round-up, to reach the process faster than speed.
The daughters of Tony Etote, Francisco and Bridge.
Should the choice result in our two months of vote?
He said, "We must have a better system."
Why can't we have a system in which we fill our computer, vote immediately, and get the results at 6:30.
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of Pensil to mark the papers.
This is because if a person does not like him, he or she may be able to wipe it out?
The use of pencils in today's rounds is really absurd.
The election commission is studying options for electronic votes, and recently a joint symposium with NewG magazine has issued.
59-year-old Mr. Palmer said that his policies are to be built into a international airport, and they will take their new job to "surply."
Public office is for public service.
He said, "We have the prize of history that we can serve the community on this important time, and we don't need any awards."
That had to make trouble for the builders.
Addressing the meeting held on this occasion, Barde-dolgar Singh poured a severe blow on the worse law-law in the country.
He proves that criminals are becoming more vulnerable to attacks on the U.S. windows and their government.
They have no fear of police and administrative order.
He recently mentioned such events as these in different places, saying that it is easy to imagine the safety of the common man when the community is not protected.
RBS tracked two level traders
The Royal Bank of Scottberg has transformed two traders from their foreign U.S. exchange departments, the case has received this information from two people who were disassociated, which is another indication that the global testing in the market is moving swiftly.
Some of the world's largest banks, with UBS barchage, Dsh Banks and RBS, have confirmed that the world's largest financial market, with a population of $5.3 Trillian, is the world's largest financial market, which exchanges $5 per day, they're at the trial-transition.
These two traders will be the first staff of RBS, to be checked with the case that appears to appear to have a recesssion of the rBS.
The bank has confirmed that a bank has been requested to report this month to the nuns.
Two weeks ago the bank said, "Our investigation in this case continues, and we're working full cooperation with FCA and others."
The previous month, the case said that RBS sent the former trader and sent records of new mail and quick messages from them to the UK, financial rights authorization.
This trader named Richard Hecker left RBS in 2010, and it is thought to have been released from its present position on the European head of W.P.P. spots of Europe.
The head of European spots in the city went to the holiday holiday, while the former Activist trader in Barcage and UBS was not impressed by this week's photographed chart.
None of these traders have been accused of any wrong action.
The case said that Mr. Usharer's quick message group includes barlasage and the bankers of Sigrupe.
UBS said that after being informed by symbs, mammama, she's been diagnosed with a lot of foreign currency testing the market's suspecting a lot of syphilis in the back, this week she has acted against some of her employees.
At least six authorizations on global level - Europeian commissions, virtueship of FCA, the competition of Switzerland, the justice department in FCA, US, and Hong Kong are testing charges of being shot off to the government market for their acceptance.
People familiar with the case told them that, HSBC, Citygroups, J.P.m.m.m.
The bank has carefully checked the quick message and email in looking for a clue to a wrong activity.
The news about testing, has caused a stir in the traders of the area, which have been among the most useful people who profit in the business unit over the past several years, but they are facing this challenge because they have been missing out on less-way opportunities in the case because they missed out on less-way opportunities.
Some bankers tried to suppress the case by saying that a lot of giant and highly favored foreign currency is impossible view in the Exchange market, but the senior traders say that this isn't necessarily true.
The senior trader said that despite the enormous magnitude of foreign sales trade-seasing sales platforms, the distribution of the Liquid business platforms and the increased use of his own plate platforms means that you can begin to affect the market on less tickets value."
The news came the same day when Mr. Wells proclaimed business to the merchant from his Exeter trading tax desk in London this week, which ended at the end of the last year, about $6 million.
The bank immediately notifys the consistent authorizations and cooperates with his orders.
"We believe that trader worked alone, and he has been controlled."

During the formal ceremony shown in the lively radio on national television, Morsi said that "We're looking for better futures, new Egypt and other republics."
The fanatic group, who has served as a 84 - year illegal declared organization since its establishment, and who has been on the target of the previous governments, said that 60 - year - old engineer in U.S.A., said that Egypt's people have laid the foundation for new life - perfect freedom, true democracy, and stability.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building, and soon after 11: 00 p.m. the little pair of cars came to Mori in the mates of the car, just as the local time had been.

On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath in the book Savre, which is the origin of the revolution, which ended the previous year the tyrant rule of blessing, and swore to take back the President's office from their office, which was taken away from the military council last year.
But rather than consenting to the Supreme Court's official oath, they surrender to the military's will, which indicates that the struggle will continue for power.

Moving through rivers and forests to provide the sultan medical care
According to Dr. George Wel, in the rural areas of Cameroon, there is a health - care service
Wel and his crew watch hundreds of sick patients on almost every weekend.
West African countries don't have much more medical; there's only a doctor for 5000 people
Give your votes here or use mobile
Dr. Georges Wels, in 2013, is one of the 10 heros in the top of C.N.
You can vote for them or for someone at other top 10.n.n. Year's hero.
The winning person will get $50,000 to continue his extraordinary job.
For 21 years, Georges Wel had seen his sick father coming to his senses and unconscious, going to the hospital, who had not been properly equipped to help him.
Gealel, in 1981, was injured in a car accident by Jadal, the capital of Cameroon.
He had only broken hands in the beginning, but an infection that spread to his brain grew, and he developed a blood clot, which affected his remaining life.
Georges Wel says, "There was no New Rosesberg in Kuron."
If we had money, we would have taken our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, they went about with their father, with a great multitude of clinics and hospitals, and received whatever help they could receive.
He said, "It's not easy."
You leave home at 5: 00 a.m. hoping you'll be the first person to reach the hospital, but it's not.
There are many sick ones.
Some can leap into death waiting.
The situation didn't change very much since Vel's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there's only one physician for every 5000 person in Cameroon.
If compared, there's a physician for every 413 persons in the United States.
If there are doctors there, even many of Cameroon's inhabitants can't afford it.
Two out of five live under the poor line in the country, and about two thirds of the addictions that are in health care in the country are of private area.
They say, "They have the only problem of poverty."
And being poor, they can't enjoy their lives.
When they saw the pain of their father, and of their own people, they determined to solve it.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers last year have been a medical doctor.
They became medical themselves, and began working as such a surgeon in Valdénel.
And they started out with the non-Cald organization Akovam, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide the professional medical services.
Since 2008, they and their own groups have helped some 33,000 people.
About Friday they sit in the van and about 30 people, lock medical supplies from the roof, and go to rural areas where people need medical attention.
Sometimes luck doesn't happen to them either.
They have to push the vehicle out of rivers and dust over once.
But when they reach, they really have the honor of the heros: the best residence offered by the feast, singing, dancing, and community.
These villages are actually the cause of the television medical service to celebrate, and Vel - along with their great smiles and endless energy - include joy and joy.
Next morning their team starts meeting hundreds of patients.
They said, "We're meeting 500 people each trip."
They come from village to about 60 mmys away, and they walk on.
All these weekends clinics provide various medical services.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, heart disease, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can find a nested source, taxed source, or birthless evidence -- this document takes on school, but most poor families cannot afford it.
In the evening, the crew performs simple surgery with the local noun.
Operations are usually done at school, Town Hall or Home; after procedure, sickness passes and leads to a relief site, and makes space for the next person.
The group's generator published in the operating room and the sanitizing devices, and Vel and their cars get up early on Sunday morning and work.
It's a blouse speed, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team under move.
They said, "They keep us awake and play the drum all night to continue their work."
On Sunday his party returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
This group - including the medical and foreign medical students in Cameroon - has 700 Hospital Liaison Committees last year, and they know that their help can change the world of those whom they help.
One said that the patient would be able to go back to work again because she received medical treatment.
The man said, "The future of me and my family will be changed."
Besides running a weekend clinic and working as a doctor at the hospital, he also works on a personal medical clinic around Jadin at night.
He pointed out that it's their second job that costs 60% of their work; the rest's part is filled with personal contributions.
"I don't know when they're sleeping," said Cati O'amly Oli, a second - year medical student at Dryxley University in Philadelphia.
They're always at the hospital, or they're trying to make money for their organization, so that they can keep up with the campaign.
It is a practical occasion for students like O'Males, who come from the United States and Europe to join the Weal campaign, which they can never obtain in their country.
O'Maley said, "In the popular medical care we help to catch the tool for Dr. Welel, in which we're able to get a practical experience."
You will never have the opportunity to do that as a second - year medical student in America.
The volunteers usually live by themselves to reach Cameron, and they usually come with the medical supply of Dan.
But after they have reached it, they go and go, and they carry the expenses of the instructions.
O'Maley says, "No doubt they're hero."
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help Cameroon's people will never end.
For Val, nearly a bit of work, it's not hard.
Helping others live happy lives, fulfill your promise to your father, these are the things that bring them great joy.
They say, "I'm very happy when I do this."
And I think of my father.
I hope they'll see what I'm doing.
I'm doing it to make people laugh, lower their pain.
