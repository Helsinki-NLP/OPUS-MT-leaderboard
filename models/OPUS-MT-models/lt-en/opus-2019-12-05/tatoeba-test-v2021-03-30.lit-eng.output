She knows exactly what she wants.
Hey.
Did Tom forgive you for what you did last week?
Good morning, it's time to wake up.
The baby was crying all night.
She didn't like life in town.
This size is too big for me.
It won't change anything.
Do as you like.
The man you saw last night is my uncle.
I don't like winter.
I gave Tom a chance.
We played golf despite the rain.
What kind of test is that?
He told me his life story.
I decided to be happy because it's good for my health.
I'll wait here until he gets back.

You have to do the same thing.
It's simple and intuitive.

She asked me who came first.
Sooner or later, we're all going to die.
How long will it take?
It's a shadow.
Where is the German Embassy?
Be friendly.
This rose is amazing.
But he knew it couldn't go on.
I guess not.
I want it too!
She's watching, but she doesn't see anything.
He can't eat anything sweet today.
She's eating.
I'd like to travel around the world.
Do you like Italian?
I got five years in jail.
I'm a loser.
Any universe that is simple enough to understand it is too simple to create a mind that can understand it.
We didn't have to hurry.
Please?
It doesn't matter which team will win the match.
He's running.
This dress is too big for me.
Go and get up to your car.
Bring her a plate of salad.
We are in war.
She didn't answer.
I heard Mary wants a divorce.
Is this stallion or the stallion?
My father's coming home tomorrow.

You guys are the best shooters.
How can you say something like that?
Be careful!
Obviously you've done this before.
Did you get a letter?
Two years ago, I couldn't play basketball at all.
What's the difference?
You're guilty.
She rejected my request.
Which one do you prefer?
I like Korean food.
I was invited to dinner.
You're still green.
There's nothing here.

Everybody likes dolls.
What did you do to deserve this?
Look at the example at the top.
Her hat looked very funny.
I wanted to be a philosopher.
You're not fast enough.
We left the door open.
Can you come back at 9: 00?
Why did you call?
They discussed that problem.
If I hadn't received his help, I'd be dead.
He was almost asleep.
I have one brother.
Why did you come here?
Do you like this color?
Isn't it strange that Thomas is not here at the moment?
A million people lost their lives during the war.
Compare your sentence with that on the board.
She met him cheerfully.
They need our help.
Did you get Tom's message?
I don't like how he talks.
I don't know what's going on with me anymore.
I learned a lot from him.
He killed that guy.
Don't expect too much.
That brown hat is old.
He's playing golf every Sunday.
Be creative.
I couldn't understand what he said.
Close the gate.
I'm always tired.
He's a weird guy.
Go back to your place.
Be friendly.
Isn't that a beautiful morning?
That's a story.
I have more and more gray hair.
He turned the light off.
I'm not sleeping.
The sky is blue.
The old woman fell and couldn't get up.
They fell asleep after the movie.
You can use my vocabulary.

You like Tom.
He rarely stays at home on Sundays.
When would you like to see him?
Tom started shouting for help.
His son's eight.
If I had wings, I'd fly to you.
Where the hell are you going?
He promised me he'd be more careful in the future.
What time did you hear a shot?
I forgot to buy one pillow.
I've heard a lot about you.
We're going to eat lunch.
Italy is a very beautiful country.
It's an old boughnut.
Eat bread!
Even though he lives in the United States, Tom can't speak English.
The school is five kilometers from my house.
I gave up my weapons.
Who ate all our food?
I know her bread will be delicious.
Please come.
Women change the world.
In Singapore, spitting on the floor is considered a crime.
I wanted Mary to love me instead of Tom.
You can sit on the chair.
We need more sugar.
The smell of the roses filled the room.
Evil wins sometimes.
Tom already drank three cups of coffee.
I don't understand German.
Yes, please.
I'll help you.
You're guilty.
What are you looking for?
What does that mean?
Apples are the sweetest on the other side of the wall.
Who's there?
I'm studying Japanese.
It's pointless.
She had a woman's head, a lion's body, a bird's wings, and a serpent's tail.
Tell me how you solved that problem.
Would you like to dance with me?
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't explain what happened there.
I'm afraid of heights.
I don't know where to go.
If it's not raining, then let's go.
Who's coming with me?
I agree.
Compare the facts.
I'm not hungry right now.
I'm going to France on vacation.
You can sit wherever you want.
You're an engineer.
The door is slowly opened.
That's a story.
Do you have any sport?
It's time for you to start a new business.
Let's wait here.
That girl I told you to live here.
Please just leave.
I can't believe she's older than my mother.
Look back and see the black cat.
His family traveled a lot.
Do you know him?
I don't know if to turn left or right.
I'll clean the kitchen later.
He came from a small town in the mountains.
I talked to my friends.
All your cats are gray.
I remember the time we had a picnic with you.
When we go to bed, we say good night.
The scandal ruined his career.
Cats are complex individuals.
He was so poor he couldn't even buy bread.
I suggest you ask Tom.
This bag is not small.
There's nothing wrong with that.
If you invite him, he'll probably come.
I know you know I know.
Go home before 6: 00.
Bread fresh.
I'll be back in half an hour.
I don't want to be a bad guy anymore.
Are you a lawyer?
Where's your school?
Candles lit up the room.
I'm sorry.
Fold the paper in half.
What does he write in a letter?
A woman eats bread.
I'm eating an apple.
The lonely man gets pleasure watching ants.
Who's the man who's sitting at the other end of the table?
Are you pregnant?
I'm really tired now.
His steps have accelerated.
The eternal silence of these endless spaces frightens me.
Why do you need a new umbrella?
He drew a straight line on the wall.
You need a car?
Take your hat off when you're in class.
They don't do anything else but complain.
She was in a hurry.
Please contact me when you arrive at Boston.
Tom got up at 7: 00.
This is for us.
I'm listening to the radio.
The boy wants to know the truth.
Tom ate the whole pizza alone.
You have to take care of yourself.
You need patience, Tom.
How are you?
Your journey starts here.
Can you believe what he said?
Tom asked where you were.
I'd like to help, but I'm very busy.
Tom couldn't stop thinking about Mary.
I think we should call Tom.
Don't be late for the bus.
All the apples are there.
You'll have to pay.
What time should we go to the station?
The more I think about it, the less I like it.
I'll take you to a new store.
Everyone knows her.
She's incredibly naive.
Where do you live in Turkey?
Tom's gone.
I can't.
Get out of class.
There are three dogs sleeping on Mom's carpet.
Tom's finished the job he had to do.
If you can't have children, you could always adopt.
That's exactly what I was thinking.
Even though she ran as fast as she could, she still didn't get to the bus.
They need friends.
Beef, please.
Can you wrap it up like a present?
Do you like to live like that?
It's hot today, isn't it?
Are you sure you don't have a home?
Are you playing chess?
Her boyfriend is Turk.
Answer me.
My mother can't come.
There are a lot of aluders in Bavaria.
Do you know if he has a girlfriend?
I don't have a family.
The parents were expecting too much from their son.
What would you like to order, gentlemen?
He did it.
He entered my room without permission.
You can't just leave.
Come on, move!
You can sit on the chair.
Where do you live if you don't have a home?

We have to get out of here.
Tom doesn't want to do it again.
I asked her to wait a minute.
How long have you started learning the language of the Esperans?
They don't pose a threat.
Her advice led me to go abroad.
You're the only one who can help me.
What places does that tour visit?
That's why we played inside.
Your carpet is completely white.
But I don't want to.
I'm sorry I can't see you tonight.
Tom has a sister who is a lawyer.
I look like my mother.
You look just charming tonight.
Doctor, can you listen to me?
You know, don't you?
I hope to see him on Monday.
Tom changed his clothes.
It's hot, so be careful not to burn.
Did you find your letters?
For God's sake!
He doesn't remember whether that room was empty or not.

That tree grows by her house.
Don't talk in the scanner.
How you doing, miss?
I swapped the yen into dollars.
I hate winter.
I think Tom is going to kill Mary.
There are only two correct answers.
If I had been rich, I would have given you some money.
When and where did you meet her?
Where did you curse them?
Tom didn't show up.
Don't be so serious, it's just a game.
He told me a funny story.
I don't have time right now.
Tom is the captain of our team.
This carpet is very long.
Listen to what the teacher says.
Why is nobody eating my potatoes?
I asked Tom to play guitar.
What does that remind you of?
She literally made it.
What a great night!
I can't find Tim.
She called him Charles.

Just answer the question.
I don't want to be indebted to anyone.
Look at the train across the bridge.
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I'm really bored now.
No, I don't think I'm guilty.
Where are we?
I'm about five.
Her hat looked funny.
She's too young to understand that.
I bought this suit just for this occasion.
It's like that.
Be careful, okay?
That's the only explanation.
I can't believe I'm actually here.
Don't you know the way?
I really like that.

She's standing behind the wall.
Don't expect too much of me.
They missed a great opportunity.
Fight for your right.
He always talks to me when he meets me on the street.
Look at the book on the table.
I drank one beer and pretended to be very drunk.
Tom didn't think he needed a bodyguard.
Someone opened the door.
Do you have any questions about this lesson?
We saw her entering the park.
It doesn't look like you're busy.
It didn't look like you wanted that book.
I have a red bike.
It's low and fat.
I want to go to Tokyo.
The trip was tiring.
He's a lot smarter than me.

It's my fault.
Not bad, but I'm a little tired.
This is a wonderful idea.
He's very proud of his toy.
That's enough for us.
I'm not scared at all.
The woman wants to know the truth.
Is this word often used?

Can you come with us?
I don't care about him.
Tom couldn't find the reason why he needed to go home early.
Raise your hand.

Go open the door.
I told you I was gonna take another cat later.
