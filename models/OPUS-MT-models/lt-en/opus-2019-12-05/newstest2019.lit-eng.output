The 11th meeting of the MG Baltic trial held on Monday was attended by all the accused: Šarūnas Gustainis, Gintaras Steponavičius, Vytautas Gabšys, Eligjus Masiulis and Raimondas Kurlianski.
The hearing began with evidence from the accused.
At the last hearing, the new lawyer appointed by the State to Š. Gustainis Aleksandras Doroshev told the judicial panel before he had access to the case file.
Then MG Baltic lawyer Linas Belevičius stated that in order to ensure the full protection of the person, the judicial panel must allow the new lawyer to have access to the file of the case and asked for a hearing to be held.
"In order to ensure the protection of the person, he shall have access to the criminal file.
This is not just a formal sitting, "said L. Belevičius.
The new lawyer, Mr Dorošev, pointed out that he had not been able to acquaint himself with the indictment or with the entire file of the case.
At the previous trial, the suspect, Mr Gustaini, announced that he refused his lawyer because he could no longer pay him.
The hearing also included sound recordings.
The lawyers of the accused were outraged that the sound records submitted to the court were of poor quality.
The law enforcement suspect that politicians, taking bribes from MG Baltic, supported or initiated decisions in favour of the group in the Seimas and other state institutions, as well as had an impact on the winners of the public procurement, is reminiscent of ELTA.
More than 150 people were interviewed during the pre-trial investigation, of which more than 50 were Members of the last Parliament, several former ministers, Members of the European Parliament.
More than 200 interviews and more than 30 searches have been carried out.
It is suspected that Š. Gustainis received more than 8 thousand euros, G. Steponavičius - 15 thousand euros, V. Gapšys - more than 27 thousand E. Masiulis is suspected to have taken more than 106 thousand euros.
The Labour Party is suspected of bribery and trade, the Liberal Movement - bribery, trade and abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of buying and selling these parties.
Politicians are suspected to have consulted with the Vice-President of MG Baltic, R. Kurlianski, and subsequently offered or supported initiatives in the Seimas or other institutions that were favourable to the Group.
Ethical Keepers: The Liberal Movement's Board on the Law of Vilnius Division
"The decisions taken by the Board are in accordance with the statutes," - after the commission meeting the BNS announced its leader Vytautas Tamošiūnas.
"Our decision was not a new one.
We had already made an interpretation as a commission in July when the question of Pagėgiai and Utena was raised.
Then we said that, according to the statute, this is a matter of board competence.
And if the board decides that some department can behave as it wishes - go with the committee and the board agrees, then the department can go, but if the board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, what the board has adopted, then there is a decision that all sections form party lists.
And if you do not agree with the board, then there is an opportunity to suspend membership and go to the committee, "he added.
According to Mr Tamošiūnas, the governing board of the party will now decide on further action.
On the 17th of October, the Liberal Movement Board of the Party revoked the decision of Vilnius City Department to participate in municipal elections not with the list of the party but with the list of the newly-elected electoral committee.
In the opinion of the party board, the decision of the liberals of the capital to participate in the elections in the form of a public election committee violated the party's statutes and decisions of the board.
By October 31, Vilnius division had to cancel its aspirations to participate in municipal elections with the list of committee.
But the department didn't do it.
The former Head of the Division, Aušrine Armonaitė, has already left the Liberal Movement.
The Mayor of Vilnius, former Chairman of the Liberal Movement Remigijus Šimašius, who is promising to pursue another term of office as Head of the capital, has already presented the team and ideas of the public election committee "For Vilnius," which we are proud of! "
He left the party, too.
The election of municipal councils and mayors will take place in March of next year.
The inhabitants of the village located in North India ran a tiger, which had previously torn one man, reported on Monday by officials.
The Forest Care Officer, Mahvik Kaujlagi, said that when the tigrei was torn up late on Sunday by a man who worked in the field, the villagers surrounded the beast and, when the female tried to get out, ran it with a tractor.
The population says that this tiger was also attacked about 10 days ago and robbed one young man.
The village is located at the Dudhva Tiger Reserve in Lakhympur Kher District, approximately 250 km south-east of the capital of Uttar Pradesh in Laknau.
The use of tigers in protected areas is prohibited.
Rameshas Pandey, the director of the insurance company, said that the case would be reported to the police under the Wild Nature Conservation Act.
In April, the villagers beat another tiger in the District of Nighhaan of the State of Uttar Pradesh; he suffered severe injuries.
The tiger is an Indian national animal; under the Conservation Act, tigers are regarded as an endangered species.
Last year's government data show that during the last three years, at least one person would die every day in the encounter with wild tigers or elephants.
The number of human conflicts with tigers has gradually increased since the 1970s, when India launched a tiger protection programme, which set up reserves in national parks, and the gerbering of large cats has been criminalised.
Although the methods of calculating tigers have changed, censuses would show that the then population of about 1,800 tigers grew to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
It is proposed that cats and dogs should be labelled with microchips
Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environment, together with other Members of the Seimas, has registered amendments to the Animal Welfare and Protection Act, which suggests that cats and dogs must be labelled with subcutaneous microchips.
"We offer that cats and dogs must be labelled with subcutaneous microchip, and their registration and labelling should be organised by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Office.
In 2019, all dogs will be labelled free of charge, and in 2020 cats will also be labelled, so people will not be concerned and the costs will be covered by special public funding, "said Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Seimas Committee on the Environment.
The amendments to the law aim to address the systemic need for the labelling of domestic animals.
It is expected that this will help to avoid problems caused by irresponsible livestock farmers, illegal breeders or sellers.
It is provisionally estimated that, on the basis of the expected average cost of providing a microchip and a service of around EUR 5, all owners of animals will be reimbursed during the transitional period.
The total cost of marking all pets can be up to EUR 6 million.
It is planned that the demand for these funds will be spread over three years and will reach EUR 2 million each year.
It is expected that labelling programmes will be allocated through a special programme to support the environment of municipalities, the revenue of which will increase significantly this year due to increased taxes and reallocations of natural resources.
The municipalities will be able to use these funds not only for cat and dog labelling, but also for castration and other programmes.
According to Mr Mažeika, compulsory labelling practices are common in almost all countries of the European Union, which also protects animals themselves (because the lost can easily be returned to the owners), and saves the time of the animal farmers themselves when the search for the escaped and lost pet takes a lot of time and money.
In addition, EU legislation provides that travel is only possible with marked pets.
At the same time, labelling obliges the animal to take responsible care of its entire life.
Previous proposals for compulsory labelling have been opposed because the programmes concerned have been proposed for funding from the population.
"The current model should avoid this criticism, as animal protection is proposed to be financed by increased income in the environmental promotion programme and the right to label not only to veterinarians but also to the public, i.e. individuals of animal care institutions who have listened to specific courses in the Veterinary Academy," says the project authors.
The draft law was registered by a group of Members of the Seimas representing different groups of the Seimas - Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupšinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.

"Women lie better" star actress B. Arsobaitė is persecuted by liars
It's probably just a coincidence, but the charming brown actress Brigita Arsobaitė is already getting the role of liars on a few occasions.
Initially the series "Women are lying better," then the performance "Melagės" and finally the comedy "Melagiai."
In this film Brigita plays a square wife of the hero of Dainius Kazlauskas.
"I very much enjoyed filming in the" Melagiai, "because I am more of a theatre actress and I rarely appear in a movie.
The excellent team of colleagues gathered has promised an excellent result from the very beginning.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened on the court was a puppy Sunny!
All my life, I thought if I had a dog, it would really be big and serious.
I've never been fascinated by those little, decorative "fifs" four feet.
But during the film, Sunny so attached to me that sympathy became mutual and eventually I even wanted to buy it from the host, but not successfully, "she smiles at the actress.
From the very first few minutes, the new Lithuanian comedy "Melagiai," produced by the Lithuanian cinema hits "Inexperienced" and "Among us, boys..." producer Paulius Virbickas and producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimir Razarionov, is in the family's comic and intriguing peripathetics.
Your beloved has just told me she's pregnant.
That would be great news, but... your beloved is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
Without being able to announce "good news," parents suddenly state - they are different!
Fifty years later, together...
And all this happens just before the most beautiful holidays of the year - Christmas!
But the end will surprise even more, because no one expected such an atom.
All heroes are not what they looked like at first glance...
In addition to B. Arsobaitė's comedy "Melagiai" a good mood for the audience gifts four times the movie stars: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita Ušaitė, Giedrė Giedraitytė, Lubomir Laucevičius, Larisa Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Girgovinis.
Comedy "Melagiai" - in cinemas since 9 November
Deciding whether to write off EUR 100 million of outstanding taxes on emigrants
On Tuesday, the Seimas adopted the amendment of the Law on the Declaration of Residence by "peasant" leader Ramūnas Karbaussky.
56 Members of the Seimas voted in favour, 9 against and 25 abstentions.
The Seimas will continue to discuss the amendments on or after 6 December, following the government's conclusion.
According to R. Karbauskis, these contributions are calculated for people who did not declare their departure from Lithuania.
According to parliamentarians, in three years one person does not pay about 1 000 euros, and now there are about 100 000 such persons.
Social democrat Algirdas Says regretted that, in this way, the Seimas will 'call for some people to' opt out '- declare departure and then no taxes would be counted.
The Conservative Antanas Matulas, a member of the Committee on Health Affairs, has noted that Lithuanians living abroad are using the fact that they come to Lithuania for treatment by paying a low health insurance fee - they are provided with the same services as those paying it to the residents.
The amendments provide that those who leave Lithuania will be considered as those who will pay social security contributions in the countries of the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation, while "Sadra" will exempt them from paying health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
The leader of "Sodra" Mindaugas Sinkevičius has previously said that such a step will facilitate both the life of emigrated people and the activity of "Sodra."
A video on the Internet about a lying bear reveals a serious problem
It's like a mother's bear climbs up on a snowy slope, and a little boy keeps climbing, slipping down and climbing again.
The video received numerous views and comments.
People were admired by the persistence of a little bear - often slipping down and climbing to his mother again.
He does not succeed at the first time, but the little one doesn't even try to give up and finally achieves his goal.
The video is really focused, but it also reveals the threat that people pose to animals.
Scientists claim that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people's desire to know wild nature can sometimes be harmful.
"It's obvious to me that the bear drone was very frightened.
Their movements show that they're panic.
If they didn't fly drone around, they would probably have chosen a safer road or overcome it more slowly or more carefully.
This is a great example of how drones should not be used, "the Verge said ecologist Mark Ditmer.
Some time ago, Mr Ditmer, together with his colleagues, studied how drones affect bears.
The animals were fitted with heart work gauges.
When the drone came near, some bears came down, others didn't run anywhere, but all their hearts started to beat more often.
Scientists advise drones for animals to film to use responsibly, not to fly too close, not to raise noise and not to fly where is forbidden.
The escaped president was contacted through the newspaper
On Tuesday, the court of Kiev invited President Viktor Yanukovych, who had resigned to Russia, to attend the betrayal hearing of the alleged state in an unusual way, and published the summons in the official publication of the State.
In the courtroom published in the government news paper "Uriadova kurjer," the former leader is invited to attend the hearing of the criminal proceedings on 19 November, during which his final arguments could be heard.
The document states that Mr Yanukovych is entitled to attend the hearing by video.
On October 30, the court of Kiev declared that it had closed the debate in the case of V. Janukovych.
Aleksandr Gorosynski, a lawyer working in Russia, was given the opportunity to register in the Register of Foreign Lawyers before 19 November so that he could attend a meeting where V. Janukovych is expected to share his last word by video link.
The Kremlin-sponsored Yanukovych was overthrown and fled to Russia during the Maidan uprising in February 2014, provoked by the President's refusal to sign an association agreement with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former Ukrainian leader was taken to Russia through a special operation organised by Moscow.
In March of that year, Russia was annexing Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, and a bit later there was a war between Kiev and Russian-sponsored separatists in the east of the country.
Since then, the fighting has brought about 10 000 lives, despite numerous attempts by the international community to secure a lasting ceasefire.
The list of Conservatives to Vilnius City Council will be held by Valdas Benkunskas
The former Minister of Economy, Dainius Kreivys, has already been approved as a Conservative candidate for the year.
During the initial elections of the Conservatives, the members of the party ranked the list of candidates for the Vilnius City Municipality Council.
As the party reports, V. Benkunskas, Chairman of the TS-LKD Vilnius Division Conference, became the leader of the Conservative List.
In the first 10 candidates, the members of the Vilnius City Municipal Council Paulė Kuzmickienė, Adam Bužinskas, Gediminas Švilpa, Audrius Skystis, Rasa Bashkienė, former Seimas member Lukaugas Kazavickas, Mantas Benkunskas, Arūnas Valinskas and Goda Karazijaitė were present.
Direct elections of mayors and municipal councils will take place in Lithuania on March 3 of next year.
Restrictions on cogeneration plants brought before the Constitutional Court
The Seimas opposition, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (KT) against the ruling of the management of the law on the possibility of suspending the construction of waste incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the Seimas opposition group of the Homeland Union - Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) announced that the group of Members of the Seimas had applied to the CST to investigate the conformity of the amendments to the Law on Waste Management adopted by the rulers with the Constitution.
"The Members stress that the provisions of the law aim to question the current waste-incineration plant projects by entrusting the government with new restrictions (20 km from the area of residence) to the entry into force of the law on the construction of waste-incineration plants started in Vilnius and Kaunas," says the report.
"The parliamentarians point out that, in view of the wording of the law of the prohibition on the construction of objects of national importance for the management of waste (i.e. the definition of distance and the definition of the concept of" residence territory "), it must be concluded that this prohibition is a disproportionate restriction or even a negation of the very nature of the right to carry out economic activities relating to the incineration of waste for the production of energy, since the criteria laid down are formulated in such a way that, having regard to the density and distribution of the population of Lithuania, it would be practically impossible to construct such objects throughout the entire territory of the country,"
It is claimed that the law adopted is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
"The CST has repeatedly indicated that the legislation does not apply to legal facts and effects which have arisen before the entry into force of the newly adopted act.
In this case, the government is empowered to apply the law retroactively on the basis of an uncertain criterion.
The introduction of such a legal regulation violates the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal certainty, protection of legitimate expectations, and hence the constitutional principle of the rule of law, "refers to appeal.
It also notes that significant financial investments have already been made in Vilnius and Kaunas cogeneration power plant projects.
The suspension of the current projects would not only result in a 100-year financial loss, a huge loss and an increase in heating costs for the Lithuanian population, as a result of the increasing amount of waste landfilling increased environmental pollution.
Members from the Seimas TS-LKD, Deputy Senator Algirdas Butkevičius of the Liberal Movement, Social Democratic Groups and the Management Working Group of Social Democrats signed the call.
A couple of weeks ago, the Seimas was able to collect 71 votes in the vote to reject the amendments to the Waste Management Act adopted by President Dalia Grybauskaitė's veto, which provided for the government's right to stop the construction of cogeneration plants that had already begun, and also established a zone of 20 km from the "quarantine" of residential areas for the construction of such power plants.
The amendments adopted by the Seimas will enter into force on 1 January 2019.
This proposal is to be discussed in the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, the right of the Government to suspend projects that have already begun is not planned to be waived.
KT will deal with the case in turn at least one year later.
Delivered the question-raising statistics of LeBron James in Lakers' club
The beginning of LeBron James's career at the Lakers Club in Los Angeles is not what he expected, the organization and basketball fans.
Lakers started the season with four victories and six defeats, and such a weak start has led to rumours about the possible release of coach Luke Walton.
However, these speeches were reassured by President Magico Johnson, who stated that he would not forgive the coach, but that he needed to play better.
The biggest team star, L. James, should look back to himself.
Although the statistics of the attacker are usually impressive - 26.8 point, 7.6 rebound ball and 7.7 effective transmission.
But she's not telling the whole truth.
In the first 10 matches of the season, other figures showed that Lakers are playing better when there is no James on the square.
The attacker is unfavorable + / - statistics showing how many points more are thrown or missed by the crew when there are certain players on the field.
This is when Mr James is on the field, Lakers spent 30 points more in this season than the competitors.
When he was sitting on the bench, the "lakes" got 19 points more than the competitors.
Currently, Lakers are only at the 13th place at the Western conference, but several victories can turn everything over the upper leg.
Spain will continue to contribute to the protection of Lithuanian airspace
The meeting noted that Spain will contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
"Lithuania appreciates Spain's cooperation in NATO and its significant contribution to the security of our country and region," Minister Linkevičius said.
The Spanish air force has already carried out NATO air police and air police strengthening missions in the Baltic States five times, three times in Lithuania.
For the last time, the Spanish Eurofighter fighters were deployed in Šiauliai in May-August this year.
In addition, Spain will contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
The Minister also noted that regular consultations on security, political, economic and strategic communication in the fight against propaganda are taking place between Lithuania and Spain.
Linas Linkevičius expressed his hope that Lithuania and Spain will continue to work closely together on the European, transatlantic agenda and other multilateral issues.
Since 2004, when Spain opened its embassy in Vilnius, Ambassador Jose Maria Robles Fraga is the fifth Spanish representative in Lithuania.
On October 29, Maria Robles Fraga presented letters of division to President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
V. Ačienė about R. Acho's detention: I believe in man's innocence and law enforcement
"To me it was the most unexpected thing I could never think of.
On the other hand, the services are probably doing the work they have to do.
Everyone is doing their job.
I believe in law enforcement, I believe in my husband that everything is fair and honest, that no unfair actions of him should be done, "said V. Ačienė.
R. Ačas was detained by the Special Investigation Service (STT) on Monday - the law enforcement suspect that he, while being the director of the Raseiniai Municipality administration, took a significant prize, and in return he could create exceptional conditions for a private company that signed a contract with the Raseiniai bus park.
Representatives of private companies are suspected of having bought Mr Ača directly or of having participated in various financial operations involving bribes.
The Raseiniai district Municipal Council, R. Ačas, in April of this year, was dismissed from the office of head of administration by the third attempt after the stated mistrust.
He was a member of the newly established Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party, Gediminas Kirkkilas, who suspended his membership of this party on Monday.
Mr Ačas failed to stand for the mayor elections a few years ago as a representative of the electoral committee "Ty Raseiniai."
V. Ačienė says that a man did not intend to stand for the Raseiniai mayor elections next year, but had not yet decided whether to participate in the municipal councils elections.
V. Ačienė was elected to the Seimas with the list of Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union, she is a member of the Seimas Commission on Anticorruption.
The politician says she will be waiting for further law enforcement action, depending on whether or not she will be excluded from the work of the Commission.
"Sudden decisions I'm not doing today, this week I think I'll decide.
I will see if there is a necessity, what kind of accusations have been made, I will of course make one decision or another.
I guess I need to stay away from all the things that are being investigated in the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again - it's all time to put it in place, "she said.
The representative of the opposition Conservatives at the Seimas Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė invited the Seimas President Viktoras Pranckienė and the head of the "peasant" Ramūnas Karbauski to depart from the statements of the group's colleague Vida Ačienė and to withdraw her from the Seimas Commission on Anticorruption by transferring her to another parliamentary committee or commission.
She claims that the further work of Mr Ačienė in the Committee of the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission "would lead to public mistrust and discredit the work of an important parliamentary supervision commission."
Feeling music of "Coldplay" was also interested in famous Lithuanian pairs
During the autumn Monday evening, a lot of music and film lovers gathered for the early premiere of the film "Coldplay: A Head Full of Dreams."
The event came from a whole group of famous people: John and Simona Nainius, Ignas Lelys, Martynas Sila and many others.
The film tells the story of one of the most popular British postage groups "Coldplay," which intersects with moments from concerts.
The documentary director Matas Whitecross met the group's guys even when they still played at the bars and gathered just a few dozen spectators.
You can see shots from the backstage of concerts, rehearsals or leisure.
The Vocalist and pianist Chris Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland met in 1996 in college and founded the Pectoralz group.
Soon, the Bosist Guy Berryman joined them, and a little later - and the drummer Willas Champion.
The group changed its name to "Coldplay" and exactly twenty years ago released its first record "Safety," which contained three pieces.
Of the 500 copies of the record, most were distributed to radio stations, producers and friends, and only 50 copies of Safety were traded.
Coldplay is a world-renowned, respected and beloved group that has released seven albums, sold over 100 million copies.
Over two decades, the group has won 107 different awards, including nine Brit Awards and seven Grammy.

Grybauskaitė calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU businesses
President Dalia Grybauskaitė invites China to create a more favourable investment environment for investments in the countries of the European Union (EU) and to facilitate foreign imports.
At the Shanghai Chinese import exhibition, opening up the trade and investment forum, Mr Grybauskaitė stressed that, in the face of signs of economic slowdown, the common goal of Europe and China should be to "unite efforts to stop the spread of protectionism in the world", which is the root causes of the tension caused by trade wars, "surplus production and unfair competition."
"China's commitment to a more attractive, open environment for investment is crucial for the European Union, which is important in negotiating a trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign businesses feel welcome and secure here, as well as strengthening the protection of intellectual property, "said D. Grybauskaitė.
According to her, China's opening is important not only for Europe, but also for this country, as well as for global economic growth.
The Lithuanian President stressed that the transparency of investments should be "above the interests of any business group."
"Transparency, the rule of law, strict compliance with international treaties - this must be essential for the new investment relationship for the environment," said D. Grybauskaitė.
"Corrupted capital flows should not be expected in any country of the world - not just here or in our countries," she added.
China's import exhibition is trying to mitigate the criticism that it avoids opening its market and protects only its companies.
The exhibition is attended by leaders of several states, more than 2800 companies from 130 countries and regions around the world, including Lithuania.
According to the Lithuanian Department of Statistics, China currently occupies 25 seats among export partners.
Last year Lithuania's exports to China increased by 50%, reaching 180 million euros.
At the same time, Chinese imports exceeded EUR 820 million.
Some officials are concerned that Chinese investment in Lithuania can bring unwanted political effects, and Beijing's exclusive focus on Eastern Europe is disintegrating EU unity.

The cause of the Lion Air accident was revealed: the relatives of the dead were angry
The data from the crashed black box of the Indonesian air carrier Lion Air showed that during at least four of its last flights there was a speed meter malfunction, reported by the investigators on Monday.
The chairman of the National Transport Security Committee (NTSC), Soerjant Tjahjon, said that a similar incident occurred during the last four flights of the aircraft, including the fatal one, when the liner fell on the Sea of Java on 29 October immediately after the launch of Jakarta.
All 189 people on the plane died during this accident.
Many media reported disturbances during the previous flight of the aircraft Boeing 737 MAX 8 from Denpasar to the capital of Indonesia.
"When we opened the black box - yes, in fact the technical problem was air speed, in other words airspeed," said Mr Tjahjon at the press conference.
"Black Box data showed that during two flights prior to the flight Denpasar-Jakarta was also the same problem," he added.
"There are many rumors in social networks.
Now we want to clarify that in the black box (data remained) about four flights in which there were problems with the air speed meter, "the head of the NTSC pointed out.
During the meeting with the deceased family members, Mr Tjahjon said that the information of the installation recording the flight data is in line with the messages that the speed and height of the aircraft had changed irregularly when the last flight had taken off.
Search teams have not yet found the second black box recording conversations in the cockpit.
Lion Air indicated that the technical failure detected during the flight from Bali to Jakarta had been corrected in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
One of the founders of the company, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to speak by the Minister of Transport Budi Karyos Sumadi, who modelled a family meeting with officials supervising the search and investigation of the remnants of aircraft and victims.
However, he stood up and bowed his head when the angry and distressing family members demanded that Mr Kirana, together with his brother Kusnan, who founded Lion Air in 1999, should introduce himself.
"Lion Air did not behave properly," said a man who presented himself as the father of the passenger Shandy Johann Ramadhan, who worked as a prosecutor on the island to which the plane flew.
"I want Mr Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention," he stressed.
- Lion Air has never contacted me since the crisis began.
We lost our child, but Lion Air did not show us any sympathy. "
After this meeting, Mr Kirana left in a hurry, avoiding the questions of journalists.
Many families are waiting for the results of a long process of identifying the dead.
Police medical experts have been handed over to almost 140 bodies of human remains.
Up to now, only 14 victims have been identified.
The relatives asked why two months ago the pilot-in-command was allowed to fly, even though during the 28 October flight from Bali to Jakarta there was a failure, including resulting in a sharp drop in the plane that frightened the passengers immediately after the take-off.
Lion Air said that this failure was removed.
Is it true that the problem has been solved? "asked the sons of one of the dead.
- If not, the technicians concerned must be brought to justice.
The law is very clear, not they said that the plane was allowed to take off again.
These bad technicians must respond to the law so that aircraft catastrophes do not recur in Indonesia.
Mr Tjahjon said that the large amount of fine debris and the fact that the debris spread out in a rather small area show that the liner probably ran into the water at a very high speed.
"The plane was solid when it fell into the sea.
It did not explode in the air, and the engines of the aircraft, when it touched the water, were exposed to large revolutions, as shown by all the turbine blades broken, "- explained the official.
The collapse of Lion Air liner has been the biggest aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people have been killed by the shipwreck of Garuda aircraft near Medan.
After the debris, the rescuers were driven away: the minor was also hit.
On Monday evening, on the road, the Turtles - Plungė, the cars BMW and Mercedes-Benz were faced with the Tilvikai.
The cars are faced with a kattomuša and three victims are reported.
It is reported that BMW's driver, born in 1999, went to the opposite side of the road and kattomuša crashed into a car called Mercedes-Benz, where his father, born in 1967, and her daughter, born in 2005.
The BMW driver was rescued from debris by firefighters - rescuers.
The girl from Mercedes-Benz's teeth are knocked out in an accident.
All the victims were taken to the hospital.
President: no artificial relief is needed for a referendum
Following the approval by the Seimas of the ruling proposal to reduce the referendum bar for the first section of the Constitution, the President will veto the amendments, and her adviser Mindaugas Lingė says.
"More than half of the population voted in favour of the Constitution, which is a requirement.
This and its amendment, in particular, of the articles contained in its first section, should certainly be no smaller majority.
It is easy to predict that the President would certainly veto, "said Dalia Grybauskaitė's advisor to internal politics on Tuesday to Radio Knowledge.
He emphasised that the first section of the Constitution defines the fundamental elements of the state: language, flag, territory, capital, sovereignty of the State, and that a reduction in the number of votes required to replace these articles would, according to Mrs Linge, create a "negative precedent 'and" open up uncontrolled risks'.
"In the opinion of the President, no artificial relief is needed, more preparation for the referendum itself, more dialogue with the people is needed," he assured.
The Seimas plans to vote on the amendment to the Referendum Law on Tuesday.
It provides for a decision to be taken on amendments to the first and fourteenth section of the Constitution with a higher level of protection if at least two fifths of the citizens with an electoral right so agree during the referendum.
At present, more than half of all citizens with a right to vote can replace the articles of the first and fourteenth sections of the Constitution by means of a referendum.
Elections have a right of around 2.5 million citizens in Lithuania: half would be 1.25 million voters, two fifths a million voters.
This proposal was born after the adoption by the Seimas in September of the Presidency's veto on the amendments previously adopted in Parliament, which have eased the requirements for the number of votes by changing Article 12 of Section 1 of the Constitution, which defines citizenship.
It is proposed to cut the bar for a referendum in the run-up to the referendum on dual citizenship, which should take place on 12 May next year and 26 May when the first and second rounds of the presidential elections are planned.
Since the restoration of independence on 11 March 1990, the emigrants are currently unable, with some exceptions, to have dual citizenship.
Double citizenship is sought by the Lithuanian community of the world, but fears that under the current conditions a referendum would not take place - a sufficient number of people would not come to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports "strakka," so they need to be updated
The infrastructure of Lithuanian airports and roads is beginning to run, so it must be updated, says Minister of Transport Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the renewal of Vilnius Airport is a minimum task that the State must carry out.
"The air transport infrastructure is already strained as it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We must renew Vilnius airport - it is not even part of long-distance planning, it is the minimum we must do, "- said Mr. Masiulis at the communication conference held by the Democratic Development Fund and the magazine" State "on Tuesday.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be crucial because important projects will have to be implemented - the construction of Via Baltica, Rail Baltica, Klaipėda external port, the renewal of Vilnius and Kaunas airports, or perhaps the construction of a new airport.
"The next decade will be very important - we need to complete the integration of roads, railways, the construction of an external port in Klaipeda, fix the airports, perhaps decide on the construction of a new airport.
We must not sleep, we must already start projects that will exploit our potential after 10, 20 or 30 years, "said the Minister of Transport.
Mr Masiulis has said that there has been too little money available for road maintenance in recent years.
"The state of the roads is not improving yet, as the funds are not being allocated enough.
We are guessing to build new roads, but even the minimum maintenance, such as the highway roads, is lacking in funds.
We must set an amount for road maintenance if we want to improve their condition, "said Mr Masiulis.
He stressed that Lithuanian transport services exports increased by 18.6% this year, and the largest export market became Germany, which overlooked Russia.
Mr Masiulis criticised once again the European Commission's proposal that carriers from EU countries will be obliged to return tugs to the country of registration periodically.
"We must make our exporters in Western Europe feel at home.
In my opinion, the proposal for a constant return to the house of tugs is absurd, as empty trucks would drive Europe, burning fuel and increasing emissions.
Most of this will come from the railways, because costs will increase to such an extent that part of the transport will go to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions, "Mr Masiulis said.
According to the Ministry of Transport, the transport sector accounts for 12,2%.
Gross domestic product (GDP) of Lithuania.
It employs more than 118.000 employees and has more than 7.500 companies.
Disputes with heritage protectors
Last week, Mr. Masiulis announced to the Economic Committee of the Seimas that he had started negotiations on the change of the cultural purpose of the Vilnius Airport building, which would allow the demolition of the old terminal and the construction of a new terminal.
However, Algimantas Degutis called the temporary head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD) the deliberations of Mr Masiulis under political pressure.
According to him, the building built in the 1950s is a value recorded in the register in 1993, and not a political one, and specialists have to decide on its removal.
Mr. Masiulis then commented that the modern arrival terminal would contribute to improving the image of Lithuania.
"The removal of that old terminal from the heritage would be a political step to demolish it and build a new modern arrival terminal, so that when you arrive in Vilnius you feel in a modern country and not as interesting, truly unrepresentative of our country as innovative," said Mr. Masiulis at the Seimas last week.
Mr Masiulis then also announced that it was planned to build a completely new passenger terminal in Kaunas and to connect the airport with the Rail Baltica track by building an underground station.
This transport node should be operational in 2026 after the construction of Rail Baltica.
Last year Vilnius Airport served approximately 3.7 million people, this year, 4.8 million passengers are expected and 5 million passengers are expected next year.
Last year Kaunas airport served a total of 1.2 million passengers.

Next year, direct flights to Madagascar will be launched from Vilnius
In the spring of next year, the largest passenger plane Boeing 767 flying on regular flights will land at Vilnius airport, which will fly from Lithuania directly to the island of Bė owned by Madagascar, based on information from the tour operator Itaka Lietuva writes the portal "madeinvillius.lt."
Blue Panorama airlines are declared to be able to choose between 259 economic class and 8 business class seats.
The new holiday course will be reached directly from Lithuania since April 2019.
Dominikas Milowskis, CEO of "Itaka Lietuva," states that tourists from Lithuania are trying to offer new holiday directions.
Madagascar is an island in the Indian Ocean, near the eastern coast of Africa.
New holiday travel routes for the summer season 2019 were also developed by other tour operators.
For example, Novaturas and Itaka will start flying directly from Vilnius to Tirana (Albania).
Minister of Finance about a possible crisis: it is important not to talk about the disease
"For more difficult times we must always prepare.
What I want to be pleased with is that for the third year in a row, we build up reserves for the first time in Lithuanian history.
But also a very important thing - not to talk about the disease, "said V. Šapoka on Monday in Brussels.
ELTA recalls that on Monday and Tuesday, the Minister of Finance and Vice-Minister Migle Tuskienė take part in the meetings of the Eurogroup and the EU Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) in Brussels.
The ECOFIN meeting discusses issues relating to the taxation of digital services.
This new tax is intended to avoid fragmentation of the EU single market, as some Member States have already introduced or intend to introduce a certain tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed that an agreement be reached on how the revenue generated for the provision of certain digital services in EU Member States should be taxed, as long as there is no consensus at global level.
The draft budgets of the euro area countries presented to the European Commission (EC) will be reviewed in the Eurogroup.
On 23 October the EC rejected the draft budget of Italy as not meeting the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time that the EC makes use of this possibility for it.
More information was requested from Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain.
The Eurogroup will also discuss issues of deepening economic and monetary union: the possibilities for implementing the European deposit insurance system and reforms of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports the stronger role of the ESM in financial support programmes, but it is considered that the functions of the ESM need to be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of functions between the ESM and other EU institutions.
Bali Burache.
Lithuanian labour traditions and customs
It was recently 120 years since the birth of a famous Lithuanian photographer and a culturalist, ethnographic and landscape explorer Balys Buracas (1897-1972) in Sidariai, Šiauliai State, the then Šiauliai Governor.
By commemorating the 100-year anniversary of the Lithuanian State, we have a great opportunity to remember how the life-filled national revival called many people of Lithuania, including the brothers Buracus - Bali, John, Bronius - from the village itself, all the creative powers to engage in the nurturing, routine and preservation of our cultural traditions.
Balys Burachas has, over more than 50 years, been travelling around his home country with a camera, presented a wide and realistic picture of the customs, traditions, folk art and material culture of our country.
He sought to preserve the rapidly dwindling beds of national culture and had a rare ability to comprehend the residual value of his work.
In the photographs of Balys Burachas, Lithuanian landscapes, mounds, our people in everyday and festive environments decorated the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines in national costumes.
This publication presents a significant part of Balys Burach's legacy for the description of national working practices and related traditions and, above all, their attractive iconography.
The published material shows not only the specificity and beauty of those traditions, but also the progress of our civilisation over the last century, despite the two world wars and the difficult occupation.
The book's manuscript is very rich in the works of interwar Žemaitija, especially the dome, the northern, the telškiai, and the inhabitants of Aukštaitija and Dzūkija, their celebrations and other traditions and customs, as well as the descriptions written by Balys Buracas.
More than 400 rare photos, mostly unpublished, have been selected from around 10,000 negatives stored in museums and archives, which are grouped according to selected texts.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture typical of dzukai, other districts of Aukštaitija and Žemaitija.

Tragic fate of the couple: dead after just a few hours of marriage
In the south-west of Texas, a couple of young men had died in a helicopter crash just a few hours earlier.
The 24-year-old William Troy Byler and his partner's wife Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler died on Sunday shortly after midnight the helicopter would get caught in the hill 16 km northwest of Jwaldi and 129 km west of San Antonio, said local peace judge Steven Kennedy.
It is strange that the disaster happened after about 24 kilometres of flight, just as many as the young people were years old.
Helicopter pilot 76 years old Gerald Douglas Lawrence also died.
The youngsters studied at the State University of Sam Houston in the city of Hantsville, Texas State.
They were married on Saturday evening at the Bylers family ranch near Juvaldi and flew out after the wedding with a family-owned helicopter.
The accident happened when the helicopter flew about 24 kilometers.
The youngsters flew to Sant Antonijus International Airport, where they intended to board the plane and fly the honeymoon, said S. Kennedy, who did not specify the final destination of the couple's journey.
"It is a very rocky, uneven terrain, and that hill is about 120-150 meters high," said S. Kennedy.
Mr Lawrence has been piloting this family for years.
According to Mr Kennedy, he was piloting helicopters and serving in Vietnam.
After the autopsy, the physical condition of the pilot should be demonstrated and could not have been the cause of the disaster.
The helicopter crashed about 5-10 minutes after the take-off.
His debris shone a wide radius on the rocky hill slope, and the hull remained "dangerously hacked," said the flight safety investigator Craig Hatch from the National Transport Security Board (NTSB) at the press conference on Monday.
The investigators are going to take out the debris and then look at them thoroughly, but the tug and truck will not be easy to reach the place, he spoke.
The cause of the disaster has not yet been identified and the preliminary NTSB report should be published after two weeks.
Israel's Prime Minister calls the entry into force of new sanctions against Iran a 'historic day'.
"Today is a historic day," said Mr Netanyahu to his party Likud's parliamentarians, informed his office.
"Today is the day when President Donald sets up particularly severe sanctions against Iran in the US against Mr Trampas, the most severe sanctions against Iran all the time when efforts to curb his aggression began," said the head of the Israeli Government.
Earlier on Monday, the Israeli Minister for Defence, Avigdor Lieberman, stated that the new sanctions would be a "decisive" blow to Israel's actions in the region.
The measures that Washington has called 'the most severe sanctions of all time' have been put into effect since the decision taken in May by Mr Trump and the controversial decision to withdraw from the world's power agreement with Tehran on his nuclear programme.
The sanctions aim to significantly reduce Iran's oil exports, which has already fallen by around a million barrels a day since May, and to cut Tehran off from international funding.
Israel has long opposed the agreement with Iran and says that its scope and terms are too limited.
The Jewish state also says that the lifting of sanctions has enabled Iran to finance groups of fighters and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's actions in neighbouring Syria and has promised not to allow it to establish itself there from a military point of view.
Other participants in the agreement with Iran - Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - are opposed to the US solution and are saying that the agreement has so far prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
The court once again surrounds the circumstances of the death of a young motorcyclist
The death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, the northern town, in an accident case will be heard by the court by the witness.
The Vilnius Regional Court decided on Tuesday that, in order to clarify all the relevant circumstances of the case, one of the witnesses will be heard at the next meeting on 26 November.
In the present case, the verdict has already been handed down, but the prosecutor's office does not agree with him.
On August 22, the Vilnius City District Court justified the driver of the car due to the death of the motorcyclist, who announced that the motorcyclist was driving in the city at a high speed and committed a serious infringement.
The Vilnius District Prosecutor's Office asks the District Court to annul the ruling of the District Court and claims that the accident is the main fault of E. Osipov and that the findings of the District Court are unfounded.
The family lawyer of the deceased motorcyclist also asks to annul the verdict.
The accident took place on August 11, 2015 at about 15: 00, when the vehicle "Skoda Fabia", driven by E. Osipov, came from Lakunai Street to Žirmūnai Street and encountered the main motorcycle on the road.
The Procurator accused the man that the car driver had violated the road traffic rules, which were intended to give the road, and caused a traffic accident - the man who was driving the main road on the Piaggo motorcycle died.
The initial police reports indicated that the motorcycle driver was killed, but later on after the investigations, it was found that the vehicle was equivalent to a motorcycle in terms of power.
Rolandas Bužinskas BNS, judge of Vilnius City District Court, said that the experts found that the motorcycle driver was driving at 89,2 km per hour, although the speed allowed at that place was 50 kilometres per hour.
"The car driver could not predict that the motorcycle would drive at such a high speed," the judge said.
At that time, the driver of a venerable car claimed to have driven at a speed of just 5-6 kilometers per hour.
The driver of the motorcycle, who saw the crash, tried to stop and fell off the vehicle before facing Skoda Fabia.
The Procurator believes that Mr Osipov, who was driving from the side to the main road, should have given way to the rider.
Novaya Gazeta: six Vagner mercenaries died in Syria
Among the dead are five Syrian troops and six persons belonging to the military company Vagner.
The source of Novaya Gazeta in Syria announces this.
According to the source, one of the 5th Syrian military corps units is deployed in that area, to which a number of Syrian volunteers and "mercenaries' are also attached.
Novaja Gazeta sent a request to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for information on Russian fate.
The former Belgian king will have to perform a paternity test
This decision is a partial victory for artist Delphine Boel.
She has been seeking to be recognised as a child of a former monarch since 2013.
A 50-year-old woman claims that her mother, Baroness Syblille de Selys Longchamps and Albert II, had a long love novel decades ago.
A 84-year-old ex-King denies fatherhood.
According to the station RTBF, he can approach the Supreme Court in opposition to DNA testing.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Boel, a former man of Delphine's mother, is neither biologically nor legally a father of an artist.
Delphine applied for the relevant investigation to be recognised as a daughter of a "real" father Albert.
VEC will distribute money to the parties, but the social workers will give nothing
This week, the High Electoral Commission (High Electoral Commission) intends to distribute a budget grant of almost EUR 3 million to the largest political parties.
This year, the Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDDP), led by Vice-President Gediminas Kirkkilas, was established in spring, so far it is not foreseen to provide funds from the budget.
However, they may be granted in the near future by a separate decision of the CoR if the legal environment governing the distribution of grants between the parties changes.
Laura Matjošaityte, President of the VEC, informed the CEC that "this Thursday a meeting of the commission is scheduled to take a decision on the budget for the half-yearly allocation of the grant to the parties'.
According to her, the decision on this point must be taken by the VKK before 15 November.
Seven parties, six of which are parliamentary parties, are expected to be allocated EUR 2,751 million.
The opposition union - Lithuanian Christian Democrats should receive more than EUR 0.66 million, the ruling Peasant and Green Union - about EUR 0.55 million, the opposition Social Democratic Party - about EUR 0.5 million, the opposition Liberal Movement - almost EUR 0.4 million, the Seimas Labour Party with no political group - about EUR 0.23 million, the recently-joined Party of Order and Justice - almost EUR 0.22 million, represented by Parliament, but neither the ruling nor the opposition-winning Polish election campaign-Christian family union - about EUR 0.18 million.
In accordance with the law currently in force, which will guide the VAC in allocating budget money, grants are awarded to parties that meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of the votes in the last elections of the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal regulation does not allow only LSDDP, which was established this spring, to expect money from the budget.
For this party has not yet taken part in any elections.
It is true that the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that the social workers receive at least a couple of hundreds of thousands of euros in the coming three elections - the self-government, the President and the European Parliament.
The respective amendments made by the Seimas to the laws of political parties and this year's budget were followed by President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The Seimas has not yet decided on this veto, but the governing representatives, Mr Kirkilas, and the peasant-green leader Ramūnas Karbauski, believe that the parliamentarians will seek to reject the opposition of the President.
However, this will not be the case until this Thursday's meeting of the CoR, so, according to Mrs Matjošaitytė, "grants will be allocated according to the legal order that has existed so far '.
It is true that the head of the VCC did not rule out the decision to grant an additional grant to individual political forces, including the LSDDP, if the Seimas rejects the President's veto this week or next week and the new amendment on the allocation of budget to the parties will enter into force.
"In making our decision, we will take into account the whole existing legal environment, as we are an executive body to implement the laws that we adopt," she said.
Should the Seimas be able to reject the veto and the new laws enter into force, the additional money will be distributed to the parties by the government, which will in addition borrow the corresponding amounts.
Grants already allocated to seven parties would not suffer from such a decision.

Poroshenko: The supporters of the murder of activist Handziuk must be punished
"I wish to state that no version - and more than 20 of them today - will be rejected.
Each will be inspected very carefully in accordance with the investigation procedures.
As President, I do not have the opportunity and do not have to obtain information that could undermine the course of the investigation.
However, the authorities must ensure transparency and the law enforcement authorities must work effectively.
Only in this way will it be possible to find out the truth and punish evil, "said Mr Poroshenko at a meeting with young people on Tuesday in Kiev.
He stressed that he was most interested in clarifying the murder of Mr Handziuk, and that the murderers, the organisers of the crime and the clients "take the necessary responsibility."
"After this case was retrained for murder (the case), they are quite rightly and justifiably threatened with life imprisonment," said the President of Ukraine.
He rightly called the public's request for an open and impartial investigation of the case.
Mr Poroshenko stressed that the statements made by the law enforcement authorities in Parliament should show that 'the government is determined to bring criminals and murderers to justice wherever they may be'.
He also said that political speculation on this subject would not help to clarify the situation, but would confuse everything even more.
"I call on all forces, both government and opposition forces, not to waste unjustified arguments and, God forbid, not to use this murder for public relations," said the President.
- On the contrary, we now need to unite and ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and transparent, fast - so that we can build public confidence.
There's just no other way for us. "
"No one will be allowed to take advantage of this situation to destabilise the country," he assured.
In July, Mr Handziuk, who fought against corruption, was attacked by acid in Cherson.
She was an adviser to the mayor of this southern Ukrainian city.
After the attack, the woman was hospitalized, but she died at the hospital on Sunday.
After the police and prosecutors failed to explain the perpetrators of this attack, on Tuesday, the Ukrainian Attorney General, Yuri Lucenka, presented a declaration of resignation.
After her death, the government officials received accusations from public activists that they were unable to carry out a proper investigation.
The activists also demanded the resignation of the Attorney General and the Minister for the Interior.
"I am presenting my resignation today," informed Mr Lucenka's Members by reading his study report.
Parliament still has to approve the resignation of the prosecutor.
Mr Lucenka accused activists of putting pressure on the investigation and leaking important information, which makes it difficult to identify the perpetrators of the assassination of Mr Handziuk.
Bill Gates introduced a water-free toilet.
By introducing a futuristic toilet, Bill Gates compared the transition from traditional such devices to a water supply with the computer revolution of the 1970s.
The founder of Microsoft Bill Gates presented a high-tech toilet in Beijing, which does not need water in plumbing pipes, reported Reuters.
The toilet works without water according to the principle of solid and liquid waste separation.
Both types of waste water are processed into chemical fertilisers.
"The technology you see here is the biggest achievement in sanitation in the last 200 years," - Bill Gatses quoted Bloomberg.
The technological toilet was created with the funds of the charity fund set up by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
Over seven years, the fund has spent 200 million dollars working on a plant that could convert human waste into fertilisers or water.
In total, in Bill Gates' words, about 20 toilet models were created.
The device is now complete and can be sold.
However, in order for such toilets to be produced mass, the Gates Foundation is ready to spend another 200 million.
According to the Gates' Fund, 500 000 children under five are dying every year because of bad sanitation conditions in the world.
The fight against poor sanitation, such as cholera and others, increases the spending on health, which already amounts to EUR 233 billion.
In order to better illustrate the sanitation situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates is to present a jar with faeces to the toilet.
According to him, this is a good reminder of the fact that in a small example "there may be 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200 thousand bacteria causing infectious diseases, 100 thousand eggs of worm parasites."

Anxiety in France: people's deaths are of concern
On Monday, the French health authorities announced that they had permanently banned the use of widely used pesticides, with concerns about several tens of people who have recently been poisoned in the west of the country.
The health agency ANSES announced that the decision to ban all pesticide-containing products was taken after a new safety inspection started earlier this year, at least three waves of poisoning in the Department of Art and Loire, which started in September.
As a result of these cases, the government has already stopped using the pesticide.
This soil disinfecting chemical should not come into contact with plants or farm workers.
In order to be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
In France, approximately 700 tonnes were used each year.
At least 70 people, including a large number of farm workers, in the Angers region, where there is a lot of salad salads, complained of eye and throat sores and breathing problems.
"These episodes confirm the correctness of our decision, but did not hasten it," the ANSES Deputy Director Francoise Weber said to Ouest France on Monday.
Metam - one of the most commonly used pesticides in the USA and Europe - is considered by the US Environment Agency (US EPA) to be a "likely human carcinogen '.
This pesticide, marketed under names such as Vapam and Sectagon, is authorised in Europe until 2022, when a new safety inspection is to be carried out.
"There was no other option but to remove it from the market, whether or not it has an alternative," said F. Weber to the aforementioned newspaper.
"We understand the difficulties that will arise for the producers of salad lettuce, for farmers in general, but public health is more important," she said.
Farmers have already expressed dissatisfaction with the government's decision last month to stop the use of metam in a region whose economy is heavily dependent on intensive agriculture.
In this region, more than half of the 35 000 tonnes of lettuce juice consumed annually in Europe are produced near Nantes.
The next season will be "much less salad, radish and leek," last month, after the government stopped using metam, the news agency AFP said Philippe Retiere, the leader of the Nantes Farming Federation.

President Paul Biya sworn in Cameroon after the election for the seventh term
During the ceremony supervised by President Davaye Yeguie Djibril, for 85 years, Mr Biya promised to protect the 'integrity and unity' of the West African State.
The oldest President of Africa, who has ruled his country for 35 years, has been declared a winner in the elections on 7 October, with 71% of the votes.
However, the elections were surrounded by low turnout, violence and suspected fraud.
On the eve of the Biya inauguration, 79 students and three school staff, including directors, were kidnapped at one presbyteran school in the Northwest region, where the English-speaking separatists are conducting an armed campaign for independence.
The majority of the 22 million inhabitants of Cameroon are French-speaking and the fifth is English-speaking.
In 2016, in the north-west and neighbouring South-West province, the demand for autonomy was introduced in the event of a dissatisfaction about alleged discrimination in the fields of education, judiciary and economics.
In 2017, after Mr Biya's refusal to be appeased, the radicals declared an independent state, the "Ambasonia Republic," and raised their weapons.
According to non-governmental organisations, at least 400 civilians and more than 175 security forces were killed this year during the separatist attacks and the government's retaliation operations.
More than 300 000 people have fled violence: some have fled through the border to Nigeria, but many have been forced to live in semi-starving forests.
During the October elections in the Northwest region, only 5% of the voters voted and 15% of the electorate in the south-west province.
In both parts of the country, Biya obtained two thirds of the votes.
Conservative primary elections: errors due to inexperience
"Some places were missing - understand that the party organised everything in its resources.
Some municipalities have allowed them to use their premises, but there were voting cabins everywhere, because we cannot buy them ourselves.
Thank you to those who lent, "said the politician.
According to him, complaints were received, but their content does not change substantially and the infringements themselves are not of a malignant nature.
"There were complaints.
Not all the people who took part in the elections were experienced, but they were also new.
Thus, not all the actions that have not been experienced have been in line with our procedures.
Therefore, we should have warned from the CRC that the principles we described were respected.
These complaints do not, however, give reason to doubt the results, "said A. Anušauskas.
According to the chairman of the CCB, there have been cases in which ballot papers were not stamped - the ballot papers found in the ballot boxes were cancelled without the stamp.
In some towns, there was a lack of space, but according to Anušauskas, complaints and violations relate to several tens of newsletters.
"Well, since the difference is several thousand, it certainly does not make a fundamental difference to the election results," explained A. Anušauskas.
It is claimed that the participation of the party's members in the elections was 55%, while the participation of non-party voters was 69%.
Both candidates had 400 observers and 600 people worked in commissions.
The results published on Sunday also remain unchanged - 79% of the voters voted for the winning Ingrid Šimonytė (16418 votes), while 21% voted for Vygaudas Ušackas (4441 votes).
On 17 November, the TS-LKD Council will officially support Mrs Šimonytė's candidacy in the country's presidential elections in May next year.
A short one says he probably won't meet Putin in Paris
National Security Adviser John Bolton of the White House said earlier that Mr Trump would meet Mr Putin in Paris, where the 100th anniversary commemorating the end of the First World War will take place this week.
However, by going to the last rallies before the US Congress mid-term elections, Mr Trump stated that journalists were not sure whether this would be a good opportunity to meet the Russian President.
"I'm not sure we'll meet in Paris.
Probably not, "noted the President of the United States.
However, the head of the White House added, they will meet at the G-20 Summit and "probably many times" afterwards.
D. Short still stands for "reboot" relations with Moscow, despite the suspicion that Russia was interfering in the 2016 US presidential election.
Kęstutis Strupas asks to withdraw the VTEK decision
Kęstutis Strupas, the former Director-General of Santaros Clinics of Vilnius University, is asking for the annulment of the decision of the High Commission on Service Ethics (VTEK), which acknowledged that transactions were not declared in good time and that the law was violated.
K. Strupo's complaint was examined by Vilnius Regional Administrative Court on Tuesday.
The decision will be published on 26 November.
The applicant requests the annulment of the decision of 23 May of the VTEK, the BNS informed the court representative Sigita Jacinevičienė Baltadujenė.
Mr Strupas believes that the gifts given to relatives should not be declared, he claims to have understood the exception to the law.
In May VTEK announced that K. Strupas, Director General of Santaros Clinics, and Silvija Strupienė, Head of the Department of Ambulatory Rehabilitation of the Republican Vilnius University Hospital, was then removed, violated the provisions of the law governing the declaration of private interests.
The investigation showed that four transactions were declared in breach of the deadlines: in 2010 a bank loan was taken with the spouse, the purchase of securities from the bank in 2017, the gift given to the daughter in 2017 - the apartment and the loan granted with the spouse to the individual and not recovered.
Mr Stružienė also declared these transactions by losing deadlines.
Persons who have infringed the law on the coordination of public and private interests in the public service cannot be encouraged for a year.
The law obliges you to declare not only your spouse's data, but also your spouse's data.
The study was carried out by VTEK on the basis of information provided by Info TV.
It was clarified whether K. Strupas and his spouse, Head of the Department of Ambulatory Rehabilitation of the Republican Vilnius University Hospital, S. Strupienė declared the transactions that she had made properly and in due time.
As Info TV announced, last year K. Strupas gave his daughter real estate with a value of EUR 125 000.
However, the former head of Santara clinics and his wife had not indicated these data in the declarations of interests.
According to law enforcement, the public purchase of computers and software in clinics was claimed by companies for illegal financial compensation, and it was disguised as support.
In this way, Mr Strupas is suspected to have discussed at least five times during the procurement of information technology in Santaros' clinics.
Mr Strup himself denies his guilt.
In September, Professor Strupas, suspected of corruption, was dismissed from the position of head of Santara clinics.
The decision of the members of Santara clinics of the Ministry of Health and Vilnius University to terminate the employment relationship with K. Strupai at his own request.
He was in charge of the hospital since 10 November 2013.
Professor Juozas Ristenskis continues to head the Santaros clinics temporarily until the competition for the new Director-General is held, he is promised to be announced this year.

In schools you already want to teach differently: promises less tests, more practice
Such changes in the content of education are planned by the Ministry of Education and Science, who presented them at the Forum "Development of content: foreign experience for decisions in Lithuania" held in Vilnius on Monday.
The Minister of Education and Science, Jurgita Petrauskienė, who spoke during the discussion, stated that over 30 million euros have been invested in the renovation of educational content over the last 10 years, but the results are not visible.
"According to the results of the International Student Achievement Survey PISA, students' achievements are below the OECD average," said Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė.
The report by the Ministry of Education and Science cites the OECD expert Philas Lambert (Phil Lambert) said that Lithuania is too focused on the provision of knowledge and not on the practical application of knowledge.
According to him, in Lithuania, general education programmes focus on the literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility of students, but they are also needed to develop children's creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy and empathy.
Deputy Minister of Education and Science Gražvydas Kazakevičius presented changes in the content of general education that the scope of the programmes to be updated will decrease during this school year and will be more specific and more disciplined to each other.
According to the Vice-Minister, students' education will be more individualised, schools will become more self-sufficient - they will be allowed to prepare 10 to 30% of their unique content of education, the current system of evaluation of students will change to a cumulative score, and the competence of the student will gain greater weight and will be acquired informally.
There will be fewer standardised tests.
Adding that general education programmes will be a bank of tasks for digital, user-friendly, linked to e-resources.
The aim of updating the content of education is to improve pupils' achievements in the international PISA study by at least 10%, to reduce the gap between pupils' achievements by one third, to acquire modern competences at school and to be written in different areas.
Lithuania plans to allocate EUR 7.8 million to the European Union and the state budget for the renovation of the content of the education since May 2018.
This appropriation is intended to cover expenditure on studies, meetings of experts, information and publications directly linked to the achievement of the objective of the programme or measures coming under this item, and any other expenditure on technical and administrative assistance not involving public authority tasks outsourced by the Commission under ad hoc service contracts.
At the beginning of October, the Ministry received criticism of the project of nearly EUR 8 million carried out by the Centre for Development of Education to update the initial, basic and secondary education framework programmes.
A total of EUR 7.8 million is planned for four years, and a first purchase of EUR 1.3 million was announced at the beginning of October in order to look for the producers of education programmes.
After the experts criticised the purchase, it was suspended, Minister of Education and Science, J.Petrauskienė, dismissed the Director of the Centre for Development of Education Giedrius Vaidis.

He was appointed General Attorney General on 12 May 2016 after lengthy attempts to remove his predecessor from this post, alleged by the highest level of officials and politicians to cover the corruption of Viktor Kokin.
Minister of Energy Ž. Vaičiūnas meets Orlen Lietuva
As Elta was informed by the energy minister's adviser Aurelija Vernickaitė, the meeting will talk about achieving the objectives of renewable energy in the transport sector by 2020 and beyond.
According to the European Commission's (EC) data, transport is the only sector currently below the cumulative EU-wide trajectory of the national renewable energy action plans, accounting for 6% of renewable energy in 2015.
The EC estimates that progress towards a binding 10% target in the transport sector is rather slow due to various difficulties, including relatively high costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and unclear regulation.
Renewable energy in this sector is mainly derived from biofuels (88%), and electricity plays a smaller role at this stage.
The Seimas took up the proposal to supplement the questions of corruption investigation by the Conservatives' appeals to the CT

A. Širinskienė in the project refers to "the possible representation of the interests of pension funds in the legislative process or by referring to the Constitutional Court or attempts to influence the decision-making processes of significant independent institutions such as the High Commission on Service Ethics."
The appeal to the Constitutional Court for pensions was initiated by opposition Conservatives.
The heads of the peasants found out that the Conservatives relied to a large extent on the arguments of the private pension fund lawyers in your appeal.
The leaders of the "peasants" are accusing Povilas Urbšis, a former collaborator, on the impact of the High Commission for Service Ethics (VTEK).
According to them, the former Chairman of the Seimas Committee on State and Municipal Government was able to order the VTEK members to dismiss the former head of the Preventing Division of the Commission, Mindaugas Nauris.
At the end of September, the Seimas formed a commission to explain the potentially illegal influence of stakeholders or their groups, the impact on electoral processes, coalition formation, the work of parliamentary groups, individual politicians, the activities and funding of parties and public movements, the legislative processes, the election of state-owned companies, public bodies managers, management or supervisory bodies, and the appointment of members.

Of the 12 members of the commission, seven are representatives of the "peasants."
Its members were also appointed two social workers, one "sustainable," a liberal and a representative of the Union of Christian families in the Lithuanian Poles Electoral Action.
Conservatives and social democrats refused to participate in the commission.
The new investigation was initiated by Ramūnas Karbauskis, Chairman of the Lithuanian State and Green Union.

The German internal intelligence manager has lost his post
The 55-year-old H.G. Maassen's version of the control was also instigated by stating that his problems were responsible for the 'radical left-wing' coalition of A. Merkel.
As a result, he was not transferred to another post, as promised earlier, but forced to go back.
Among other things, last weekend it became clear that Mr Maassen criticised the 'naive' immigration policy of Mrs Merkel at the meeting of representatives of European Internal Intelligence Organisations in Warsaw a few weeks ago.
The German Home Affairs Minister Horstas Seehofer, who defended the head of intelligence for a long time, stated at a press conference on Monday that the recent comments by Mr Maassen were unacceptable and "failed in person."
Mr Seehofer, who himself was under pressure from both this dispute and the poor appearance of his party in the local elections in Bavaria, asked President Franco-Walter Steinmer to release Mr Maassen to reserve.

Surprise girls destroy stereotypes about wedding dresses
A corpse girl with a white puffed bride dress - mission (no) possible?
Can a white bunk sailing towards the altar be larger than S or M and still look attractive?
Plus-sized reality show "The Evolution of Size (r)" will prove today that the beauty and elegance of bride does not depend on the kilograms of woman.
But that's not all - one of the girls in the project is going to have tears of happiness tonight - her boyfriend will show up at the filming site.
"There are also those who think that bigger girls don't get the attention or the eyes of the boys.
It's just a myth - my boyfriend himself is a sportsman, but he likes me as I am, he doesn't require a figure that meets some standards, "- the show participant Aurica will speak before the show with the wedding dress.
Wedding dress is not easy, in every sense, a garment - it is a complex construction, it has a lot of material, it is difficult to dress, it is uncomfortable to move.
Some women also think that a bigger girl in a white dress will look even bigger and therefore less confident of herself.
I can reassure you that a properly chosen dress model really solves this "problem," - explained one of the members of the show commission, fashion designer Robert Kalinkinas.
The fate of the girls in the project is dealt with by R. Kalinkinas together with the entire commission - Erika Vitulskienė, photographer and the social network star Naglis Bierancu and TV producer Laura Biršte.
"When deciding which girl has to say goodbye to the show, there are many squirrels between the members of the commission - we all represent different spheres and imagine the winner of the show differently.
The task of demonstrating wedding dresses has been made even more difficult and this - I can tell you now - that two newcomers have appeared, which were certainly not worse than old men.
It was a special evening in every sense, "- says R. Kalinkinas.
By the scandalous behavior of the novice - 23 years old, Ieva was famous for one summer reality show and by 31 years of outstanding beauty, the mother of two children Dovilė - like other girls participated in the selection of "Size (r) Evolution" and became part of the best twenty.
Unfortunately, after the first particularly open photo session of girls in the streets of Vilnius, they had to say goodbye to the project.
The girls were returned to the show by the audience of LNK, voting for their favorite people on the TV portal.
The event of international recognition is held in Lithuania for the second week of the event - here plus the size of the girls competing for the first in the country plus the name of the size star.
So far, there are only eight of them left - and they all know very well that the winner can only be one.
The exciting and unpredictable week of the reality show "Size (r) Evolution" starts this Monday evening at 20.30 at the LNK.
Actor I. Elba is elected the world's most sexy man
The U.S. magazine "People" has announced this year's most sexy man in the world.
It became a 46-year-old British actor, Idris Elba.
Although a man claims that this message was unexpected, telling us about the new title, he did not lack fun.
I thought, "You can't be!
Really? "
Then I looked in the mirror and thought - yes, I look sexy today - the actors were sharing joking.
To be frank, Idris stated that this title is a very pleasant feeling, which has glorified his ego.
The British star believes that he has often received abusive words and bullying, who made his childhood uneasy because, as he claims, he was "very tall and uncomfortable."
The young actor did not satisfy the peers and became the object of bullying because of his rare and unusual name and his African origin.
"As soon as I grew my moustache and my muscles became the hardest guy in my city district," - smiles at Idris.
When a man ceases to be proud of his screen, Elba works at discotheque parties in Spain, especially in the busiest Ibiza.
In leisure, the man enjoys a Thai boxing and has a depth of fashion, which is realized by creating his own line of clothes.
The British actor is convinced that the most important thing for him in the world is the family, so he is planning a wedding with the fiancée Sabrina Dhowre.
Elba became the 33 most sexually elected man in the world.
In 2017, the title was taken by Blackie Shelton.

Management no longer requires a distance of 20 km for the construction of waste incineration plants
Construction of Vilnius cogeneration plant near the Gariūnai market.
Management no longer aims to maintain a distance of 20 kilometres from settlements when building waste incineration plants.
The head of the Environmental Protection Committee "Peasant" Kęstutis Mažeika registered an amendment to the Waste Management Act at the Seimas on Monday, refusing such a requirement.
According to Mr. Mažeika, the 'peasant' group, which previously supported the 20 km distance clause, promises to support the amendment of its refusal.
Mr Mažeika's amendment foresees that from January 2019, waste incineration plants could be built with statutory environmental and public health protection requirements.
He acknowledges that the amendments were motivated by the President's doubts about such a ban.
"Taking into account the definition of the residence area, it is clear that a place where the above objects can be built would be almost impossible to discover," said the chairman of the committee.
In October, the majority of the government opposed the President's veto amendments to tighten up the construction of waste incineration plants.
In addition to the ban on the construction of waste incineration plants less than 20 km from settlements, the amendments provided for the government to decide on the future of the existing two plants in the public health interest.
These latter provisions are not proposed by Mr Mažeika to correct.
In Vilnius, the waste and biofuel-fired power plant is built by the energy group Lietuvos energija, and in Kaunas it is built together with Fortum Heat Lietuva, a Finnish energy group.
The latter is already burning waste in Klaipeda.
Talking about a possible compromise in the Brexit negotiations
The leaders of Great Britain and Ireland discussed the possible compromise on the difficult issue of Northern Ireland, which is breaking the Brexit negotiations, reported by Dublin on Monday.
On the phone, the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, proposed the possibility of reviewing the so-called hedging arrangement mechanism, which would allow for the maintenance of an open border between the province of Northern Ireland of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland which is part of the European Union.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkaras promised to consider this proposal, but rejected any possibility for Britain to withdraw unilaterally from this agreement, as stated in the report published by the Irish Government.
In his interview, Mr May "made it possible to review the hedging mechanism ', referred to therein.
"Varadkaras has made it clear that it is open to the revision of new proposals, provided that the outcome of such review is not linked to a unilateral decision to terminate the prohibition measures," the Government's report states.
Brexit negotiators do not find an acceptable solution to avoid checks at the UK-Ireland land border when Britain leaves the single market and the customs union in March next year.
Both parties agree on "insurmountable measures' which must keep the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open until a larger trade agreement has been signed to ensure that additional customs checks at the border are not carried out.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants them to be applied provisionally to the whole of the United Kingdom.
The Daily Telegraph announced on Monday that the Secretary of Brexit Dominico Raab wanted Britain to withdraw from the hedge agreement unilaterally in three months' time.
However, Mr Varadkaras told journalists in Dublin that his government 'cannot support this'.
"The hedging instruments of three months or a limited period of time are not worthy of the paper on which they will be written," he stated.
In the past, London and Brussels have not confirmed the information on the Brexit breakthrough in the negotiations after a weekend in Britain's report that the agreement is a hand-reaching agreement.
"I would say that we are continuing to make progress in the negotiations, but there is still work," stated Mr May's representative in London.
A representative of the European Commission, Margaritis Schin, also said to journalists: 'We are not there yet'.
Nobel Prize winners call for access to reliable information
On Monday, a group of outstanding thinkers, including Nobel Prize winners, made a declaration calling for the right of access to reliable information in the Internet era.
Among the 25 people who signed the International Declaration of Information and Democracy are economists Amartya Senas and Joseph Stiglitz, Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi (Shirin Ebadi), as well as Nobel Prize winner Mario Vargas Llosa (Marijus Vargas Liosa).
"We call on good will leaders on all continents to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debates through which citizens can make decisions on the basis of facts," said the group's report.
They argue that "a global space of information and communication" is a common good which "must be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and attitudes."
"People have a fundamental right to information which is freely collected, processed and disseminated in accordance with the truths of the commitment, the principles of pluralism of views and the rational methods of finding facts," added the authors of the declaration.
The document asks for help from world leaders, including US President Donald Trampas, who often criticise 'false news' but are regularly accused of distorting facts.
The world leaders should express their position on this issue when they meet at the Peace Forum in Paris on 11-13 November, called on the signatories.
This declaration was made in two months' time under the leadership of Mr Ebadi and Mr Christophe Deloire, head of the media freedom and media rights organization "Reporters Without Frontiers' (RSF) in Paris.
Among other signatories are Senegal's former president Abdou Diouf (Abdu Duff), Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao, and the politician Francis Fukushima (Francis Fukushima).
The Seimas confirmed higher fines for harmful products
The Seimas approved amendments to the Product Safety Act providing that fines for breaches of product safety must be increased.
The amendments were adopted unanimously in the Chamber.
As Antanas Vinkus, a member of the Seimas Committee on Health, said, when it comes to the new project, it is to be welcomed that the objectives set relate to better consumer protection for products.
In addition, its provisions shall be adapted to the requirements of the decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
"I believe that the proposed draft law is better and more specific for all operators involved in the supply and distribution process: manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As the practice shows, the current system of fines does not always prevent further infringements, as those who have paid the fines continue to commit repeated infringements, "said Mr Winkus.
The project was prepared by the Ministry of Economy, and after the approval of the Government, the Economic Committee of the Seimas supplemented it with its proposals.
The amendments to the law aim to increase penalties for infringements, to strengthen the protection of consumer rights, to empower market surveillance authorities and to establish a clear framework for monitoring the requirements and compliance with product safety.
According to the Ministry of Economy, there is currently no obligation for producers to label the product properly and thus ensure its traceability.
Moreover, according to the Ministry, the state control of product safety by the market surveillance authorities did not allow access to the territory of producers and suppliers, buildings, premises, inspections, which complicates the work of the authorities.
According to the Ministry, the six-month time limit for the imposition of fines and warnings is too short to establish the infringement, to investigate and to impose a fine.
Moreover, according to the Ministry, the fines imposed are not sufficiently effective.
Companies often repeatedly violate the requirements of the law - in 2017 alone 14 companies have done so.
The Ministry of Economy has proposed to impose an obligation on producers to appropriately label a product, thereby ensuring its traceability, in order to facilitate the clarification of suppliers of non-compliant products by market surveillance authorities.
It is also proposed to grant market surveillance authorities the right to have access to the territory, buildings, premises and inspections of operators who produce, market products.
The intention is to increase the amount of fines for breaches of the law.
A fine of EUR 150 to EUR 2 500 (now 144 to 1 448) would be imposed on the manufacturer, importer or authorised representative who has placed dangerous products on the market and the distributor who has reached the market, who has provided or provides dangerous services.
A fine of between EUR 1 000 and EUR 5 000 (now between EUR 868 and 4 344) would be imposed if the State Consumer Rights Protection Office (VTAT) or another market surveillance authority decided to prohibit the placing on the market and the placing on the market of dangerous products or the provision of dangerous services.
Failure to comply with the requirement to withdraw, recover and dispose of dangerous products would result in a fine of between EUR 2500 and EUR 6 500 (now between 1 448 and 5 792).
If dangerous products have caused damage to the health of the consumer, a fine of between EUR 2 500 and EUR 15 000 (now between 1 448 and 11584) would be imposed.
If dangerous products have caused consumer death, a fine of between EUR 6 500 and 25 000 (now between EUR 5 792 and 23 169) would be imposed.
According to the Ministry, a fine of up to EUR 25 000 is imposed in Poland and Austria for infringement of product safety legislation (no minimum fine), from EUR 26 to EUR 600 000 in Belgium, from EUR 155 to EUR 6 666 in Romania and from EUR 125 to EUR 7 500 in Bulgaria.

Norwegian Armed Battalion participated in NATO exercises in the outermost and north areas
The troops from the Norwegian Armed Forces participated in a series of complex exercises in the mountains located north of Oslo's capital.
It is part of the NATO exercises "Tripartite Connector 2018" - the biggest NATO exercises since the end of the Cold War.
Most of the troops from the second Norwegian military battalion spent a lot of time in the aftermath of the 11 September terrorist attacks away from home, in places such as Afghanistan - that is, in warm lands.
But most of all, they are skilled in fighting in the Arctic, and these skills are particularly helpful now that NATO is changing its focus.
In recent days, in the mountains located east of Tinsett, often in the outermost and northernmost areas, soldiers have been involved in instigated battles against real British soldiers.
The soldiers have the ability to survive this cold in the wild, but in the harsh climate they have much higher weight on their shoulders - one bag weighs about 50 kg.
The troops staying in the headquarters say that they share their skills to survive and fight under such conditions with other NATO troops.
According to the soldiers, this exercise, which, like no other one, is particularly reminiscent of real warfare, will teach them to be ready if there is a serious threat.

He also said he was not planning to take part in the forthcoming municipal elections.
Mačiulis had no opportunity to talk to V. Ušackas after he lost the original election of the Homeland Union - Lithuanian Christian Democratic Union Ingrid Šimonytė on Sunday.
"To be honest, we have not yet been able to discuss the results in detail with him and the team about future plans.
It is obvious that this stage of my life is over when Vygaudas withdrew from the further electoral struggle, "said Mr. Mačiulis.
He said he did not regret the decision to leave Kaunas policy on support to V. Ušackas, but regretted that "Lithuania has lost a unique opportunity to have a true leader in international relations."

There are workers in Kaunas Castle: what are they doing here?
After observing the workers in Kaunas Castle, the residents of Kaunas were hoping that the reconstruction work of the remaining tower was finally taking place.
Gabrielius Žiedėlis, the Director of Kaunas City Museum, assured that work on changing the protective roof cover of the south-west tower with a fragment of the defensive wall is taking place here.
According to the interlocutor, the rooftops will be cans.
"The worn-out tin coating was a threat to others - people could fall and hurt themselves - so it was necessary to change it.
The roof was no longer resistant to moisture, so it was also harmful to the heritage, "- explained the director of the museum.
Will these rooftops be like those that were a few centuries ago?
"All the works are combined with heritage and other institutions," G. Žaigėlis added, seeking to make the result as authentic as possible, but at the same time the important and practical side - the rooftops must protect the values from moisture.
Working with heritage has chosen a universal solution.
Before this, the tin elements of Kaunas castle were covered in the Soviet era, so they no longer had historical value, "the director of Kaunas City Museum explained.
The works contract was signed on 2 October.
The work is planned not to last more than three months after the signature of the contract.
"It is expected to be completed by the end of November," - the director of the museum taught his expectations.
According to him, the value of the works is almost EUR 24 000.
This amount, according to the interlocutor, was foreseen in this year's budget.
The works are carried out by "Statija" company in Kaunas Castle.
Kaunas Day has written, as according to the studies carried out, Kaunas castle could look earlier.

Eastern Europe Studies Centre will cooperate with two famous US "brain centers"
According to Linas Kojala, the head of the EESC, who is established in Vilnius and has already been counting the thirteenth year of operation, the integration of the USA will allow the projects to be implemented and will make the voice of Lithuania more heard on the other side of the Atlantic.
"We have been working in this direction for several months.
I am pleased that two large institutions see us as partners and look for opportunities for joint activities.
I have no doubt that niche activities will emerge, because the topics of NATO, security, disinformation, and the development of Eastern Partnership countries are also a priority for them, "Kojala said.
The agreements note that EESC and US institutions will work together to prepare international project applications, exchange of expertise and knowledge, and organise expert visits.
This should be particularly useful for Lithuanian analysts, because both partners have a great international reputation.
The FPRI has been operating since 1955 and brings together almost a hundred top-level analysts.
In the latest global rating of analytical centres by the University of Pennsylvania, FPRI took seventh place in its category.
At that time CEPA, whose analysts have been invited repeatedly to advise and work in the highest political institutions in the United States, goes to ten in the same category.
"This will provide more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to visit the US Information Area and encourage us to raise the quality bar up," Kojala added.
One of the first practical steps should be to assist partners in the distribution of the Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review, which will soon appear, as well as in public space.
The Eastern European Studies Centre operates on the basis of ongoing projects and is not supported by targeted grants.
The EESC's partners with joint initiatives include the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.
