A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policies with the need to fight election fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth by confirming that the US's electoral fraud is less rare than the number of people killed by the lightning.
The Republicans' lawyers have, by the way, recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voting.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the US democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the US states are responsible for the implementation of the elections in each country.
In this sense, since 2009, the majority of American governments have announced new laws that make the procedure for registration or order-making difficult.
This phenomenon has become more important after the November 2010 elections, where 675 new Republican representatives were recorded in 26 countries.
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced in 2011 alone, which restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 countries.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the time-limits for early voting, declare the right to register as a voter on the election day, and the right of citizens to vote for which there is a judicial act.
Before the 2006 elections, no US state asked the voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a claim.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana Act in 2008.
The Republican authorities were in a hurry to extend this practice to other countries.
Over the last two years, they have been promoting draft laws in 34 states, forcing voters to present a photo card.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, US citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible persons, do not have a photo card issued by a government authority of their state.
In addition, five million new voters do not have such a card in 2012.
However, there are often more than a hundred dollars to be paid to get the necessary ID.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affected by young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of Afro-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of people between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the necessary photo ID.
This is still enough.
The students who are considered to be voters who are increasingly voting for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo card issued by their institution in several countries.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who choose the Republican side more to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections.
Before 2004, no state requested a proof of citizenship for the election.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws calling on voters to prove their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Spanish votes.
Because it is obvious that two out of three Spanish voters prefer the democratic party.
In addition, in 2011, Republican legislators promoted laws in eight states that abolished the registration of voters on the election day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide help to those who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the electoral registration campaigns in the 2004 general elections have helped to register about 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the share of new voters' registration by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators in five other states have adopted laws aimed at shortening the period of early voting.
For example, in the general elections in Florida in 2008, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were Afro-Americans, although they account for only 13% of the state's voters.
The same applies to the Spanish population.
The latter represented only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, the white people who represented 76% of the voters were only 46% of those who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several draft laws were blocked by the vetos of democratic governors.
The US Attorney General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws that require the presentation of a photo card.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote.
The democratic critics denounce the party political nature of the laws adopted and see in them as a clear objective the influence of the results in the countries that are decisive for 2012.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that those states that have adopted these laws are 171 out of 270 votes required in the electoral board to win the presidency.
It is too early to be sure that these changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voting.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the US democratic system.
Prostate cancer early detection: should the test be made or not?
The PSA test, in fact, has sometimes misresults, with false negative or also false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater reluctance of the men who are already undecided to carry out early recognition tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We have received the opinion of two specialists.
In the studies carried out in the US, there were many problems between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and to make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that in the case of a follow-up after 12 years, the probability of the formation of metastases is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been performed.
I therefore recommend the test from 50 years of age or 40 years of age, if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk for men of African-American origin.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer has been detected.
There are types of cancer that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient must really be made aware of the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options in which prostate cancer can remain untreated if he does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases it is more likely to be an active monitoring of the disease.
Today, there is no treatment in many men who have been diagnosed with cancer because their cancer is not aggressive and is not a threat to their lives.
They are proposed to be actively monitored and are offered treatment in the event of disease progression.
With increasing accuracy, the criteria for a decision are determined, who should be treated and who should not.
That is why I recommend that the test be carried out.
But the most important thing is to talk to his doctor to determine whether he should be performed or not.
In cooperation with the International Society for Urology, Movember has developed an instrument to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, the adoption of a healthy way of life remains the best way to reduce the risk of being affected by it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancer could be prevented if all were to eat well and move sufficiently.
"If there were no more smokers, this value would increase to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian cancer society.
However, about 10% of cancer is expected to be caused by inheritance.
Several also remain completely unexplained.
The fight against tobacco dependence remains a priority for the Canadian cancer society, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It is a major damage to the health of people.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," the speaker André Beaulieu regrets.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the cigarette was abandoned, the risk of cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian cancer society, overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, intestinal, gastrointestinal, esophageal, pancreas and cervical cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity protects against cancer of the gut throughout life," he adds.
The diet
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too much, it increases the risk of having a flu or mast cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salt may lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamin
In recent years, several scientists have examined the relationship between vitamin additives and cancer.
However, their investigations are currently not conclusive.
After the Canadian cancer society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found the reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed more of an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stressed the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family's pre-exposure.
"The conduct of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs-Boson analyses
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs Boson has aroused some excitement last summer, and for good reason.
Indeed, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence has been predicted by the standard model - our best or "least wrong" explanation of nature and the behaviour of matter - but has not yet been observed empirically.
But for the physicists it is not completely certain that this is really the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle and that it is very similar to the Higgs Boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto, but there is still a lack of data to be absolutely sure about it.
However, let us assume that this is actually the Higgs, as it seems that there is only a small risk of being mistaken, and let us look at what is at stake.
There is an inevitable law in this world that does not allow two objects to be present at the same time in the same place.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and do not try too hard because you will hurt yourself.
Because even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that it is also governed by such a law: the Pauli rule of exclusion, which means that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same "quantum state," with this "state" as a whole consisting of some of their properties.
On the basis of this, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In a corner there are the good citizens, who are called Fermione, who are kind to the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the bosons, a bad gang of anarchists, who are not holy - certainly not this principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are divided into two groups according to the website The Particle Adventure from the Berkeley Laboratories (which is by the way absolutely amazing): the mesons that we will not treat here and the "power particles" by which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs-Boson would somehow be related.
But it must be stressed here that these bosons are not all as exotic creatures as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particle" that is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, if a particle accelerates with an electric charge or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" exactly at this place, in such a way as a pebble that was thrown into a pond.
This "interference" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosons "carrier of power."
Stable field
The same applies to the Higgs Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "disturbed" so that this Boson is shown.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, a little similar to a frozen pond whose surface could only be destroyed by a very large rock.
That is why a huge particle accelerator such as CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a size of 27 km! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
It is in fact not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others don't - for example, a sheet of paper would never keep on the fridge on its own.
And equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the others (like the photon) have no mass.
What can all these research be "good," Mrs Plamondon asks?
For science, they are used to review the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicists to examine closely all differences between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
There are, by the way, many physicists who hope that such deviations will be found, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and stop some holes of the model.
One must say that the latter still has great shortcomings, as it does not provide an explanation for gravity (up!) and dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the universe (up!).
However, such deviations have not been found in CERN so far.
Impact
The impact of these research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to believe that there is no.
By the way: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who developed the first permanent laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 - has already said that the laser was seen in the beginning as a "laboratory toy."
Imagine...
In addition, applications may also result from all the instruments that surround research.
For example, in 1969, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor today serves all digital cameras worldwide as the "eye" and has brought him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that you can really never know...
Palliative care - the best way to die...
With its Committee on Death in Dity, Quebec has recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life.
The debate must be resumed shortly, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to look more closely at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that ate him had given him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I made it seven years," he said half-hearted, lying in his bed in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for that," he says.
The disease is doing its job: an unmeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating itself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he agrees to have his dinner help.
He can even smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medicine, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to heal my diarrhea, as this is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man is peeing standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the home Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for certain people.
"This depends on the ability of the person to take a step back," he notes.
For in the opinion of several people working in the palliative care, major events take place in the midst of these steps.
The patients who are admitted to the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, the doctors and nurses who take care of them will no longer be overtaken with so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by suffocation."
But because of the disease, I really met my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I no longer have any wishes in life," she says, before she accepts that she has a mask to help her breathe.
She still expects a last visit to her son from Italy in the next few days.
In the home Victor-Gadbois you can offer with a group of volunteers personal care and help with the food intake.
The palliative care is used when there are no other possibilities.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec there is a bed for palliative care on 11.700 inhabitants.
That is very little, considering that one day we will all die.
This is where life is continued under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is given oral care with Brandy or Pepsi, as desired.
Diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died in the course of the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help family and patients alike," says Nathalie Savard.
There's no day like the other at the Victor-Gadbois home.
In addition to an old man of 93 years, who enjoys the last family meeting in the yard and is well supported by his pillows while he is in his honor, a young man of 36 years old, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two little children, dies in a tragic way after he has tried everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients less than 45 years of age," Dr. Christiane Martel is concerned.
53% of the patients enrolled in the home Victor-Gadbois come from their home, 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of the Canadians do not have access to palliative care, that is to say, to a care to relieve the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, at the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois and the company for domestic palliative care in the Montreal area, are more or less exclusively specialized in the care of cancer patients.
This is precisely the major inadequacy in the health care sector in Quebec, which makes it possible for several doctors specialized in palliative care to avoid the adoption of a law on the regulation of death aid and assisted suicide with concern.
Since October, a manifesto has been in circulation, signed by prominent people of the Palliative Care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in order to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not sufficiently powerful to ensure that all have the right to high-quality palliative care before you accept to go to death care.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was in the emergency room for 14 days with great pain without taking any measures to relieve her.
I fear that patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients in spite of the worst forecasts.
The survival chances of Hélène Richard were already minimal when she broke off a difficult chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop the treatment, she answered me that she was sorry to give up the fight, she told me.
But she told me I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the care staff that this wish has not been met after their pain has been reduced by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be made clear that palliative care is not omnipotent in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of the palliative care of the society of domestic palliative care of the Grand Montreal area, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
At the end of life, the doctors often use the terminal sedation, which leads to the patient falling asleep either sporadic or permanently until the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend that we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to use this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not reduced say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean "I want you to put me to sleep," but "I want my pain to be reduced."
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship of Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate scandals in Quebec
Road construction officials, construction companies, money providers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell each day what they know about a great "system" in which construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unions and mafioso are entangled.
A "industry" that was very expensive for the tax payer Quebec, especially in the 1990s and the 2000s.
"It is strange how the system has been falling apart since drastic measures were taken," says Jacques Duchesneau, Member of Quebec and former head of the Montreal police.
The scandal was revealed by him on the basis of an in-depth investigation into the defiance of the Quebec road construction contracts, which the then Prime Minister had only unwillingly agreed to.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010," he stressed, "the Ministry of Transport alone would have saved a billion dollars in the contracts," because some of them were trying to get their share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors," he adds, in the hope that it will "be able to show the tactics behind the individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, which was launched in 2011, is also making great efforts with its troops to the government's auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the police of the Marteau force, which has since 2009 led to the Montreal "sewerage cartel" being more restrained in the artificial inflation of the contracts...
In the last few weeks, she has carried out a series of house searches and made accusations of fraud and corruption against local government officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is the mayor of a suburb.
The next one on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of having repeatedly received bribes in exchange for public contracts.
By the way, it was explicitly charged with the construction of the Montreal Road Office, as well as with the business of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has aroused concern by explaining to the Commission the functioning of the 'public procurement system'.
For several years, he has paid 3% of the value of the Montreal contracts to a mediator associated with the Mafia, who transferred the money to the Union of Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr Zambito had his hand everywhere in the game by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to the provincial parties, especially the liberals who were then in power.
He also confessed to having organised an illegal funding for former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandy.
Sewerage contracts, the costs of which were artificially inflated by it
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes of $736,000 in return for sewerage contracts, the costs of which he artificially inflated.
Other road construction officials have admitted that they could be lubricated by artificially inflating the invoices with false additional services by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the Mayor's Party, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr Tremblay of deliberately looking beyond a shadow budget that filled his cash in black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, which led to a serious crisis in Montreal.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Montreal members to hit the alarm.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairie, in the east of the island, she was opposed to the sale of a municipal property in 2010 that was purchased for $5 million and sold for 1.6 million to construction companies in the booming real estate market.
70% Black money in the election campaigns
The investigation, which is ultimately carried out, says that it "draws on a thread that allows it to understand the functioning of the system under the control of ants in order to stop the evil and to denounce the guilty."
She says that the procedure is "painful but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but we need an investigation unit only for Montreal, as well as a surveillance to prevent the return of questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regular.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars," but above all, it is concerned about the role of the "leaders who are in the picture of tactics," if they were not involved in the fraud!
On the basis of a 70% share of black money in the financing of the election campaigns in Quebec, he said: "I was told that this was only a weak turn-off of reality."
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to parties to $100, which he says would not change the situation: "As long as the election campaign expenditure is not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
It recommends a complete review of the public procurement system and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by getting to the bottom of things with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr Duchesneau calls on those who laugh to take a look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season you have taken on a new scale with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
One can explain it through a personal insight, but also through the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
I make progress on her side every day.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my level of play every day.
And in a game, this is even easier.
It's going very fast in football.
But I don't break into enthusiasm.
Since my beginnings in the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine until my season at Saint-Etienne, I have always made progress gradually.
They thus take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new entrances of this summer are used to playing games of very high levels.
You also know that every training unit is crucial.
This means that a player like me has to offer the forehead and wants to do his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my game position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti is giving all the technicians respect.
There is currently no comparable person in the Ligue 1, and he is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with respected clubs.
He was in contact with big players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At that time, I was just recovering from a series of injuries.
The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation of my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took the place of the top rider.
But we're in ambush.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have qualified in this way for the eighth final.
What is the aim of the association in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have to say our words to very good European teams.
First of all, we want to be the first of our group before Porto, so that we can play the back of the eighth final as a home game.
Can the PSG become a major European association in the short term?
He's already got the budget for...
To become a major European association, Paris must win titles and make a long-term name.
This is not the case today.
In financial terms, the PSG is given the means to take concrete forms of this project.
Would it be a great failure not to win the title in Ligue 1, as was the case in the last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year we are really at the heart of this title.
The last season, we were close.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to carry the victory away.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have completed with 79 points.
Usually you should be a master with 79 points...
But another team, Montpellier's, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are running for the title, I think we have the stuff to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We accept this completely.
But if we win in a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something to blame us for, that is certainly a little frustrating.
You wonder what else people are waiting for.
We could never win with 4-0 every weekend.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game concept.
A team is building up over time.
In the Champions League, we have proved strength.
Look at Manchester City, a club that has not been able to qualify for the eighth final since two seasons, and which has also made huge spending!
With regard to the sums invested, you were believed to be a 15-point lead for the game break!
That would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good in the last season, were "booted" by this new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be the smiling winner and tell us that we have finally won it despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be fully dependent on the services of Zlatan Ibrahim himovic.
So much the better to talk about a "Zlatan dependence."
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots a lot of goals.
That's why he came and he proves he's the star of the Ligue 1.
Everywhere he played, he has shown that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he did is really extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the EM 2012 with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me from beating out some game time.
I saw things there that made me stronger.
Today I manage to make good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since I was baptized with the "Bleus."
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we have to show an exemplary behaviour.
What opinion do you have on the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the World Cup qualification group.
The national trainer is strict, close to the players and encourages victory.
As it was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualified us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Does the indecision imposed on 16 October in Spain (1: 1) represent a start-up game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has worked for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin you can pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and handling fees between the parties.
Moreover, as so often in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system, designed by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the bitcoin found by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but in dollars, euro, etc.) and a protocol for safe exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
Some thousand websites accept bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the rate of Bitcoin reached a maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, it fell to 2 dollars five months later before recovering today to around ten dollars (the rates are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive in comparison to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success," "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "similar to the traditional currencies."
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies, such as the "credits" that are used to advance in a video game that you can win or buy through games (and sometimes also exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is controlled and processed every time by a central authority.
With bitcoin all network nodes are simultaneously depositors of the accounting book, examiners, money issuers as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
The difference is that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of the data related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
With the content of the file it is also possible to ensure that the traded bitcoins are present in the public account accounting book spread throughout the network.
The crucial step is to enter this new transaction into this book.
This is done through a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, who has the privilege to add this additional line.
It is a scrubbing of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole thing is "chopped."
The aim is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check if it is the right one.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If one user wants to pay twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain without a link, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that has solved the task will receive 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this reward is halved regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are therefore limited to 21 million, but can be divided up to a hundred million, which leaves a certain margin...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with every improvement in the performance of the calculation.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The websites that provide services for bitcoin were attacked and the bitcoin deposits stolen.
"The vulnerability used does not concern the actual protocol," Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company for real money payment and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also shows these shortcomings.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind
They are accepted by others such as the WordPress blog platform.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analysed the accounting book and showed that almost 80% of the bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "mega-sale" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, who converts bitcoins to gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses bitcoin to validate the transactions that are thus cheaper.
The holder also manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by the dealers and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just have to specify an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are considered in favour of more horizontal-oriented systems.
"It will take some time for Bitcoin to prevail, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB, by the way, plans in its report to reassess the various risks considered to be high today in the event of a success of this currency.
We moved out of Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain its territory and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
We have punished the Afghan farmers in particular by seeing them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the wounded and the seedlings.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also of farmers who refuse to have an armed foreign presence, as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistan, Arabs, Uzbekistan and Tajiks have joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there if the Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I have seen from a hill planted with almond trees, which was financed through French loans, was done properly.
The trucks and tanks convoys overrun by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
As of the end of 2014, there will be no more Taliban inflow in Kabul.
Since its irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was overtaken by the war because of the struggles of the various insurgent groups.
Their power was then considered to be a kind of liberation and return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by the organization Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former Mujaheddin, the Afghan government and the current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important personalities of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into business makers by confiscating land from the government to sell it as a building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, thus taking advantage of the massive American award of subcontracts.
They were in disservice, and most of them were not involved in the fighting themselves.
As I heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, like those who could make use of the American funds: the capital flight is considerable.
The young people are tired of the war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world and enjoyed their benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to provide jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which are a modern world, is being looked at everywhere.
An army is now in place.
Are the authorities under whose command it will be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore the militias in the province that will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities should have benefited from a certain decentralisation of the example of the Western nations, but by abolishing the Prime Minister's office, which had existed since the 1964 Constitution, the US wanted to make it a centralised state with a strong presidential power.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, in particular on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional dusts are not available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative is left to priority.
In a country based on 30 years of war, a state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor has been spread that Afghanistan has immense resources.
This even strengthens the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground to get their hands on it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for an export over the mountains, no mining is possible.
The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, let the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) on the huge Buddhist site make their excavations and remain the most important employers of the province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French forces was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls and young gymnastics, Institute of French at the universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was set up in 2012, has carried out numerous non-profit work and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation to try to win the "hearts and minds" and to achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
This work, which required a large number of local workers, has helped to suppress the uprising: irrigation, well, drinking water, reafforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increasing agricultural land.
What kind of souvenir do we leave behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will help to improve local living conditions, which are often very hard in these valleys of more than 2000 metres.
The message received dozens of written requests from small agricultural projects from the municipalities of the province of Kapisa.
In order to free farmers from the uprising led by foreign groups, which is their own wish, the continuation of small, well-controlled and directly related civil aid would be necessary for their benefit.
A constitution with the breakbar in Egypt
It is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains divided more than ever with regard to the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives him the unlimited power of authority, he has decided to put everything on a map.
As a surprise to all, he announced on Wednesday that the constitutional assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state granted this House two additional months to complete its work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has been based on a provisional text, which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only led to an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delirium," by continuing to "break his word" and "to" kick the law with his feet. "
On the basis of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period, which forces the brothers to renounce their intention to explain the text section by section to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way of restoring his public and democratic legitimacy, while the protest is raging throughout the country.
After affirmation in an interview with the American weekly show Time, Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour.
In particular, as an ultimatum is put to the Egyptian people by this use of an overhasty vote: "Either you vote in favour of my draft or I maintain the unlimited power of authority," the latter should probably end after the adoption of the Constitution.
85 most of the Islamist members of this constitutional assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals have not complied with the call.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they turned their backs because they believe that they have not been able to make their views known.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
In order to achieve the decision-making capacity, 11 people, deputy members, were added in all haste yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were mostly adopted unanimously.
The commentators, by the way, found it entertaining that the only difference of opinion of the day... was expressed in the time for prayer, as some members of the board felt that the pendulum watch of the constitutional assembly was not going well.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Finally, Article 2, which drew all the attention to it, remains the same as that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of justice."
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules," which would have made it possible to apply more strictly.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is proof of their good will and respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
"hypocrisy" is the response of the liberals, who only consider this as a propaganda attack.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is carried out through other articles.
They are particularly concerned with Article 220, which gives the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with the laws of the Sharia.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people who are invited to an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
One can see in this the first signs of a theocracy. "
The concerns of the Liberals are also fed by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be much less moderate than the present one.
"At the moment, no concrete religious commitment can be seen.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been partly trained in the French system, "says Alexis Brouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
He admitted, however, that "there may be ambiguity in Article 220, since the terms used are derived from the religious vocabulary.
In particular, it refers to the "Fiqh" [Islamic case law, Anm. d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to decide on it. "
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticised by the far-reaching powers it gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers argue that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of dispute: the powers of the army.
In line with the military's wish, the examination of the defence budget is not submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
There will also be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations for the defence of human rights have called for.
The latter also share their concerns about the text which they consider to be a threat to freedom.
The case of blasphemy is being maintained and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no article refers to the protection of women, Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch points out.
In her opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel Ukrainian tourists expect sacred sites, the navel of the world and a sea of Sole
The Promised Land combines in itself the glory of biblical truths, modern comfort and untouched nature.
AIF calls you the five most important reasons for a visit to Israel.
Bend before the holy places
Visit the river Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who prayed in this river receive God's blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his wonders: the transformation of water into wine at a wedding party, the walking on the water, the silence of the sea tower and the fishing of fish.
Right here, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
However, most of the sanctuaries are found in Jerusalem.
Believers here commit the way of suffering or the way of the Cross of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins at the Roman fortress of Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the tomb church on the mountain of Golgotha, where the crucifixion, the anointing stone and the grave of Jesus are located.
Here, according to the Christian view, is the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem is at the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
In Jerusalem is also the most holy place of the Jews - the Klagemauer, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
As a tradition, people of different beliefs leave notes with wishes, which then go into fulfillment.
Make a trip to the height
The ruins of the fortress of Massada form the remains of the secret hiding place from enemies that had Herod of the Great built for his family in the year 25 AD.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountaineers can reach the ruins from their own power.
All the others bring an airway to this historic summit.
In the north of the country, between 1600 and 2040 meters high, is the famous ski resort Hermon, to which it attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there with a shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 km.
According to an old legend, pagan gods lived on the mountain summit.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
With only one trip, not all of them can be visited.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be allowed a visit.
One of these is the Israel Museum not far from the Knesset (Parliament).
There are old Qumran manuscripts or scriptures from the Dead Sea, found in rock caves in the Jewish desert, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
The collection of works by the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is published there.
In Akko you can visit the Museum in the Bad Al Basha, which houses several rooms of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the then visitors and bathers.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops.
The admission is free and donations are generally rejected.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells about one of the most shocking chapters of history.
The most striking department is the monument for the children, which was built to commemorate the 1.5 million children destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
There is complete darkness in entering the room.
The stars are sparing.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something for health
The three most important recreational areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, delfinariums and oceanariums.
It is amazing that the Red Sea is also bathing in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall below 21 ° C and the air is warming up to 23 ° C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and is bathed all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a location of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salt content and therefore even does not have a problem on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatment using saltwater (natural salt sole) and healing sludge as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and for the calming of strained nerves.
Touch the secrets of ancient life
These secrets contain the old town of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city, the famous sea road, which connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia, was connected.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to traditions, Noah built his ark right here, and Perseus saved here the beautiful Andromeda, with which he had a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to walk through the narrow streets named after signs.
Fortuna should be the legend after all who touch the walls in the alley with their sign.
In Jaffa you can find newly married couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo mines.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the crusaders.
In the Roman era, Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilatus.
In the carefully restored theatre, evening concerts and opera are performed today.
List for tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your poor English knowledge: about 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the journey is not to be taken in euros but in dollars that can easily be changed into shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you usually get on the bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a fast road and in Haifa the only metro line in the country with six stations that connects the lower town to the upper city.
In fact, it's an underground cable car.
A trip within the city costs 6 shekels, regardless of the means of transport, which includes a change for a journey of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is committed in Israel on Saturdays.
From Friday night to the sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport is resting.
And on Sunday morning, the working week begins.
In many cafés, restaurants and restaurants, only kosher food is served, excluding pork, marine products, fish without shed and food containing both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between various dishes with ham and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls of purebred beans and peas (falafel) and fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
For this, there are many well-nourished cats that walk through the streets in a cozy and uncleanness way.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the rooftops of parking cars.
The cats like lively places and don't say no to treats.
A car rental costs between 37 dollars a day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 dollars (Audi A6, Volvo S80) depending on the brand.
The insurance also costs $15 a day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels a day.
The average cost of tickets for museums is 30 shekels.
In figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of the adventurers and recreation seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Land, which is 51% higher than the comparison period in 2010, before the visa requirement was lifted on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While MEPs and citizens are discussing the benefits of the law on binding language tests for migrants, criminals are already dealing with fake certificates
Every year, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money for the maintenance of the families that remain in their home country.
On 1 December, a law came into force, according to which every migrant worker must take a test that certifies the knowledge of the Russian language.
To date, this scheme only applies to migrants who want to work in the services sector, in the local housing sector and in the retail sector.
However, according to the Federal Migration Authority, the tests are to become a duty for all the host workers in the future.
It is not only a question of language testing, but also of testing in Russian history and the basis of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated both for the maintenance and the extension of the work permit.
Exemptions shall apply only to citizens of countries in which Russian is the official language.
This law also excludes persons who have received their certificates and diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991.
The sense, problem and protection of rights
The whole of the audit bodies will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for Russian Language, the Russian University of International Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian Universities.
Migrants can take the tests in all cities; already more than 160 appropriate centres have been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
On the other hand, before the entry into force of the law in the press, citizens asked the following question several times: what does it actually do?
What changes does the rule of having to provide language skills for both the Russians and the host workers?
In particular, in response to speakers from the Migration Authority, it is about reducing the number of forced workers.
"Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says the Head of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebedev.
However, their rights must already be protected from their departure.
Only organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
There are problems with migrants without a job, education, language skills and medical examination.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant without a language knowledge will inevitably meet people with bad intentions who will put him in a dark, narrow barrack under the pretext of help, where he will stay with dozens of his same months without food and documents and will create 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have many complaints from our migrants.
"The one is promised to you in your home country, and on arrival you will be cheated, get their passports taken off and do not receive the promised wage," the head of the main labour migration administration of the Tajik Migration Authority, Tolib Schwaripov confirms.
Don't be shy, boss!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian Republics, who want to make their money in Russia, admit that they cannot only control the language of the country of destination, but can hardly express themselves in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: only a few Turkmen, Usbeken and Tadschiken can afford a reasonable primary education.
For in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school things.
As teenagers, these children immediately take the first opportunity to make money.
"It is difficult without language knowledge," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Citizens' rights stress the following important aspect of the law.
Only migrants with legal status must take the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most of the host workers continue to be illegal in Russia.
"Welcome" or "No access for unauthorised persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain an official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
The legalization also costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are largely falsified and we are not registered, and that will result in cases of blackmail.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tadschike Umed Hushkadamov says to journalists.
"Just don't waste any costs for false papers"
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be falsified.
Some fake certificates that certify the completion of the language test have already been confiscated by the Federal Migration Authority staff.
The fake papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get it for free: every migrant who hoped to save himself from the tests paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: it costs a migrant three thousand rubles.
The most important direct task is to protect the system from corruption so that the certificates cannot be easily purchased, both officials and citizens' rights are agreed.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise that they will have time for a basic language course to host workers who fall through the test the first time.
In addition, new entrants without language skills are offered places in areas where no active understanding with people is necessary.
Ministry of the Interior ignores illegal arms market
The share of legal weapons in crime is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is planning to tighten up the arms law for private arms owners.
The authorities are thus responding to the recent events: injured in the shooting of weddings and seven dead in the ammo of the Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradow.
The police want to ban the use of non-lethal weapons in the public and to raise the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported and promised by the President of the Duma Committee on Security and Corruption, Irina Jarowaja, that the amendments to the arms law will soon be submitted to the Duma.
Not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "raising the screws."
An open letter was published on the Internet, the author of which - representatives of various arms associations - calls on the authorities to refrain from "senseless tightening."
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, the criminal criminal, Vasilij Lesnikov, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the Ministry of the Interior's statistics, 142 crimes were committed with the application of the registered weapons over six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand offences were reported for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private arms owners will not prevent criminals from serving on the black market.
At the moment, according to the authors, every possible weapon can be found in Moscow for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons get to the black market via several channels.
There are five such main channels, a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts arms orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasian themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel there are illegal weapons that are stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons stolen from both the police arms chambers and directly from law enforcement staff.
Other weapons sold illegally come from military weapons camps.
Many military camps have often had explosions.
"There is evidence that some cases were arson to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military member.
According to Baranez, the arms manufacturers also contribute to the black market.
"Today, there are numerous private arms factories that do not stand up to international competition and, therefore, have the weapons under the control of the black market, for example in Moscow," the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many guns and guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is its own, sometimes craft production, as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggling," explains the former military member.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels in the supply of the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Government Administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, Critical Literature and publicly available data on weapons portals.
According to the investigators, most of the illegal weapons are from the army and the legal authorities.
Half of the arms in the black market were there because of the "guilt of those responsible for their work in arms," the report says.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons are from conflict areas, 14% are from theft in the production of weapons, and 5% are from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant of a arms store, who does not want to be named, assures that no one has been buying weapons found in the event of illegal excavations for a long time since they are obsolete.
According to him, it is more common for traders to get the supply in a weapons camp.
A gun, for example a type TT gun, is bought by an Ensign.
The gun is issued and passed through the fence.
"The dealer takes the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says
"The police, of course, know everything and, therefore, if they cannot comply with the crime detection plan, carry out periodic checks on traders offering illegal weapons," the sales consultant adds.
"As in the luxury shop"
Buyers and sellers are most likely to find each other through acquaintances.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone came to my attention and proposed to come to the station "Begowaja," where a person would wait for me to bring me to a certain place where we could negotiate the price.
The price of the gun I only found out there
Military Commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such a friend, but I don't trust him."
There are traders in the markets, but there you have to go and have a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who says that the daughter has lost a tooth."
At the moment, I even get a few strokes about a friend I trust.
He only gives me the strokes because he knows I don't give him up.
New people are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military member, Viktor Baranez, tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on this subject.
According to him, the Schemas have not changed.
He got a photo album in which "everything possible" was shown.
"I felt like a luxury store," the military member remembers.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I do not just buy, but drive the seller into the woods, and there we set up a target.
"I can shoot there, and if I'm convinced that the gun has a good shot, we'll negotiate," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results on websites and groups in "Vkontakte," where weapons are offered "for various purposes."
No papers are needed or there are personal meetings.
"You only need the appropriate amount of money," says the ad on the website "Buy a gun or a gun."
There users give up your orders and ask questions.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Of course without license," user asks "Ivan" (literally quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow," is the laconic question of "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service recently set up countless flagship websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons are going to go up to the network.
The people come like hungry fish when feeding and then land in Siberia and are allowed to shove coal
Military Commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is normally registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
Those responsible shall accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money through a bank machine.
"As an answer he receives a photo and a description of the hiding of the weapon," the press speaker of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow reports.
Viktor Baranez stresses that in the end you can also go out empty and get behind bars when you place an inquiry on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently set up countless flagship websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons are going to go up to the network.
"People come like hungry fish in feeding and then land in the Siberian labour camp and can shove coal," he says.
One Makarov for 100 US dollars
In the purchase of illegal firearms, experts are expected to have prices of $100 to $900.
According to Dmitrij Kislow of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a Makarov gun for $100 to $300.
You have to wait for up to one and a half months.
The weapon is issued in military weapons camps by midrange guards.
According to the Ministry of the Interior's official statistics, the number of offences of illegal weapons throughout Russia fell by 7% to 22.9 thousand in the period January to October 2011, while the number of cases of theft and extortion related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8%.
In the US, fast food and supermarket employees strike
Every fourth American youth is at some point behind the Mc Donald's cash register
Over the past few days, there have been massive protests across the US against low wages in Walmart's shops and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will continue to swell or whether they will soon be out of the air again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organisations.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests aim to set up trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy has hardly been organised in trade unions.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, on which sales were made in the US that attracted millions of customers, which sometimes led to hand-held quantities.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of which 2.2 million are worldwide, laid down their work and, together with trade unions and left-wing activists, spread the chain's branches, whose target group are people of low and medium income.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting guns and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart branches are on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many of the low-paid Walmart employees only buy at their own job.
The prices and the product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the USA.
According to critics, Walmart is often able to sell the goods in such a low price because the employees are badly paid.
The latter also complain about heavy working conditions, for example missing forklifts or hand scanners.
The participants in the protests on the "Black Friday" called for wage increases and expressed their concern that the contribution to the company's health insurance had increased from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee who makes $9.5 an hour couldn't afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the California University in Berkeley show that if the company increases the average wage to 12 dollars an hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
This is about 1.1% more than they are now donating for pay.
If Walmart were to completely kill the wage increases to the customers, every purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
This would be an increase of only 12.39 dollars per year for them compared to today.
Walmart's supporters are pleased to note that only nine states were protesting and that they did not give the company any losses.
The Black Friday lasted the next day in its shop from 8: 00 a.m. on Thursday to midnight, and during that period Walmart sold about 5000 articles per second.
In total, the Walmart-Kassen carried out almost 100 million transactions on "Black Friday."
The company's spokesperson, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the left-wing Huffington Post website that the work was "less than five" Walmart employees and the protest action was just "another PR trick" of the union, which organised the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart branches (which are not wanted in this advanced city and are therefore still inexistent), but McDonald's and other low-cost restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of portions, and yet you are not given sick days, and you are not paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
At present, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour in accordance with federal and New York legislation.
In fast food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually increased, but not too strong, and on average, their simple staff in New York get 8.90 US dollars an hour.
Less than she deserves no one in this expensive city.
I can't understand how it's possible to get in New York with so little money.
There was a time when almost a quarter of all American young people were behind the counter after school at McDonald's, but the young people still lived with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw in it the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, at interviews with McDonald's employees, people are constantly meeting me who complain that they have to get along with this pay and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Forum of the Wall Street Journal, whose author says it is irresponsible to have children if you don't know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests, which started on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. in the morning before McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashier and cooks of fast food restaurants receive a minimum wage of 15 US dollars an hour, which is more than double the current minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of trade unions in the fast-food sector.
The US law forbids the management of the company to stand in the way of this goal and to reject or release trade union members.
On the other hand, the management does not make it easy for them.
However, the creation of trade unions in the fast food sector is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high level of staff turnover.
Unsatisfied
There were also loud protests that day before many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a meeting at noon in front of McDonald's on Times Square, where some local democrats spoke, including city council member Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and yet you are not allowed to get sick days, and you are not paid for your honest work!"
The protesters were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, Mayor candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should support the fast-food staff together so that they can get a fair reward and achieve the economic prosperity that every New York man deserves!."
According to New York Times, this was the biggest action of its kind in the history of the American fast-food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on the ground, of which not all are employed in the fast-food sector in which tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet possible to see whether the spark of these protests will mobilize whole masses.
"The brain can only be overhauled moderately so far"
The subject of the extended reality, which is popular with supporters of modern technologies, is usually perceived by the lens of a special glasses.
First, in the summer, Google presented a working model at its annual conference, and in November it became known that Microsoft had also applied for a patent.
In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, it is clear that the glasses were only a transit station for the company's scientists.
It irritates the possibility of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating virtual open spaces.
- Please describe briefly which research your group is doing.
- We are concerned with the interaction of man and machine, but we want to extend the limits of this interaction.
So far, humanity has remained largely in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to look ahead for 5-10 years and anticipate the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a progress, and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in movement control.
- What else is waiting for us in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, much remains on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been crucial.
We are trying to change this, working on real three-dimensional representation systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We have to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
However, it is necessary that not only the user, but also its environment be recognized.
Then we could add to the real world much easier by virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
She's popular, but isn't she overrated?
- It is certainly not the universal solution, because it raises questions about privacy, because it is not always a matter of informing all the surrounding people about its actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but every one in their particular niche.
For example, in the field of the control of objects in public places, we worked on a project where we experimented with short and short, rather than with uninviting gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, the future belongs to mixed types of control, such as gestures and language.
- How?
- For example, we would ask you to give you this box of sprouds?
They say it and they point it at the same time.
- I usually just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to see.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can do at the time and what can't?
- Not necessarily, but this is about a mutual approach.
I think that in the next few years we will have to work mainly on developing new types of sensors, which will enable us to understand people's reactions more closely.
These can be laser sensors, for example, because they offer a good resolution in the depth, which is very important.
- What are your demands based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or anything else?
- The present generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main things are not the megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
In this way, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work.
Not only must the resolution be taken into account along the X and Y- but also along the Z-axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The movements of man are extremely dynamic and openly said, the present 30 fps are not enough for gestures in particular.
Stephen Betishes developed a contact sensor in our laboratory in Redmond with a adjustable processing delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors being closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not all understand how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work I needed just one device, only without contact control and with more pictures per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect is currently working with three "cameras," one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras might solve the problem...
Or increase the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice to have a flexible, kinect-like system where we could play with different camera options to see how this helps us to determine a position in three-dimensional terms.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft did not present its glasses to the public in contrast to Google.
Do you not think that, with regard to the application of the technology of advanced reality in everyday life, the glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to always keep a smartphone in the top of the hand on the way, but I think this is the most amazing variant, a "changing" extended reality, in which we could switch from the glasses to the smartphone via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and it has its strength (private can only see you), but also its weakness, because an extended reality with glasses prevents you from working with others on virtual objects.
Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also normal mortals.
There is a problem that often points to the critic of this idea: there is no sensitive reaction!
The hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures, I often speak of the fact that the extended reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of the tactical perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection document.
She's doing a great job with pressure!
But there are also technologies that are actually designed to give the "images in the air" something solid, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasonic rays at a certain point where the finger is located, a feeling that is still so weak at the moment, as if someone was puking over the handballs.
There are also tapes for the wrist that affect the nerves in the fingers, also that is a potential direction.
- Did you try to overlist the brain?
It makes you think it feels what it should feel when it just sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it that way.
Here is another task that we will have to fight with for a long time, namely to let a person who is physically in a closed room believe that he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in fitness studios), mobile platforms and large bullets.
So far, the brain is only moderately overrated, and before us there are many working years.
This is what makes the work in the field of virtual reality so attractive to a researcher: on many issues we are only at the beginning.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avantgarde," which is dedicated to city residents who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
On the excellent list, high-level representatives of the Petersburg art scene have already landed, whose success goes beyond the borders of the city and which often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, who is dressed in red, who is once found at the Russian Museum, at the summer garden, at scene meetings or on extermination.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are exhibited, they attract great crowds of people.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a shining personality of the St. Petersburg avant-garde at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and, by his presence on the street, he gives his fellow citizens a smile in the face and gives them a good mood.
Recently he caught a turning organ and became a Petersburg turning organ player because he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artistic existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I have chosen the color red as a fashion designer, who deals with the look and image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artist, artist and society.
In society, everything that deviates from the Graunorm is causing aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to talk.
When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At an exhibition at the Museum of Culture in Newsky, where my works were exhibited.
I understood that I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free but not officially recognized painters came to an end, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I was friends with the painters of the new generation, that is to say with the representatives of the "Gazonevshina," which was the result of "Pushkinskaya 10," and then it was the end.
It attracts me to the theatre, to the fashion, to the music, actually to everything, except literature.
And all this was united in your kind of clinic... and it was important to me to be at the centre of the Petersburg culture, where the best-creating artists should gather together.
In 1995 I occupied a room in the Pushkinskaya 10, and there until the renovation work there was a musical and artistic club for the Bohemian, the house of the Petersburg Bohemian.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how Schnur got there with his project "Ucho Van Goga."
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs to play-back, wore tight jersey, and one of them was the composer Igor Wdowin, who was also a member of the band today.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli."
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his big career, but he learned the basics from us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Gribodov" also have its origin in the Art Clinic.
That's where our employees and regular guests went.
I am a hero of the past century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000 there was a survey in the press about the award of "personalities of our city."
I won in the category "Artist of the Year," and so I had reached the peak.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a person of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the timeliness and sharpening of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition on "The Russian Museum as Clowns."
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and is afraid to be like this.
In a clown, all this wipes up and loses its tragedy.
I love the Groteske, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let us save the world by prescribing that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now everyone is looking at the clothes and is oriented to the outside and not to the inside of man.
But maybe you can't give a man your hand, but you should spit in his face.
The deception goes away by the dress-up.
We recently saw you in the role of the city-playing goalkeeper.
Who, if not me?
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Today, commercial art must be careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the disintegration of cultures.
The people used to form large groups: the Bohemia loved one and the simple people the other.
Now there are microcommunities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a $1-hundred note everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Now every cult star has about 100 followers.
- But several thousand are coming to the performances of Stas Mikhailov!
- The sexual-social sphere plays a role in this.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money, and everything is gone.
I have supporters, and the most important thing is not to cheat on them and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth I painted pictures that even hung in a series with the works of Falk and Larionov.
I started with pictures that usually only come at the end of the career.
There are often misunderstandings these days.
It is called: spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that is something completely different.
I am a person of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and rejected money to be able to paint.
This is the culture I support.
- Kirill, what's the matter with Petersburg?
- Good cult experts.
They say, "Servants of culture."
But not all of them can deal with culture.
It was different with the real Tsar, because the Tsar may not understand much about culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
There are currently good consultants in Moscow.
In Petersburg, we have some who might be experts, but they are being blocked, because they need more high-ranking experts who properly assess the former and make the way clear to them.
Now it's just your own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not have to accept all contemporary art and therefore some painters are looking for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the capital of culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding soil.
On our stones art is difficult to grow.
We need a cultural breeding ground, because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
There are many curious people in Europe who visit exhibitions or concerts.
With us, that's much less.
Art must be modern again, just like at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed by grants from the city of St. Petersburg
Birth in space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with strawberry inhabitants on board are looking for a replacement planet.
To save humanity, is the important question of how we can reproduce in the heavylessness or on the replacement planet?
I do not think there are many options.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"Mars and Venus," says the scientific assistant of the Astronomical Sternberg Institute of Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are relatively life-friendly, on the surface of Venus there is a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would only be possible at a high level or in the orbit of Venus, that is, in space.
The question of reproduction in space was first addressed by the researchers with regard to the flora.
Experiments with plants were already carried out half a century before.
The fourth generation of the peas grown in orbit did not differ in the least from the earthly species.
It followed the breeding of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in the orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to space to explore the effect of weightlessness on the development of embryos.
A normal chick is developing.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick must find a stop; it must be able to stand on its feet and start to move," explains the laboratory leader of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychev.
Without a solid ground, the chicks overtook themselves wild.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns were completely mute.
The chicks did not respond to light and loud.
Four days later, they just died.
"Twice we let chicks slip and then set it up because it is simply impossible to work with them there," Vladimir Sychev points out to the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last breeding cage with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" there will be only equal-sex species.
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized into space.
In principle, nothing special was found.
"This was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research must be continued," says Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the space rats were given offspring.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not been solved so far.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn from their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive drive.
Unlike animals, man could do that in principle.
The homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
For ethical considerations such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying to space for 50 years.
The greatest risk was in Tereschkowa.
The most valuable thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could have answered the following question: Is it going to survive the space flight?
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
"Finally, no one answered this question," says Space veteran Wachtang Watschnadze.
In June 1964, just a year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereschkowa, gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolayev, was also a Cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in orbit and even did work outside the space vehicle, bore a son.
There is still a risk.
We have very few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even in flights to the orbit," concludes Kosmonaut Waleri Poljakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
Yet humanity must look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory in the preparation centre of the Cosmonauts is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a floating state, the Cosmonauts win routine for work in open space.
The water represents the weightlessness.
Even if adults feel water as pleasant, it is a foreign environment; but infants feel water as a natural element.
It's like the little Ichtyander bear witness to the fact that life on the land came from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in the mother's belly for about 9 months in the fruit water and that it can then become more easily used to water.
In principle, this is logical because from birth until first swimming only 2 weeks pass.
"This is too little time to forget something," says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenova.
While for a newborn child the weightlessness is therefore a much more natural condition, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles are rapidly reformed and therefore the ability to push the child out is decreasing.
All right, let's do this through birth-leading tools.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to push the child out.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question of Waleri Poljakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the earth's education, the organism cannot train the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put in a stress suit in orbit like an adult for training.
He will simply miss what is of fundamental importance for his life.
"This experiment, which we are doing together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the creation of a disabled person, a completely inappropriate person," says the Head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in space is mere theory.
At some point, however, it becomes a reality when the strawberry people in their spaceships break up to a distant planet that will be home to their offspring born in space.
NKì-Chef: Control of the black system failed due to the debt of the policy
The Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws in the context of public contracts, but it is not in their application.
In the discussion for actuálně.cz, the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (Nejvyší controlní úřad, NKù), Miloslav Kala, says this.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and I do not think that is the case with us," says Kala.
A similar result seems to be achieved by joint control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative example of practice, he leads Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called "black system."
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now prohibited or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come to the chairman of the government, and the control office, whose duty is to control compliance with the law, is to obstruct its activities," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Chamber of Representatives' Control Committee, you discussed a joint Czech-German project, in which the laws of both countries on public contracts were compared.
What was that about?
This is a parallel examination that we started about two years ago.
To be simplified, it is about the European legislation defining how to handle public procurement, which is what national legislation is building on, and, finally, there is the actual practical application.
We have compared all this with each other, and although the examination has not yet been completed, we have found very interesting differences. In general, the laws are perhaps even more "strict and perfect," but the actual application in Germany is better in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to put in place new and more precise rules. It is also necessary to deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What is the result of this project?
Such joint control could help to stop us from constantly trying to perfect the laws and to reduce and eliminate thresholds if it appears that this does not have a particularly positive effect.
Economic efficiency means acquiring a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the reduction of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we will also achieve this objective.
It may even be that in this way we only burden the system with excessive "paperwork," and those who are looking for gaps in the system have it much easier to use the system than if the thresholds were higher.
They are talking about the problems of the practical implementation of the Czech Procurement Act.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is there a similar authority here to our NKτ, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the NKì is the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar to that of us and also has a college which is formed only slightly differently. However, in principle both authorities work similar.
The competences are also to a certain extent comparable, but Germany is a state, that is, that there are also these offices of account in the individual Länder of Germany - in which the German system is different from ours.
The BRH is only allowed to control federal funds, which is in line with our state resources.
Public funds, which are managed by the districts and municipalities, are subject to the control of the national accounts.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific information. Nevertheless, in some respects Germany is often referred to as an example, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better in all things.
Is that because the examiners are better there?
I certainly do not, but as I said, I do not like such comparisons very much.
To this end, it should be noted that those countries that are an example of us are also facing problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have any cooperation with our authority, would they?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, what was the importance of the revision of the procurement law for your authority, do you already feel any impact?
In view of the fact that this amendment is only in force for a short time, it has not yet been effective in our tests.
As our controls are carried out retrospectively, there is a certain delay to be expected here.
So far, we have had more impact in the preparatory phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control instrument "detection of risks of uneconomic activity" and with this almost 14,000 public procurement is being examined and analysed - the changes will of course have an impact here, as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of calls for tender have been modified, etc.
Do you see the adoption of this law more positive, or is the system being subject to further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption will be confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become "stricter" and can no longer be respected.
Under the previous rules, the persons subject to an examination are already accountable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) to ensure that any failure to comply with the contract law is equivalent to an infringement of budgetary discipline.
But does it make sense to make the law even more stringent?
I do not think that is the way it is.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system and not punish those who have committed a form error that does not affect the actual decision-making process.
Such a system only puts red tape under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out?
First of all, let us say which path is not the target.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not involve entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system now prohibited or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come to the chairman of the government, and the control office, whose duty is to control compliance with the law, is to obstruct its activities.
He can say, "We change the law and allow it," but he can't say that we act like nothing is.
The Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain transactions - and this is also true for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer is excluded only due to malpractice.
The law will never be complete, but it must be applied correctly - and that is what I think is missing from us.
On the streets there is a single ice-cream, but mainly dry.
On the streets of Czech Republic there are partly snow and ice-cream.
However, most of the roads are well accessible, and there is a need for increased caution.
Karlbad
In the district of Karlovy the streets were well accessible this morning, in the same place the snow and ice-cream were in place.
The temperatures fell to -5 to -10 ° C, during the day it should become a little warmer.
In the region it is no longer snowing, and in the lower altitudes only a thin snow ceiling remains.
However, there are about 30 cm of snow on the combs of the Erzgebirge.
According to the District Road Guard, there was limited visibility due to fog.
The R6 motorway and the first-class road routes in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention should be paid, for example, to bridges on which the railways are sometimes required and smooth.
All second and third-class roads, including the mountain roads, are also accessible.
On these roads, however, some of the required or out-of-the-way snow remains.
There is therefore an increase in attention, especially in the higher levels.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové districts
On some roads of eastern Bohemia there is a danger of ice-cream, in higher places and in the mountains, on the streets is sometimes still an advanced snow layer, the road and motorway management reports on its website.
The street championships warn drivers of ice-cream, which can occur especially in higher locations in the district of Pardubice.
The ice-cream can be found in the Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The roads I / 43 and I / 34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
The snow is particularly on the streets in the Giant Mountains and in the mountains Orlické hory.
An advanced snow layer is located in altitude on the streets of the Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov districts.
In eastern Bohemia, it is mostly sunny or lighter today, and it remains largely non-precipitation.
The temperatures are between -3 and + 1 ° C, a weak wind is blowing.
Pilsen District
The streets in the district of Pilsen are now well accessible, but local attention is required, and the way of driving is adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point.
As it has snowed before and the temperatures then fell, there can be ice-cream on the streets.
Local fog is also expected, but the vision will improve in the course of the day.
This information is provided by the district road masters.
The motorway D5 is practically fully accessible, but the road championships recommend increased attention between the 80th and the 131 km.
The first-class trams are mainly dry but frozen.
In the south of the districts of Pilsen and Tachov, however, ice-cream can come in part.
The second and third-class trains are moist, and therefore the reference to possible required sections is also valid here.
Drivers should be particularly careful on the less frequent roads in the area of Böhmerwald.
Olomouc District
Today, there are drivers on the road to the altitude in the Olomouc district.
After the use of scouting vehicles, snowmat remains on the Červenohorské sedlo pass and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
At night, the road championships were forced to use the snow, and in the district of Šumperk, according to the road administration, about 3 cm of snow fell.
In the other areas of the district, the railways are usually fully accessible.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
On the Červenohorské sedlo pass, the drivers have to expect snow in the direction of Jeseník, "said an employee of the road administration Šumperk today to the agency ČTK.
Her colleagues in the Jeseník district also had to go out at night, according to her information the streets are free and wet to the heights after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc district, the roads are fully accessible, but in the Šternberk district, the drivers have to drive carefully in forest sections, as the railways are still moist here.
Ústí nad Labem district, Liberec district
In Northern Bohemia, the street championships report a number of poorly accessible sections of the road.
In addition to several places with snow or ice-cream, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice is closed in the district of Ústí n.K. according to the traffic police.
The temperatures remain below zero even in lower places, so that snow and ice will keep on the streets. From the deep levels, especially south-east of the Bohemian Middle Mountains, no problems are reported, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic problems have been reported so far.
Ice glasses are reported in particular from the area of Štětí.
According to meteorists, there were ideal conditions for this at night - during the day rain and melting snow, in the night cloudless sky and frost.
The main routes and road I / 13 at the border of the Ústí n.L. and Liberec are reported to have bad conditions of transport.
The blocking of the road between Telnice and Knínice was necessary due to branches that were pressed from the snowload to the track.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think about that in less than a month of the world's downfall?
This is one of those disaster reports that we people so much like to start on.
With our band The Tap Tap we make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the world's downfall.
In December you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the world's downfall.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
This is a country-wide benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
For this we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, the end of which is forecast for December 21 at 11: 10 in the morning.
The day before, i.e. on December 20, three concerts will take place at the same time in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts is supposed to be in about the time that the Maya calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is in a 12-hour time zone in front of us.
Who did this idea come from?
Originally probably from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.
In doing so, we do not only want to collect enough positive energy to prevent the world from falling, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we give this world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key chains against the world's downfall, with which people can also support us through www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap has also recorded, together with other performers, the so-called hymn against the world's downfall with the title "World downfall falls out."
The hymn on YouTube is already very popular today. Will it also sound at the benefit concerts?
Of course, and at the very end, provided that everything works out and that the world's downfall does not take place...
The hymn is to be sung by all the performers at all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the hymns are transmitted live in a direct connection from Czech television.
The text of the hymn comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you get to work with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we realize many benefit events and concerts...
We are trying to get these people involved in our projects.
It has been shown that most are interested in working with us and have fun.
What is the purpose of the proceeds of the concerts against the world's downfall?
For the establishment of the barrier-free education centre Studeo, where we have been working for six years together with the association Tap at the Jedlička Institute.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly assisted by lecturers who help them in different leisure activities.
As the students themselves do not have the means to visit the readers, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a separate building will be created, in which we will then move in with this project.
At each concert there are several groups and performers.
What criteria did you choose it for?
We wanted to set up a program that addresses all generations including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý appear.
You can find out everything else on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "major events" planned for the future?
In May we perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we are preparing an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we would also like to play in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are in the USA, then I would like to do so with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not very small, so far you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips in a logistical and organisational way?
It's not as bad as it appears at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchair drivers, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage room. We also have to carry many instrument bags and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without any problems, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us that I have sometimes been surprised in part.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
With your travel abroad, you have a comparison of what is in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people, etc.
How did you experience these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, where everything works better than we do, we were just in Russia to witness that everything is still in its early stages in the East.
Moscow is absolutely not disabled in relation to Prague. There it is still unusual when someone is in the wheelchair alone in the city centre.
It is not even a matter of course that a wheelchair driver is to be left in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we're after...
However, it should be noted that an improvement in the situation will always depend on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common that people with serious disabilities can also move independently in public space, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
It is not very common, however, that a larger group of disabled people are actively involved in social activity there, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect in the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly strong personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we go back a few years, what motivated you to create a band in 1998?
At that time, I started as a maintainer at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something intense.
And since I am a musician myself and play saxofon, among other things, I have established a music AG together with a colleague.
Well, and over time, as our moderator, Láďa Angelovič, has used to say, something is out of control (laughs).
But the band was only known in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that the cooperation with well-known singers has helped us, and we have also started to actively promote ourselves.
We have become aware that if you do something and you can't see it to the outside, your own performance does not exist in some sense.
Thanks to the EU funding, we can also afford good readers, high-quality equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to make it this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I have felt the potential that things can be addressed differently.
In show business, one often copies the other today.
This is logical in its way, as everything new is considered with caution and only accepted after a long time.
There are only a few really unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression that the audience usually has is, of course, pity; this is only natural...
But this pity is absolutely unnecessary because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, if they have the means to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed, this is not only a progress for them, but for the whole of society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something right, you cannot compromise in many things and you must also demand some discipline.
This is, however, quite normal in my view.
Some of us come to us with romantic ideas, and when they find that they have two weeks of trial, that they have to do preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert trips, the enthusiasm of many will disappear quickly.
This is how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work and achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has twenty members.
How many of them have been there from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come and go.
Whoever has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome with us.
Takes place the day before the predicted world fall, Thursday 20 December 2012 at 21: 00
The venues are: Incheba Arena / Prague, Fléda / Brno and Plynojem / Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are finally connected by live circuit and it sounds a common interpretation of the hymn "The Tap Tap falls out" of the band.
The aim of the concert is to provide funds for the provision of a multi-functional disabled education centre to be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague.
The entrance costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years of age free of charge, tickets are available on pre-sale at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was included as the twenty-first member of this Space Authority at a Council of Ministers of the Member States of the European Space Agency ESA. Poland is the second member from the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a member of the ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
The path of Poland to space, of course, began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos were interested in space, with which they did not always have an understanding.
I would like to remind you, for example, of the presentation by A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 in the Warsaw Observatory, where the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Entrance to Cosmonautics."
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905) left the listeners cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch, which was founded by Robert Esault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important supporter of astronomy and space.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's worldwide recognised contribution to the development of space was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the earth-related side of the moon was named after him.
In 1925 a railway draisine was built in Poland, for which a rocket drive was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the design and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to start or brake the draisine.
The information is from the contemporary press only.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with missile-powered missiles.
The research was carried out by the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustav Mokrzyckiegi.
It is clear from the documents that have been delivered that research had been carried out up to the stage of practical testing.
The research was then, of course, interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, the design of a photo-electric hunting rocket from Ing. Rohoziński appeared in the technical press, and the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" was published by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocker.
Both projects were concerned with the military use of the missile drive.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of missile technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczazovy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The Committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of work its work was completed from the beginning of the war.
Other articles on space were published in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first mention of this society is given in 1954 in the November edition of the magazine Problem, in which four major articles of space are devoted.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to set up a space company.
At the time, there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was possible that the research of space would have a future.
In its early years in 1956, the Polish space company PTA tried to join the International Federation of Space, founded in 1951, and in fact, the PTA became a member in the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA president, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), was appointed Vice-President of the International Federation of Space.
He was in this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been a major participant in the development of the very successful meteorological missile (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first started on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did not weigh entirely 5 kg.
Later an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 the Błędów desert started flight tests with the two-stage RM-2 rocket.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another level of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe altitude winds.
In 1962, however, the further development was stopped.
The first RM-type missiles were the Meteor-1-missile developed from 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the start weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of this rocket were developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which were different in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor 1A rocket had a transport room with 0.4 litres of capacity, Meteor 1B over 0.34 litres and Meteor 1C over 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight height was 37 km for all three types.
In 1965-1968, the Meteor 2 missile was developed in the Aviation Institute, the first of which started flight tests in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a payload of 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 km.
After that, the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
The accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, followed by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites under the Intercosm programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Hermaszewski became second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimir Remek.
The abolition of the law on non-profit works is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court lifted the law on non-profit work.
This decision led to a lively debate in the public.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, full movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with rapid financial speculation.
The large differences in the value of work (wages) result in price increases.
This is a condition in which the manufacturer tries to maintain economic competition by importing favourable goods by "underlining" competition in order to bring about a greater market share and increase its profit.
On a large scale, this means, for most companies, that they move or buy their production abroad at a low cost, or that they abandon their business, and the result is high unemployment in countries with comparable labour costs.
As private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it causes, government expenditure is necessarily increasing.
This situation is further strengthened by the fact that the entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thus replace the overall social and economic damage they cause.
This situation is well known, so that there is no need for specific statistics at this point.
The relentless practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies where governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments deliver their own population to private capital without taking account of the social consequences.
This is reflected in particular in changes in existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force the people of their own population to accept the dictatorship of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
This is done on the one hand by economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment, on the other hand by the reduction of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as ever greater differences between the poor and the rich.
In Germany, for some years now, there have been public food outlets for poor people who are no longer able to feed by their own work.
The number of people involved is already in the millions.
As a result of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases where workers receive such a low wage that the state must increase their income to the minimum of existence.
Such a scandal was also discovered in the case of auxiliary workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all the EU's southern states will undoubtedly go to the same state where people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) under the pressure of a catastrophic fall in their social level, or to have a hunger wage on the edge of society, hoping that, at some point, private investment capital will be brought to the country.
This is, of course, a matter of where this capital comes from.
When it comes from another EU country, only poverty is moving from one country to another; or capital is going to be left out, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa at all, workers work for a fraction of European wages.
This concerns Latin America as a whole.
Liberal theories and media claim to be overcrowded that the state cannot take part in its own economy with capital, and that the planning economy leads to the economic disaster.
Private capital is very strong in its view that the state should not be allowed to intervene in the economy in a leading way.
But then one has to ask whether private capital does not affect or even guide the policy and thus the entire state in its own selfish sense.
Here's the clear answer: yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a practically omnipotent and all-state lobby.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual prejudice, legislation in which practically everything is criminal but nothing criminal.
In Germany, the situation is that a State Ministry of Finance is responsible for the development of draft laws in the absence of private finance, closely linked to industry.
These draft laws will then be adopted in the Bundestag.
All violence then no longer comes from the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that the liberal democracies are now rapidly entering a situation as they describe Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic in the times of Caesar and Pompeius': "The state has long been in decline and the offices have been occupied with violence.
Against the bribe, by unlegal scaling of benefits or with stone and sword.
Corruption grew uninhibited, and the people went to the election with already bought voices... "" People of character did not apply to offices, so that the state had no consul for eight months as a result of this decline... "" The people really started to talk about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation was a single rule, and that a strong man had to be elected... "Appian thought of Pompeius, but the strong man was then finally Caesar, who replaced democracy permanently by the single rule.
It is clear that today's society, as in ancient times, is based on the reckless preference of its own advantage, without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital is already, by its very nature, not able to recognise and enforce the advantage for the whole of society.
The result, as it was at the time, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, who are not in the least trying to achieve profound reforms.
We must therefore look for the cause of the emergence of fascism and communism in the relentless liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From the present state, the collapse of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain break, at which the next round is already taking place.
The fact that today's elites are in complete ignorance of the future losses of hundreds of thousands of human lives, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them from the older and newer history.
The abolition of the law on non-profit works is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under pressure from global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore due to the system.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms that increase state capital participation in the economy, increase citizens' influence on government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Labor of Chaos.
... "that nothing arises from violence, or could ever arise," Sting sings in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the Refrain:... "so that we don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons did not want war, there would be no," says the dying Gutele Schnapper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, there was a number of reactions.
Some are behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defence while calling the Palestinians terrorists; others in turn support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed by the Palestinian Arabs and call the state of Israel a terrorist.
I do not want to write at this point about who is guilty and victims in these ever-recurring waves of killing; at the end of the day, the people of Israel, including the self-government, were born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence itself.
I am about to open to readers the view behind the scenes, the look at whom the 95 years of tension (from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small spot of land in the Middle East are particularly useful.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and come out of my own understanding of who or which group of people has a significant influence on the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can make a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether it was really always those personalities who determined their steps autonomously, or whether there was someone behind their throne who led their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of less individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power has not emerged within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families there is a particularly strong one, which could be called the head of the crack (I don't know if anyone else stands above them, but I do not rule out this) - the Rothschild.
Not much is written about them.
I understand.
The first press agency (Reuters) was already bought by the Rothschilds in the 1990s in order to prevent the connection of their name with highly criminal acts, in the context of which there was always the consolidation of their power, the multiplication of their assets or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks they are in war or are preparing for them (before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5 countries, after the fall of Ghaddafis there were only four, with Russia under its central bank in the meantime under the Russian government).
Whoever tried to face this family had to pay for it with life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as central bank, began to issue his own (state) banknotes during the Civil War, and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered in 1963; Mr Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he tried to sue the FED for the release of the world economic crisis in 1929.
The global power of the Rothschilds led in the years 1859-1871 to the formulation of a plan for the unleashing of three world wars by Albert Pik, a freemason of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchist states of Europe, the second war should in particular break the colonial rule of Britain, and the third war should reduce the world's population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would ensure their amenities and their luxury and would not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than the advance) and ultimately lead to the adoption of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families works with the Rothschilds is the triggering of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order from chaao - order from chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the FED, so that crises such as those that were triggered by them in 1907 do not repeat themselves).
After the murder of the Habsburg Throne-Folker Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they succeeded in triggering the First World War, they destroyed the Russian Empire of Tsar by the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian Empire of Tsar), then the central European great power of Austria-Hungary was dissolved.
In order to be able to make the Second World War easier, the bankers had a latent situation of conflict through politics, by making Germany work with huge war repairs, creating the condition of poor masses, so that they had to subjugate the Germans only a sufficiently strong leader, who called the guilty and offered simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-ethnic state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which should take the role of a fifth column and also took in order to unleash the war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschild initiated the foundation of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, as far as possible in the historical area of Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration already mentioned created the condition for the mass immigration of Jews into Palestine; there were first clashes with the resident Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler was getting rid of the chain on which the international bankers had initially held him, or whether everything was going according to plan, is difficult to estimate, in any case the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the condition for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and as was prepared for the Second World War by the war repairs against Germany, the exclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will become victims in the front line of the war, along with the Arab and Muslim people of the Middle East, as in World War II.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of conflict and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just thinking about how sharp people are to be divided into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the guilty, and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where wrong only causes injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with the greed of individuals and their quest for global power at the beginning?
It is necessary to distinguish between the people of Israel and their leaders, but the international bankers in Israel, as well as the people, are only voting for their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal to the international bankers, who is doing everything possible to unleash a war with Iran, which, in view of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Organisation of Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could rapidly become a global conflict, and which, due to Iran's control over the only 2-mile-wide road of Hormus, which is about 20% of the world's oil supply, could be destroyed by the global economy.
In what light are the words of David Rockefellers from 1994: "The only thing we need is an all-embracing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In its idea, the new world order is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth a chip to subdue this being to total control.
"And it makes that the little ones and the great ones, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants all give themselves a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, that no one can buy or sell, but he has the sign, the name of the animal or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom, and he who has understanding, consider the number of the beast.
For it is a man's number, and his number is six hundred and sixty. "
The movie Argo: When it's the worst to call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrators of Islamic students occupied the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For their release, they called for the delivery of the fallen sheep Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who for decades had maintained the patronage of his regime.
There was no positive way out of this situation for the American government - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have severely damaged the confidence of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was unable to enforce the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a heavy blow to the call of the united states, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt to release the hostages made everything worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been carried out by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages at home created a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story, which gave the US a small victory.
Immediately before the occupation of the message, six embassy staff managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees from Iran, helping them to cover up their true identity - they were travelling with Canadian passports as members of a film staff who allegedly visited the country of Drehorte for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by the expert for "Exfiltration," Tony Mendez, also required the cooperation of Hollywood.
To make the cover credible, articles about this film project appeared in specialist journals, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time, and the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic political thriller, but also a so-called "Caper Movie," i.e. the story of a successful piece of Husaar, such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This changes the levels of mood in the film - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and also in the film version of the same situations there are no big differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which come ironic and slightly overshadowed.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the office halls, on the phone...
With this film, Ben Affleck has succeeded in a remarkable relaunch of his career.
From a smiled actor has become a respectable director, and also as an actor he is no longer the goal of ironic comments.
Argo is his third film after the Crimean No Children's Game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller City without grace (2010).
At the same time it is Affleck's first film, which does not play in the director's home Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the features that the previous films of this director removed from the standard Hollywood.
But Affleck also proves this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the initial sequence of the first aeration of the message is very impressive in its clarity, yet still conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when history moves somewhere.
A similar effect is achieved with his team in fictional scenes (the wrong film staff on a basar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not really offer many exciting scenes in the film sense.
But he works quite successfully with the few, sometimes helping the reality - which does not always look so elegant (the scenes in which the threatening crisis at the airport in Tehran is turned off from a phone call in America, or the chase on the runway, have a little effect).
The weakness of Argo is its too wide spread, which is due to the need to have to show too much in action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their figures would have earned more space, and so they are far from alone in the film.
Affleck's film thus loses some of its tensile strength. It is a film that can be followed with a certain interest and which can be considered to be the design and the retro-style that is reminiscent of a thriller from the 70th years.
However, he is very difficult to gain enthusiasm.
However, as a reminder of a piece of history that has been living in a certain way today, and as a proof of how overstretched the ideas are of the omnipotent and all-knowing intelligence services, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for inflating balloons, bananas and the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which publishes an annual survey on the most absurd bank charges, decided this year to organise the competition "Absurdeste Verordnung / Idea from the EU workshop."
"This was the idea that the recently presented EU plan to introduce a 40% women's rate in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who is working on the organisation of this survey, to the Právo newspaper.
For example, the European Court of Justice's judgment on the harmonisation of insurance tariffs for men and women is among the identified absurdities.
Until then, women had an advantage in life insurance because they were objectively less at risk for insurance companies.
"Further incredible insights from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will take place until the end of February 2013, "Nacher informed.
The controversial EU regulations include, among other things, the binding incorporation of bioethanol into fuels which, as a result, are natural, and the ban on reliable mercury thermometer, only because they contain a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or also the directive on the size of chicken cages, which made eggs much more expensive this year.
In the past, criticism has also harvested the actual ban on the use of the term "butter scam" or the ban on the sale of traditional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose claims are usually represented in Brussels by one or more Member States (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks with a veto threat).
Lobby interests also found that bananas of the highest trading class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have "curvature anomaly."
The European Commission defended itself in the argument that it would only harmonise the ununiform national standards that would hinder trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables have already been softened by the EU against the resistance of some countries to the fact that the previous directives would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey may be the last year's EU regulation, which, according to balloons, must be provided with an indication that children under eight years of age are not allowed to blow up the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU was referring to an American study, which, according to balloons, is the leading cause of child suffocation.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age in the use of annual market flows.
Curiosities also exist at home
A directive, which concerns European officials themselves, is also relatively absurd - anyone who has an official role in the EU must not use the name of Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue to Greece and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Fair, also nominated the EU Regulation on the scope of food stocks in the territory of a Member State, in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities.
The EU thus established the maximum volume of food stocks that could be in the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic, for example, exceeded the fixed volume of preserved mushrooms, which threatened us to have a high fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or the idea of providing funding for applications for funding.
These ideas did not come from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we have no sea.
We will apply to the EU for reimbursement, "said then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in the autumn of 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the cereals harvest had been very high and that the state camps were overfilled as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
As the Czech Republic has a further way to sea ports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros, according to Palas.
The European Commission finally met the Czech Republic so far that it organised a call for tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The Ministry of Regional Development, under the direction of Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), offered the municipalities funding for applications for funding, which should in particular be funds for the preparation of funding applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
However, in the Member States, regulations are easily becoming the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also to ensure the effectiveness and development of the whole European Union, in the opinion of some experts, deserve more recognition.
In the opinion of these experts, a more serious problem is the EU funding for projects which have nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but which have been forced to do so in the budgetary negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions also point to the fact that the Czech Republic, like other Member States in Brussels, must fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and not always win this fight.
The Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky" after a six-year fight with Germany and Austria, the national (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, but our manufacturers had to be renamed "Tuzemák."
The term rum may only be used for products from sugar cane distillate, not for products from sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of the world-famous cheeses Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübeck Marzipans or the Parmachinken now also shows up the Karlbaden Zunback, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or the Saazer hops.
With an EU brand, the Pardubicer gingerbread or the Hořicer rolls can be brushed.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how do you get the idea of running for President's office?
It's not about being a senator or a president.
If everything in our country worked without any problems, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the Republic has been looted for 20 years, how thieves walk around freely, while people are raising taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition of becoming a politician.
But if I see something that I do not like, I try to propose a solution to change this.
And since I'm already over 40, and I'm independent and unpartisan, I have no other way of influencing things than running for the office of a senator or the president.
In the Senate you made it and then made your way to the castle.
Is that not how you turn your back on your voters?
I've been telling myself all along that I'm going to start the fight for the castle after the Senate elections.
Later I specified this and said that I will be running for President's office, provided I am elected Senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
I need as much influence and as much a mandate as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we, as a people in the pub and in front of the TV, are boasting, but we are putting down everyone who wants to change something.
In addition, the media that want to take the honor from you, and who confuse the freedom of the word with the freedom to lie.
For example, I was told that I would bribe journalists or that I was a consultant to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
The fight for the castle you have taken up with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive statements of assets over 20 million crowns.
You have to change laws to do that.
As President, you have no powers in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can bring forward legislative proposals.
How are you going to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have been working to ensure that the travel guide remains a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is small-scale policy - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent partisan, I have a much greater potential to gain support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take from every party what is best for our country without the idea of a drawer and a party dogma.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics rather right or left?
From a Czech point of view, people seem to see me on the left.
But for me, this right-left thinking is completely irrelevant.
It's important to me that we move on.
It is not a question of whether anyone belongs to the left or to the right; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support every good approach, even if it comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You don't like when someone calls you Populists.
But don't you confirm what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to approach this one.
It can be called populism for me, but all the proposals I have been talking about are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament, you will only have words.
And that way, you won't get far in the long term in politics.
Or do you think that if you talk to people long enough, you will succeed, for example, in enforcing material and criminal liability?
I have no other way.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to bring them to our side in order to achieve these objectives.
As President, it would not be a problem for me to call on the leaders of the parliamentary parties live on television to establish the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors in law.
And the people who have spoken would have to say why they refuse to do so.
A strong personality that points to maladministration can exert pressure on the political scene.
Just take the direct election of the President, which was a merit of public pressure.
I say clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started with the policy and try to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn't work, I go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a little like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I do not achieve anything on my own; therefore I have talked to several well-known personalities about whether they do not want to apply for the Senate as well.
For example, I spoke to Radim Jančura, who, however, refused to do so because of the overload of work.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorenzo, who uncovered the fraud in the trade in light fuel oil.
I started my candidacy with the condition that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I'm not sure.
Sixty percent of the voters have not gone to the elections at all, and those who have gone have mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independent.
People have chosen such a senate composition that changes will be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, for example for the direct election of the mayors and district leaders.
Are you thinking about setting up a party of your own?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to review the past of any potential party member, and I don't even have the money for it.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign; in my transparent account, there are only CZK 20,000.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about a statement of assets, how do you look?
I estimate my private assets to be about CZK 60 million.
In Prague I have a property with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu superb, which is worth about a million, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, the Aston Martin was a child's dream - James Bond always liked me as he was driving in the car, being gallant to women and at the same time fighting against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not exactly convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
You want me to make a debt?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program does not seem to give too much interest.
And I am not obliged to deny the campaign from my own resources.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I could not live on the senator's salary alone; for example, I could not finance my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to have your way out?
Didn't you say you were going to return these activities?
But that's not related to the amount of the salary.
As promised, I have partially returned my activities.
For example, in the spring my deputy will become the managing director of the travel agency.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live on something, too.
What month did you get used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that's still the case.
As President, however, I would like to completely stop my business.
The full conversation can be found in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in the head - on the example of Spijkenisse and the recently established Bucherberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and at last there is something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerine on the edge of the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby large company, says, "Yes, it's beautiful, the house."
But I wonder what we need a library for today.
All have Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one's going to any of these old-style libraries today, right?
Pijkenisse, a hardly necessary city of sleep in front of the gates of Rotterdam, is a strange record holder.
The 80,000 inhabitants of the municipality have the lowest education rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to counter this stupid situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to the general education and to reconstruct the seven fictitious bridges on the euro-notes as pretty pinned steel concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to become the master of statistics: a library must come here!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architectural office MVRDV, master of the great-cool bar diagrams and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the thing with common serenity and appeared to the competition hearing anno 2003 with five books under the arm and a grin on the face.
And while the jury was still looking around and shuffled with the armpits, the naughty Maas steered his fine condolences to the size of a pyramid and ended his actionically supported speech with the words: "Dear city community!"
So this is my proposal for the Pijkenisse Bücherberg, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain is spent.
It is part of a revitalization project, including underground garage, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012."
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is the faceless town centre, which until now had no more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian area and a mindless ugly town hall, behind whose white façade one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory in order to make a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of his existence.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression: book orado under cheese bell.
There is a lift that leads through the middle of the mountain, but the true space and reading joys open up in the foot-climbing of topography.
The completely glazed interior is bright and clear, the burned floor and the elegant street lights speak the language of a public town square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You're already looking for park bench, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And books, books, books everywhere.
"Normally the books are standing along the facade, and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have put the classic room configuration on the head and tidy the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the library is well used: offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental centre and home technology centre are located in the centre.
A special joy is the black book shelves, which are sometimes wall-dressing, when brooding, when steps are rained.
Optics, haptics and smell are foreign.
Even fused architects and construction engineers shake their heads on whether the unknown building material is known.
"We wanted to work here with recycling materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project leader at the municipality of Spijkenisse, on request of the standard.
And so, one day, in a Frisian farm, we have come to a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years in the Netherlands, a millimetre-thin plastic fleece has been used as a root base in greenhouses and fields.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile holds one, two saisons, after which it is ripe for the waste.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in these quantities - was pressed to four centimeters thick plates.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) becomes a dark, homogeneous, resilient material that smells a bit like new cars and a bit like sports shoe.
After 105 steps you have arrived at the summit.
At the end of the almost 500-metre long hike, you will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and ficus trees.
They provide an atmosphere, but above all the right humidity in the literature mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but this house, despite the many glass areas, is a preview project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
It is heated and cooled with natural heat.
Although the Bücherberg is under a glass storm, the sun itself is only a short look into the interior on sunny days.
The wide wooden glue binders, which are located across the glass façade, serve as a cover and capture a large part of the sun's radiation.
The space climate is very pleasant.
The rest will be done with full automatic roll-offs.
Stefan Spermon, the first skeptic in the IT industry, already dared to get into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there, too.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls the Boekenberg as a "long overdue soul."
The reason: At the opening a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his personal stock.
This will first of all fill the optical gaps in the library - currently 70,000 pieces - which is not yet fully covered.
The concept has gone up.
The shelves are filled up to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a half-way library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
And if it's just for the ornament.
Thus MVRDV has succeeded in the king's discipline, which is called the identity foundation in the professional jargon.
Spijkenisse has written history of literature.
As young and uneducated as she may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in US-European relations, Berlin is balancing with this at a narrow diplomatic level.
German Wave: At the beginning of the week, Germany had first indicated that it would vote against the request for a Palestinian observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, due to its special relationship with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I believe it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, being too critical of Israel.
During the Libyan uprising in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was about setting up an air ban zone.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
Does Germany find it difficult to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is just turning its foreign policy away from a policy that has been managed by the US, so to speak, towards a German foreign policy.
It is also difficult to see that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans therefore find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still in a position to play their part, but they are on their way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as they have France or Great Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean, specifically from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to take positions in national interests that are independent of those of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the position in the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
That is why it must be careful not to put the public and the elites in the face of the Arab countries.
That definitely matters.
But I wouldn't want to give it too much weight, that's not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the US by abstain from voting on important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that there is a great deal of understanding for the German position in Europe and even in the US.
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even respect itself with this.
Because it does signal that it is taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
There are different opinions in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The US, on the other hand, has clearly expressed its support for a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
Because of American internal policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama government, in secret, has quite a lot of understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot publicly represent this position.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not as big as they always seem.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so much enthusiastic about Netanyahus policy.
Is it difficult for Germany to agree on its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans to have a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not the case at the moment.
So they can't be part of a wider line and instead have to drive things out of their own position.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future, Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe into a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive subject.
But I believe that the Germans are clear that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player - does Germany want to play a leading role at all?
Or is Germany still having a hard lead?
Germany is not yet used to it, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
For example, when we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany takes a greater role, various anti-German feelings become free.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It must be receptive to a variety of neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now the US's influence in European policy is constantly decreasing, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment, who else is staying there?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if they don't like it, they're uncomfortable and make it even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Brand Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, and Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
There is an officially registered name in China, but it has nothing to do with the companies of origin.
However, it enjoys protection for as long as the actual namesakers do not complain.
And even then it's not clear if they get right.
"It is becoming more and more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at the Taylor Wessing law firm, who specializes in violations of the rights in Far East.
Every week, a new case ends up on my desk.
A few additional letters are already enough for the impostors to register their brands.
So Gucci is simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you have Prada-Kny to enter.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, for example the sports product manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with entries from the brand office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company had the trademark Zegna DF Puma protected there, an art name that also served at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is well known that the Chinese world masters are in copying and in the injured intellectual property.
In the large cities there are multi-storey stores that sell almost exclusively forgeries.
But Pattloch's cases are different: on behalf of his clients, he is opposed to the fact that Chinese companies are officially given the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai," a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan."
That means women fishing for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any blame
"This is business-damaging, you have to fight it," Pattloch demands.
"The brand is watered, the single position disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and the process costs of the sectors concerned go to the millions, especially in the case of expensive previews.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury products and the fastest growing market, with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year.
However, the deletion of dubious entries in the brand register is difficult to reach and go into money.
The procedure can take up to nine years, with uncertain results.
Pattloch reports on cases in which the court dismissed actions because after the long duration of the contested name had become "market reality."
If the plaintiff was in bad luck, he would even have to pay the plagiator money because he was violating his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle exists here.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore allowed to use an emblem that is similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-and-white logo that reminded BMW; the dispute was closed, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against impostors from Hong Kong and Singapore who made the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any blame.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing admits that there have been bottlenecks in 2010 due to the lack of staff and space facilities.
Last year, however, one had returned from the "emergency situation in the work process to normality."
Thus, the existence of unworked opposition proceedings was reduced by 22%.
Almost 57.000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, there are still 81,500 objections in the office waiting for the execution.
To deal with it costs a lot
As often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection, almost a third more than 2010.
This was a record and meant that China was leading the list of new applications all over the world for the tenth time in a row.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, EUR 1.8 billion of fees were paid.
This means that each application costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
On the other hand, it costs a lot, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting a Chinese plagiarism.
Although the Germans were able to ensure that their illegal production of imitated car parts was lifted.
But the impostor continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
They themselves have failed to do so because in Germany family names could not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO brand office also rejected the Munich opposition.
In the next two instances Freudenberg was right, but the defendant continues to fight until today.
You have to be very careful.
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be quantified, the company archive even had to see through a hundred years old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side in vain a "high six-digit euro amount" for settlement.
"You can see how much this is worth to us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in Far East are even threatening to go back to Europe.
It is then when imitators secure unprotected brands there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business area has long been abandoned by the Group, yet it was able to cancel the registration.
"You have to be very careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful in business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international brand rights, but foreigners should "register everything that is somehow protective, also in China," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, this can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg was in the last act of his brand drama, then it would be necessary to pay the other side royalties for his own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we're being pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World day: Stamps, singing, helping
In Heidelberg the choir Imbongi is testing - and in Swaziland Aidswaisen are happy about it.
The history of a connection that overcomes much more than 8733 kilometers.
First there is the Stamping: Cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's slippers on the parquet floor are looking for the bar, find it fast.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly swell - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - and persecute and persecute.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his shoes when he brings it together with his gentle wild gestures.
It is Monday night, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi is testing a new song.
The fifty singers have come, between 23 and 69 years old, from the human genetics to the man of the house.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choir voice has a different text and also a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Aid for self-help
There are around 34 million HIV infected worldwide, which is what Unaids estimates, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS.
23.5 million people live in South Africa.
= = References = = = = External links = =
More than 40% of the population are now HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni, the association Voices for Africa Paten has found in Germany.
70 of them attend a further school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take over a sponsorship.
It guarantees the child school money, school uniform and a warm meal daily at the Gogo Center.
In Zulu, Imbongi means storytellers or praise-tellers.
The language of the band can speak fluently in this room, but no one can sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and brings them back from time to time to where they originally came from: to the South of Africa.
For 8 733 km from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voting power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, most of them children.
More than 300 of them have no parents because they are the HI virus.
In Esitjeni, the small one shows what all Swaziland is suffering from: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to Unicef.
A reduction in the male foreskin, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of the people in Swaziland carry the immune deficiency virus, with the middle of thirty dying is not rare.
On a common trip to Africa in spring 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, who were not only deprived of parental care, but simply of everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a school degree, you have no chance in a poor country.
At first it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to allow him a warm meal a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the "Voices for Africa," which has been taking almost professional care of the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts on sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STI includes syphilis, chlamydiene and tripper (gonorrhoea).
Common viral STI are HIV, human papilomavirus, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Filzlöse and Scratze are among the parasitic STI.
Who are the main groups concerned?
Syphilis and Tripper are especially common in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five of all syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydiene infections, trichomonades, candidose (fungus), tripper and human papilomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is relatively low - yet, around 20% of HIV new infections are made up of this group.
Chlamydiene infections are much more common in adolescents than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections concern young people aged 15 to 25 years.
In this country, human papilomavirus are also common in young people.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of HIV new infections has been falling since 2007.
In 2011 there were around 2700 cases.
This is about a tenth less than the year before.
What symptoms indicate a sex disease?
Infectious diseases may cause ulcers in the genital area, urination, flow, abdominal pain, and blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms may reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
For in part, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on by lubricating infections and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular studies, especially in the case of frequently changing sex partners.
In the early diagnosis most STI can be cured and late follow-up avoided.
By patenting, donations and not least the gays that the choir sings all over Germany, a lot comes together.
"We have already sent some 200 000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious and powerful woman, manages the money from Germany.
She also takes care that the orphans are well accommodated, with one of the grandmothers, for example.
The Gogos, as they call the old women on Zulu, are the support of the village.
Some of them have taken up up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children in their uniforms appear on time for school lessons every day.
Those who no longer have no one come to the shelter to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club as well as the two chefs who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has created a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized together with the American health organisation PSI that many in the village have had an HIV test.
This is not a matter of course, because as obvious as the disease is in the whole country, it is most likely that they are dead.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Actually, it's strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, this state-sanctioned life-form is also due to the fact that the HI virus has spread so quickly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
There would be free condoms at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is another - flesh to flesh. "
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels together every two or three years through the South of Africa and sings songs full of weariness, spirit of struggle, confidence and black self-confidence, which many still know at the southern tip of the black continent from times of apartheid.
A bus full of white people who sing songs in a black language - so much recognition brings not only mood and joy, but also some grim border soldiers have put down a few tears.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godchildren.
Even if you can hardly find the small village on maps, it is more than known in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is the light" people say there.
And when you return the 8733 km airline to Heidelberg, to the strolling singers in the test room on Bergheimer Street, you can see it also there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on the Mercury
The probe Messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover may be up to 20 meters thick.
The US Space Agency NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is the closest to the sun, there is also frozen water, as shown by three studies published in the "Science" magazine on Thursday.
The probe Messenger has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the permanently in the shadow region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly also asteroids that have been hit on the Mercury.
But no one links the find of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
The finds could, however, help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life have come to other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the Earth's citizens, probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix are in the process of exploring the depths of space.
From time to time they send pictures to the earth: small holes in the infinite breadth.
The picture comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who is circling the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" after the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This picture section of an infrared recording of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of unnumbered star generations: the oldest stars can be seen as blue points, more difficult to identify are the pink "newborn" in the star circle.
This star-forming region - called unromantic W5 by scientists - has discovered the telescope spitzer in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This shimmering glow of a dying star has taken up the Spitzer telescope of the Nasa.
The Donut-shaped ring is made up of material that the star has thrown out in the death process.
In the huge Trifid mist, 5400 light years away from the earth, new stars are created from gas and dust.

One of the largest and sharpest recordings of the Hubble telescope: The Hot tub galaxy
Depending on the colour, images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The recording published by the European South Observatory shows the trifid fog in the constellation Schotze, which is several thousand light years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-divided, three-split), as dark dust strips cross the glowing heart of the star birthplace.
In the constellation of a snake carrier, astronomers have photographed the progeny of a cosmic carambolage: 400 million light years away from the earth, the cores of two merging galaxies are growing to one another and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
To whom technical abbreviations do not lie, she may call it by her nickname Southern Fire Wheel.
The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows an excerpt from the Irish Bible in the constellation Kepheus.
The 1400 light-years away fog consists of dust grains, which are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was assembled from optical and X-ray images of different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, recorded the space telescope Hubble for the Nasa.
The larger spiral galaxy call scientists UGC 1810.
In this star nebula is the brightest group of young stars on our Milky Way.
The star cradle always produces new young people.
This star cloud, connected to the rosette fog, is also constantly producing new baby stars - 5000 light-years away from Earth.
In this bright-shining galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that he was born shortly after the Big Bang when hydrogen was found in the universe.
Our insights into space: The most important telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - even before Galileo used it for star observation a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have become ever bigger - and the insights they provide have become deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
The large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona, USA.
It allows a look into space equal to two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner life of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
However, it reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the favourable design: The telescope is fixed in its angle of height - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed in the height angle.
Its special feature: the high power of light.
In fact, despite a relatively low mirror diameter, this is sufficient to match the world's largest mirror telescope.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers are listening to alien signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which makes his name all the honor.
With a total of four mirrors, the remote tube can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is to be made up of 42 meters in length - and made up of almost 1000 mirror elements.
But pictures can be expected at the earliest in 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes were considered the largest in the world on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea.
They offer two mirrors each with an average of ten meters.
The Keck-Telescope are part of the Mauna-Kea Observatory, which, next to them, is still looking into the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
A new, huge telescope is also to be created on the Mauna Kea - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be admired on an illustration.
The most important impressions from space, however, are provided by the Hubble space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has already provided pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler has been looking for extrasolar planets - especially those that are inhabitable.
On February 2, 2011, the Nasa announced that 1235 planet candidates had been identified since the beginning of the mission.
In the picture the last start preparations on the space telescope Kepler are documented.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be on board an Ariane5 missile in space at the earliest in 2018.
The primary level of the space-infrared telescope is 6.5 meters in diameter.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to look for light from the first stars and galaxies for the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that there is also ice at the southern pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the Messengers are much closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have been pointing out for decades that there is ice on the Mercury.
Through the Messenger probe, which was launched in 2004, the first to circle around the Mercury, the scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter daily - and become 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A search in the country where 97-year-olds are relatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A search in the country where 97-year-olds are relatively young.
The journey through the Talysch mountains is wild-headed.
The small bus rumbles over the curvature road, past densely wooded hills, riverling rivers and simple farms.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you were in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
This is where the Caucasian group of the Talysks lives, of which not much is known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as asily and is very long-lived.
End of the line is Lerik.
The small town is protesting with too large-scale architecture from Soviet times, which does not even want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too difficult is the arrival of Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
It takes eight hours for the 323 kilometers because the road is only one-shot.
The legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff for tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She's the director of the museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is the Vita of about eight dozen talysks from the area, which is older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
One child was born at the age of 136
But the controversial star of the museum is the Shepherte Şirali Müslümov, who is supposed to have become 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented person who became 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems very doubtful.
"He was born here in 1805, died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he was told to have begotten another daughter.
So did Şirali Müslümov count for a few decades at his age?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, an old-age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of the high-ranking in Central Asia.
"There are also striking many high-age people in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "there are extremely many very old men living in Sardinia too."
However, because of the lack of documents, there was no scientific evidence of age, especially as the register of persons was missing.
Milled butter every day
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
So why do so many high-level people live here in the south?
The Azerbaijan travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talysches.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is the diet.
But that the calorie-rich food of the Talysks should be so healthy, that the meat, bread and especially milk products love and many of them drink a glass of melted butter daily, does not seem plausible from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cenemiran, a tiny settlement not far from the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With her 97 years of age, she is relatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She's sitting on the floor with a butter barrel that she's tirelessly rolling around and around.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both of them are long-standing grandparents.
Two young children also jump around.
In the kitchen you can prepare tea, which is served in the typical, tree-shaped armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfect in rows and glies, under her headscarf she hides long, dark-blonde coals that her son proudly reveals to us.
I used to wash my hair with milk, so they never went out and kept their color.
"I never used Shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to live
She has always eaten only what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life, I haven't bought food at the supermarket once.
Then she tells me about her husband who was in the army.
The worst was the time after World War II.
But everything became better than the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over the rudder.
The propaganda sounds strange from an old woman's mouth.
But the cult that is driven around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows little of the borders in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, and later his son Ilham took over the rudder.
After all, there is no need under Azerbaijan's old man.
230 Manat (about the same sum in euro), Mirzayeva receives a monthly pension, for local conditions an amount of which you can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's son, who has been a long-raged one, is right: "The old enjoy high esteem in our culture."
They live in the middle of the family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that's no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human right" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rivalising citations in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with the Sharia as a basis is strongly controversial.
The Egyptian President did not save with Pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds lies in my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but above all to the Christian Copts, the Liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
For they all, so far hopelessly disagreed in a confusional opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a state of God on the Nile of Graces of the mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
He, as Muhammad Mursi said, almost apologizing, had temporarily cut the powers of the Constitutional Court and extended its powers "to save the revolution."
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who has a doctorate from the American University of South California, really wants to save, is what the Egyptians are about, the world is not fully aware of.
Do you want the Judicities to be removed?
In fact, the 234 articles that the Islamist-dominated 100-head Constitutional Assembly has been through in a night, 15-hour parforcert are partly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that case law is based on the "principles of Islamic law."
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is the matter of interpretation and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the weak wording and the legal scope associated with it for a more stringent interpretation of the Sharia.
This suggests at least a new article: in all matters relating to Sharia, the Al-Ashar University must be consulted, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great radiance in the whole of Sunni Islam.
This does not have to be done, but it may mean that the spirit oversees the legislation, which in fact would result in the deportation of the judiatives.
Much of the draft Constitution is the matter of interpretation.
It is also a problem: civil military justice should continue to be maintained.
During Mubarak's reign, these courts served to suppress opposition people.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were in military prison.
The state should also, as it is in the draft, "protect the true nature of the Egyptian family" and promote its morality and its values. "
This is so incorrectly formulated in law that state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature by means of this article.
In the clear text, that means nothing but censorship.
No article, by the way, explicitly states the equality of men and women.
For this, another forbids the Prophet from insulting or slandering Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult, and how it is to be apprehended, remains unclear.
It is also dubious to say that the "insult of people" is forbidden.
Is there enough caricature from the President or a joke at the expense of a legal scholar?
The question of interpretation, like so much in the draft, which Mursi is present for signature and will be presented to the Egyptians for referendum in his words "very soon."
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition has been forming for weeks against the power of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unaccustomed harmony on Friday night at Tahrir Square in Cairo, and promised to bring the Charter down before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-party candidate of the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei said that the draft Constitution belongs "to the waste mountain of history."
Through short news service Twitter, he accused the followers of Mursis of wanting to lead a "coup against democracy."
"When he calls out the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said the opposition Jasser Said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, appeared to be a counter-demonstration, but not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Nilufer in front of the Cairo University.
Many of the women and supporters of the Salafists took part in it and called out: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They asked Mursi, "Clean the land," and said, "The Koran is our constitution."
A battle for the Highness over the symbolic Tahrir Square, on which everything began, would probably have been a civil war-like state.
That's obviously not what Mursis's supporters wanted to risk.
The Muslim brothers said that both the opponents of the draft Constitution and the supporters had expressed themselves loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the ballot box in which direction the country should go.
A majority in favour of the draft Islamists is considered to be safe.
"The Word Human Rights does not even occur"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this forced constitutional process, which should have gone through February and involved all the social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organisation (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their view of the world, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
He was beaten, convicted, imprisoned for that.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he complains in talking to the "world on Sunday."
Mursi's expansion of power to all three powers in the state had the lawyer resigned.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President will de facto eliminate it," says Saeda.
But without civil society organisations, democracy could not work.
Saeda feels left alone, also by the international community, which looks at the ideological direction struggle at the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be revenge.
A protester on the Tahrir warns, "You feed a monster you can't control anymore."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the most evil-smelling fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards - not only in Europe, but all over the world.
Could the country's secret of success have something to do with the local appetite for pretty bad-smelling fish?
You take a selection of overripe cheeses.
They are placed in the middle of a pile of dirty, moist sports clothes.
And leave them there for a week.
It's about time to imagine the nose-deafening smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway's great delicacy.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There are snow, spectacular landscapes here - and this persistent smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is a salt-sprinkled trout that - depending on how smelly one would like to have his fish - is fermented in water for up to a year.
When the darkness comes over the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norway is going to a party here in Fagernes dedicated to this, well, really very brighter specialty.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire station, but as the so-called "Rakfisk-General" also organizes the festival.
People around us eat small fish cubes and take large amounts of alcohol.
"Some people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk," says Havard.
The spirit drink can displace the smell.
I cost a couple of buns.
If you avoid getting the Rakfisk close to the nose, it's not bad - like Sushi, who has a pretty long bus ride.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling possibilities and fish was soaked in air-tight saltwater barrels in the autumn.
In the deepest winter, it was then taken out after long fermentation and consumed - no doubt under the spirit of alcohol-dampened.
A generation ago, thousands of Norwegian people were forced to leave their country in search of work and migrated mainly to the United States.
Today the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labour market, high wages and comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was far richer than Norway a long time ago, immigrants flow.
Rakfisk is considered to be something important - an essential, though strictly smelling, part of Norwegian history.
He's one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But in fact everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs 10 euros.
Norway does not often make it to the world press, and most people do not seem to mind that.
Here you still hate to call Anders Breivik by name - those racist right-wing extremists who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, they refer only to the "incident of July 22."
Norwegian people are hard to accept that someone in their country of peace is capable of such brutal murders.
Since the early 1970s, the main responsibility for the present wealth of Norway has been the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round tablets with mature Rakfisk and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and the stinging blue eyes.
We are a cautious people, as they say.
Your English is just like that of most people here.
We're not very adored, we don't like bravery.
Norway has been very careful about its oil wealth - a large part of the sector's income is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When, in the years to the world economic crisis, all the money they didn't own, Norway kept its wallet tightly closed.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and go hiking in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, eat Rakfisk," she adds with a full laugh.
I stand in the snow and I stand for another dish - from Rakfisk I have enough.
It's definitely something else that an Elch Burger like that, and the juicy meat is killing me.
But in the evening, the stinking fish is on the menu again.
The hotel, where I'm logistics, is one of several venues to organize a Rakfisk dinner where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - fish.
There is a live TV circuit to a fly-covered showmaster surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You clap and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the Aquavit.
But maybe it's the strict dusk of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto is facing a difficult start
While Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take office, Will Grant of the BBC analyses the challenges ahead of him and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, the traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even on better days this is an ever-blocked city, but on Monday a ring of steel was built, which closed several important transport routes to the capital and provided chaos on the streets.
The aim was not, however, to disturb pendlers on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nieto will have the presidential bond and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderons, Mexico has been able to prove itself economically well, but the country is under the control of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
"My government is strongly committed to reducing violence," said Pena Nieto at the Oval Office at the beginning of this week, US President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Pena Nieto was the governor of his home state, Mexico, before he went to the United States with the president.
In this densely populated, vast part of the country that surrounds the capital, opinions about the new head of state are shared.
A direct man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, one likes to remember him.
The inhabitants of the holiday resort attribute to him the development of tourism and the construction of the infrastructure.
To reach the city, one can drive on one of the motorways that had Pena Nieto built and which are a great improvement over the fragile, bumpy roads that once existed here.
Plackets with his name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect him to make real and lasting changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the Pena Nietos party, the PRI.
In particular, as regards security and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pino, the party has great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations of the opposition, the new President, lack substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has great plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under motorway transmissions and in many ways is a suburb of Mexico city itself.
And the problems in the community are of a crucial urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was deployed to combat drug trafficking in the quarters, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a spot of Brachland near a large landfill, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left alone in the last two years.
During the term of office of Governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistics that surpassed even the statistics of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for their violence and the murders of innocent women.
Critics Pena Nietos believe that he has at least not addressed the problem of women's murders properly during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government has closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the down quarter, Irinea Buendia is fighting with the tears when she shows me photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," Senora Buendia remembers.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the morgue had already been used.
As her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is placed next to a cross that bears a single word: justice.
But this is exactly the one, according to the family, who has been denied it so far.
The authorities have treated me as if I was a snitch, a troublemaker, a nörgler.
They want you to just accept their judgment and keep your mouth shut.
"But this is not possible if there were so many malfunctions and failures," she says.
If President Pena Nieto receives the presidential bond on Saturday, he will also assume a great responsibility.
Ten thousand Mexican families have been affected by violence in the last six years, and the new President has promised to take special care of this problem during his term of office.
"I hope as President he is as governor," says the PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of this.
The prosecution claims that Bradley Manning has not complained about abuse
The D.A. 's office contradicts Bradley Manning's allegations that he was abused in prison.
The hearing deals with Manning's time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defence is seeking a rejection of the charge due to hard conditions of arrest
The US Army's free man is accused of having taken away thousands of confidential documents
On Friday, the Public Prosecutor tried to find that the army freighter Bradley Manning - accused of the greatest disclosure of confidential information in American history - failed to complain about the alleged abuse in military prison.
In a cross-examination of Manning during a pre-trial hearing in Mt. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein explained that documents on weekly visits made during Manning's nine-month detention period in Quantico, Virginia had no complaints about his treatment.
A day before the cross-examination, which was held following an application of the defense to reject the charge - Manning was already sufficiently punished by the hard time of detention - Manning had declared that he had considered the suicide in prison.
The secret service analyst of the US army, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as the source of the information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fein and Manning went through the forms that officials had completed during their meetings with Manning during his detention in the Quantico military prison, where he had served under increased conditions of arrest from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Fein asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had assessed the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the institution as a whole as "very professional."
The forms, the fine ones, did not contain any complaints about abuse, although the officials had directly questioned Manning for his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and that the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they had been involved with them, but they had not been recorded.
"They wrote down (after discussion of concerns)" No problems, "and that didn't necessarily mean that I didn't say anything at all," says Manning.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to examine the suicidal ideation he mentioned a few months ago on a form.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting had been to lower his observation status to "prevent injuries."
The military said it had assigned him this restrictive status - one of which is under the risk of suicide - to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well and to get rid of the observation status to prevent injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life in my view," said Manning.
Manning announced on Thursday that he would be arrested and transferred to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before he was transferred to the Quantico Naval Base Prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that in Kuwait he had considered suicide and had become unconscious because of the heat.
Not to be allowed to know what happened to him or in the outside world was a burden.
"My world shrunk at Camp Arafion, on this cage together," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
When he was moved to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
He was only allowed a mattress, a ceiling, flip flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he was trying to stay on the move, because the day was forbidden to sleep or even to lie down.
He had to sleep with light that went from the outside into his cell.
When he turned around at night and couldn't see his face any more, they woke him up to turn back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally objected to the treatment of Manning.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned an accusation he had raised in his statement on Thursday - so he had to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico for one night and stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners at a morning count.
Manning had said he had never had the opportunity to cover himself with his blanket during this count.
At the interview on Friday, Manning said that he had closed out of an order from his guard that he should drop the ceiling with which he could have covered himself, but he admitted that no one had asked him to.
On Thursday, Manning had said that he was forced to sleep naked the previous night. He would have tried to show an official that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning told the official that he could have used the covenant of his underpants or his flip-flops to hurt himself, but not do so.
That night, Manning said his underwear, flip flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his detention experience and drastically reduce his arrest if he is sentenced to the military court at his trial, which is scheduled for the beginning of next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will commit less crimes, while other charges that are considered to be too extreme are to be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend. The prosecutor's office is expected to justify the conditions of the arrest.
The Pentagon remains in the position that Manning has been held in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners under the highest security arrangements in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the promotion of the enemy, the illegal publication of confidential information on the Internet, the transfer of national defence information and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty in all charges, he is threatened with a life sentence.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to accuse the emigrants - they remind them of difficult times, he says
Navarrette is of the opinion that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the pass control when insanity was spreading in me.
The signs refer to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), the other for "Extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I was there for a few seconds, not sure which one should I go to.
I grew up in Central California and was called "Mexican" all my life.
An ethnic shortcut - just like my friends in Boston call themselves "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italian."
Later I chose "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home there was no need for cuts or cuts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to speak in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I don't get rid of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in line for Extranjeros.
I was thinking about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nito visited the White House to meet President Obama.
The agenda included all the issues that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason that Mexican people are now as likely to stay in Mexico as they are, rather than emigrating to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a North American trade block in line with the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cartel, even if he did not mention details about it.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought of the fact that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced the country's leadership to leave more than half of its territory under a predetermined gun.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
So, as soon as a US government official is even mildly critical of Mexico, one hears - in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country - complaints about how the Americans are harassing the sovereignty of their neighbouring country.
And the children of Montezumas go on the path of war.
And yet Mexico's greatest challenge is in fact in relation to the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States.
You want to talk about resentments?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree, a person - perhaps a parent or a parent - did not get a chance in Mexico and emigrated to the north.
And in most cases, this person was a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness is with them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now have lived the American dream, visited good schools and received good jobs, we must never lose sight that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican one.
Our identity is sometimes blurred, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This is clearly the case for the United States.
We are also aware that many members of the Mexican leadership class do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And then we wouldn't see ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain now - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally emigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take this seriously.
While she is an American citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling that they are neither on one side nor on the other.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but none of them are rooted.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my journey, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the education community want to resume their links to Diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassadors" for Mexico, who represent their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and put pressure on the political leadership to step up their ties with Mexico.
Well.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many injured feelings.
And in view of the unfair distribution of income, unbridled corruption and drug power, many of us are not so sure if it is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through that alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge for how their family members were not treated as long ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected cornerstone of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to stifle such hope in the germ.
In the middle of the usual debt allocations, countless buildings were put in ruins and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis killed - and for the first time, missiles from Gaza have been taken near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these perverts.
Maybe this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly paternity situation could finally come to an end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism seems to be anything but appropriate in view of the current situation.
Even if the cease-fire agreed on 21 November, this week's struggles have strengthened the hard-shot on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement, which has been controlling the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, even though his group itself had to face great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are forced into one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that they have time on their side.
As Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends to their side.
Turkey, a restrengthening, regional power once considered to be Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken on the Hamas party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Jealous Hamas followers believe that around Israel is an Islamist half-moon - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power, over Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist embodiment could stand before the collapse of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the most inhabited and most important Arab country by far - has changed the region's balance on the southern flank of Israel in a sustainable way.
Hosni Mubarak, the laicist despot that ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood with Hamas is weakened and its leaders are more dependent on people's views.
Hamas could prove to be an actor in future diplomatic negotiations, which cannot be pushed out by Israel and the United States itself.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, are making an opposite conclusion.
In military terms, Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli missile defence system, "Iron Dome," has been able to prove itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep more calmly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States is holding its position unshakeingly. Many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest scale of violence.
Israel has been well achieved in recent years, especially among Prime Minister Binyamine Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the blockages that run into the West Bank and thus into the main part of a possible Palestinian state, which protect the Jewish settlements, which were declared to be illegal, but are constantly being extended.
Netanyahu is well standing. His Likud party has joined an even more competitive group in the run-up to the 22 January elections under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why do these backstabbing Palestinians also mess up and leave them to their own state?
If they were actually in control of the West Bank, would they not fire missiles as well as their fellow leaders in the Gaza Strip?
No, it's better to keep them in check behind the wall and punish them if they dare to raise their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to make their way through, but the Arab spring could make them a prank through the bill.
Even if the Islamists, who are now in power in Egypt and other countries, have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
The Israel's defence budget is greater than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to repair their economy.
The fact that pragmatic President Mursi is meeting with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think for the longer term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking slow steps towards democratisation, Palestinians are still deprived of their right of self-determination - a powder barrel that will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli occupied areas, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate this situation.
Over the years, bloody missions to repress Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute.
Both sides need an outside impact
The right answer is the one represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and by this newspaper: two states where Israel is leaving for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more influence to enforce this solution.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar, must now put the weapons in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by the exchange of land and a common Jerusalem.
External Arab nations should also encourage Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
This would be more important for the creation of a Palestinian state than for the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama too must help to bring Israel to negotiations.
During his first term, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Far away from the white house it seems as if it is also reluctant to participate.
But that is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has an essential interest in a stable Middle East.
And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws on uniform cigarette packaging enter into force
Health warnings and sick body parts on neutral green packs that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world's first laws for uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging have entered into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colors with neutral, olive-green caps, which are also printed with drastic images, which show sick body parts and cigarette smoke-infected infants and children.
In addition to the different health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the packages in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small text, will be on Saturday.
Australia thus introduces the world's most stringent rules on tobacco packaging.
The Australian government wants to remove young people from smoking by removing the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
The government is based on studies that have shown that people who have not started smoking at 26 will no longer start smoking at 99% probability after that.
"You can already see in children of young age that they understand the message that they are trying to apply to the tobacco companies with their brand image," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. She quotes studies that, for example, have shown that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have a minor impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It was said that the laws would favour the black market trade, which would lead to cheaper and easier access to cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian forgers will offer much greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have started their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that the demand for cigarette house and silicone covers have increased enormously since the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco companies failed to comply with the laws two months ago at the top of the Australian Court of Justice.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale stores and is waiting for new stocks.
This is a good business for us.
According to experts, the focus is on the popularity of social media, which is precisely the population to which the plan is addressed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, forbidden them to act as sports sponsors and forced most traders to no longer interpret cigarettes in shops. Now, tobacco advertising has changed to the Internet.
The Australian government has prohibited Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"Those who market tobacco and have only one small area left to apply for their products do not come around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, a health care researcher at Sydney University.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has noted an increase in experience reports on brands written by "quite normal people."
One has to ask the question: is this just a private person who is so much in favour of Marlboro cigarettes that she even takes a video for it - or does a marketing agency have to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that industry is focusing on dealing with the new laws instead of marketing.
It has even gone so far as to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - those countries are complaining to the World Trade Organisation about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries are trading more closely with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has had talks with other countries that are considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to provide photographic warnings in 2001.
These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are proud.
The pictures don't affect me.
I just ignore her.
"You just take a chicken and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box where a photo with a mouth tumor is printed.
To be honest, there's only one reason I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the "King of the Pack" tobacco trade in downtown Sydney, says that the uniform packaging has made it difficult to fill its shelves.
"I used to take an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government should have just completely banned cigarettes - then we would have said okay, that's it, we're closing it," he says, clearly bully.
In a constantly electrified world it is nice to be bored even once
This Thanksgiving I spent unexpectedly five hours at the airport when our plane was off due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to make myself bored.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is quite annoying - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts lead boredom than something positive.
When it comes to them, it's okay for us - and our children - to be bored sometimes.
This will force the brain to lose itself in interesting thoughts, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us are almost constantly staring at one screen or another today, the benefits of boredom are no longer of benefit to us.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
I'll come back to that.
As many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see this.
"Indeed, boredom has a very long story," he says.
The house walls of Pompejis depicts a Latin graffiti about boredom, which dates back to the first century.
And then there's the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associated professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom can be defined as the experience of "wanting to do a satisfactory job, but not being able to do so."
Apathy is, therefore, a distinction between boredom and apathy, so that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
In the case of apathy, however, there is no need to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, consists in a "disturbance of the attention process, coupled with a bad mood and the feeling that time is only slowly passing."
It can be almost as boring as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that even though these two conditions may be related, bored people see the problem in their environment or the world, while depressive people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're boring, even if we're just having trouble concentrating.
In her study "The Uncommitted Mind: Designing Boredom in Terms of Attention" - in German for example: "The undoing mind: The definition of boredom under the aspect of attention," published in September in the specialist journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science," Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a band where a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud TV program from the neighbouring room that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so it was hardly perceptible, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who heard the barely audible television indicated that they felt more boredom than the other two groups - they had problems of concentrating, could find no reason for them and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
If one tries to focus on a difficult or exhausting task, the disturbance of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associated professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
However, if you do a one-off activity - "like the search for faulty products on a factory conveyor, music can distract and help not to feel bored."
In fact, he says, we now know that hugs and scratches, often interpreted as signs of boredom, can even fight them by keeping people more physically attentive.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to wander around learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my late flight, a weeping speaker, a particularly tiring film.
But some people are more bored than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers developed a "long-term vulnerability scale" in the 1980s.
On the scale there are statements like "many things I have to do, repeat and are monoton" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything."
With the help of such scales, researchers have found that boys are more boring than girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of Psychology at the University of Westflorida - in particular as regards the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a pretty crowded bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted a pager seven to eight times a day for almost 400 teenagers and her parents.
He found that 32% of the adolescents were bored at school and doing homework, while 23% said they were bored if they were not in school.
But only 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he doesn't know if the percentage of boredom has increased or decreased.
He was, however, certain that "youth is felt to be particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers do not have a great influence on their everyday lives.
So back to my question of origin: is boredom healthy?
Sometimes it does not, because in extreme cases it causes people to take extreme physical risks and to lose their gambling or drugs to relieve them - that's what studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors study the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the subject for more than two decades.
"With boredom, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, Professor of Psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do best.
If you're boring and you use this energy to play guitar and cook, you get happy.
But television can make a sense of happiness in the short term, but they are in the long term.
So if you reach an iPad for your bored child, you can get it off your boredom, but it didn't learn to talk or control yourself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds, "Self-control is moving from one situation to the other."
The child not only learns to talk, but also gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we see them too critical.
Instead, our aim should be to make us feel at ease even away from the constant activity and technology restructuring.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we have to be boring more often. But boredom is the painful, unrelenting desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that in truth, people are only looking for a way to turn off and relax.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated, it is difficult to deal with once the noise has stopped."
In Colorado there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old Community College student and football player Anthony Orozco stands in the south-east of Colorados for a crime in court, which will soon be legal in this state: the possession of some less marijuana rock and a pipe with which he smoked it.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were on a September day by car in Lamar near the border with Kansas when they were stopped.
After the police officer found Marihuana in the car, Orozco was pre-charged for possession of drugs and drug supplies - cavaliers, each with a penalty of $100 - and received a court date.
"We're treated like criminals," Orozco said.
But is he one?
In the uncertain weeks after the state's decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for its own use, the answer for hundreds of smaller drug offences depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of misgivings about marijuana are already being dropped here and in the State of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities no longer pursue adults over 21 years for small-scale ownership, which is allowed by law as soon as the new laws enter into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorados have announced to follow up existing marijuana adelits and still quote people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, are voting to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana business from opening in their communities.
"This situation is developing so quickly that I do not know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, which is east of Denver.
And also regulatory authorities in the state of Washington are scratching their heads.
They are waiting for guidance on the establishment of a licensing system for the production, production, distribution and sale of the drug - with a deadline of 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is considered that Colorado is in any case ahead of most states as regards the regulation of marijuana, where the drug was legalized for medical purposes and then for own use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore well suited for orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesperson of the Department of Spiritual Drinks in the State of Washington.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a coarse guide.
"We have no real precedent to follow," he adds.
The Washington Act, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December and thus also forms the final point of a grey zone in which the state licensing system does not yet exist but is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be clarified at this time - for example, how the state's requirement of "adequate access" to licensed marijuana should be agreed with the ban on cannabis business within 300 metres around schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent an e-mail to his staff in Aurora saying that the prosecutor would no longer pursue minor marijuana offences in people over 21 years of age, and that the police would no longer seek "from now on" to provide evidence of these crimes.
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to enforce urban rules on the regulation of farmers of medical marijuana and would continue to pursue drug traffickers.
In Weld County in the north of Colorados, district attorney Ken Buck has a stronger view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to encourage consumers to withdraw.
At present 119 people have to be responsible for the possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, although many have also been charged with other offences.
"Our authority has a duty to prosecute violations that were committed at the time of the crime," said Buck in a statement.
The reactions are twofold even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, no longer indicates adults for the possession of smaller quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all outstanding ownership proceedings.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time enforcing the right until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of the voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was already clear from the beginning that it would not be easy to agree the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexity of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state led to a profound disintegration among local officials with regard to the great green experiment.
District state lawyers are a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents the accused in court for marijuana offences and acts on the ground as a spokesperson for the national organisation for the reform of marijuana laws.
"They have spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still cannot accept legalization," he believes.
The first countries to treat smaller amounts of marijuana like alcohol are Colorado and Washington as national models for the legalisation of drugs.
While intercessors and state officials are preparing for an age of legal sales, they are also anxious to see instructions from the Federal Government, which continues to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level as a criminal offence.
Supporters of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give in.
Despite several alarming arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the Federal Government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former Obama government drug policy advisor, believes that while criminal officials are probably not going to enter the door to confiscate smaller amounts of drugs, they are likely to be predating to tolerate legal, state-regulated marijuana business under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Before the election, some local local authorities approved Moratoria for new marijuana shops, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the West, decided a six-month ban, which is likely to be adopted next week.
"We do not want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at federal level," said Bob Nicholson, member of the City Council.
Our community has voted against this change of law.
We focus on what the community has chosen and not on what the state has chosen.
A lot of questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I'm Tory
Not only university students of today are attacked for their views
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had visited that university, which I once thought was the world's largest knowledge stamp, for a modern Greek symposia that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry into Worskester College at the end of the 1980s - there I had planned to study history - I had packed my bags again and thus brought about the first scandal of my life.
My father broke into tears.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I left because I had a problem with the fact that commilitons had sex in the next room.
The author A N Wilson said that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yeah, ran because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
My father, Woodrow Wyatt, had been an important advisor to Margaret Thatchers, and I support the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Now, according to recent reports, a new generation of moderate rights students is suffering from similar persecution.
The organised and increasing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them called for equal rights protection last week, which benefits gay, disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College indicate that they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable because of their political views."
They call for a place in their college's equality committee to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Her situation was aggravated by a recently broadcast documentation on political students at BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right," which Tories was an eccentric and Neonazis.
It was shown, among other things, by the former president of the conservative student association of the University of Oxford, who was driving a Rolls-Royce and protesting with a silver-coloured suit and a silver-occupied walking stock.
At other universities, conservative students say they are considered "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees."
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President of the conservative student association of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing left-hand tendency at universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even getting to know us. "
Samuel Roberts, 21 and history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the call for greater protection, believes that such a climate is "unpleasant." The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, President of the conservative student association of Oxford, says that she has observed a growing opposition to students of moderate rights among JCR members.
"This is a danger to the intellectual discourse and to the well-being of members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred for the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
In the previous year, the University had voted not to give an honorary title to Margaret Thatcher, a former student, due to reductions in higher education.
The atmosphere would have even startled Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, when new students meet and the tutors, I got a taste of the future events.
I had the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the mocking of Tory students, but even took part with joy.
Political issues such as the mining strike, privatisation and the government's rejection of sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa have found their way into the wood-filled areas of the Tutorium.
At my first of these events I should translate French texts from the 18th century into English. I had not been caught up with what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled on it.
Pitt was a little man with a face like a cake's dough, and pretty hairy.
"Do Thatcher's followers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students were giggling.
I saw tears in my eyes.
"I suggest that you take a few French lessons in your spare time - so if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt got me.
I returned to my room with my head hanging.
That night, I was in college alone at dinner, when someone tipped me on my shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James who presented himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said.
Unfortunately, it's what it is.
Anyone who's suspected of being Tory is being bullied.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory first-semester people pretend to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I tried to change my mind later.
I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs Thatcher on all points.
This trick should prove to be unsuccessful.
A student in philosophy, politics and economy who had ironically visited Eton College as a conservative, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How's Tory's sex?" someone asked me.
They beat each other, don't they?
I felt the way homosexuals had to feel before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever manage to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet the same-minded only after the darkness is broken?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural desires?
The three years before me, in front of my spiritual eye, spread to a purgatory of agitation and isolation.
The only tutor who openly recognized himself as Tory was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, who had his seat in my college.
He was hated not only for being a more conservative, but also because he had advised Thatcher on foreign policy and written speeches for her.
He was only rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and small-scale and rejected it for his Marxist-deterministerial historical perspective.
In 1997 he took a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not gonna be happy here," he told me.
I started commuting between Oxford and my parents' house and found refuge with more open friends and family members in the city.
I told my father I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed to be disbelieving.
During his time in the 1940s all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said.
They would never do anything like that, not in my city of the dreaming tower tips.
Even my Communist friends always showed perfect manners.
His wet eyes were clouding.
Give the whole thing a chance.
I'm sure you're just being nailed.
It would break my heart if you left.
Extracted by my frequent travel to London, my emotional resistance was weakened.
One of my male friends, including Tory supporters, had given up on the pressure and denied his beliefs.
During a tutorium in the following week, where another historical author had seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I was secretly disintegrating from shame, I admitted that my parents had "brainwashed me," and called me "old fools."
The relief only lasted for a short time.
It was my father who hit the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my bunnies gave up.
When they left, I grabbed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You're welcome to call me a weeping faggot.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer from such intimidation and wickedness in an educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that not only produced 14 Tory Prime Minister, but is still hiding behind an undeserved call of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance of celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture," which was opened this week in London, ABC talks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion machine.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of the accommodation of an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
This has been recognized by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture," a great retrospective for which more than 130 clothes of the Haute Couture have been put together, created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished client.
Valentino has always felt fascination for the tidy and distant world of nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will be visible until March 3, there are a wide range of private letters and photos with the signature of the finest aristocracy, from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, to the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from the humble fashion maker in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
Being in love with the nobility doesn't have to be of a disadvantage.
"At least they don't kick their chicken out on your beautiful carpet, as some beautiful celebrities do from pop music," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We all were happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, closely friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrity.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
The Argentinean model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went home to him for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
At every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music, one recognized and felt his influence.
"All invited people felt important and loved," remembers the "top model," which began their career at the week of the Haute Couture 1995 in Paris.
"He never comes out of fashion because his designs are works of art" she finally says.
Fashion show of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of seclusion, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was turned into a glorious and 60-metre-long walk, which suggests a roll-out: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the road to admire a fantastic "audience," the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti carried in "La Notte," or a coat of wool and leather that belonged to the Emperor Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion dolls, names like the names of Sibilla de Luxemburg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg radiate.
Naty Abascal and the fashion maker, 2006
Many of these clients say the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable."
I remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn / winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty," the ex-Duchess of Feria adds.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and highlight the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and the leader of the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she was wearing a Valentino.
When I was a teenager in Italy, I dreamt of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
At the end of the 1990s, it finally came to this.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying skirt and a draped top with a decolleté that makes his name honor.
"It was a true dream," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat living between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dresses of the fashion maker "with absolute care," "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the related memories."
The "King" of fashion
The big final of the exhibition in Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashion maker called his approach) were necessary to make this ivory silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroidery and a four and a half metre long tail.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the top authority of the trade press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the top society."
For years with the "Savoir-être" of the elite, Valentino is now her best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honor, cumulates Garavani as much as any of the husbands of his clients.
"I have always noticed his refinement, his rest, his well-maintained and perfect appearance," admits D'Arenberg.
I last saw him at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay a month ago.
He was sitting at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was flawless; time leaves no trace of him."
And this is what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human labour animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano put their lives and health at risk when they carry 70 kilos of sulphur over the steep, stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others are literally working in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mineworkers who deserve their lives by getting sulphur from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
For this, he must go down every day to the bottom of his crater, where the sulphur-containing gas from the earth is solidified in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulfur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilos in total, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the slippery paths of stone.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes to climb at the tortoise pace, while keeping the balance and taking their steps carefully so that they do not slip and crash.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed on the slopes of the Kawah Ijen years ago.
Kawah Ijen's mineworkers make 5 euro cents for each kilo of sulphur that they reduce.
At the top, they walk the way between the tourists that they photograph like circus monkeys and walk with the tiring heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has set a little further down at a height of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who since 1960 has been using the presence in the volcano and (never better said) his workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocents) for each kilo of sulphur.
This then sells them for 10,000 rupees (83 Euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the bleaching of sugar.
"As we usually carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each way," explains Anto, who normally makes three routes a day.
For each route, it takes three hours, which is what it is, but at the end of the day it has 138,000 rupees together (11.5 euros).
What looks like a miserable reward for such an inhumane effort is, however, three times what he would earn with the field work.
"The daily wage of the mineworkers here, where at the coffee shop 15,000 rupees (1.2 euro) are paid a day and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euro) is very high," explains the carrier who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There he made 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto and his family returned to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, and this for a reason that is as important in Indonesia as the sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindu, and I brought her to Java to convert her to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, cough frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been risking his life at the Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulphur has already left the first traces with him, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, cough frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I will work here for two more years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than just acceptable English.
This friendly and intelligent, but life-stricken young man could work as a tourist guide, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a tragedy.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and gets up at 2: 00 every morning, because the sulphur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color in the dark shines bluntly.
challenging the shadows, he gets into the crater in the light of a little headlight on his helmet he bought from his own money.
About 400 carriers load the baskets with sulphur on their shoulders on the crater floor.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanized the reduction of sulphur to save costs, and does not provide any equipment to the carriers who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
You will also not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euro) supplement per camera, which the guards of this nature park, together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euro), demand from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human carnage.
"This work is for the animals and not for the human being" is protesting Madrisin, a stable, 42-year-old carrier who has been working on the Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and is assured that he will continue "as long as he can," because he needs the money for the education of his three children aged between 10 and 18.
I'm not gonna retire, I'm gonna die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the throat and chews the eyes when the wind suddenly turns and the mineworkers are stuck in the thick pillars that rise from the crater, the men are so hard that no one is complaining about serious diseases... of course, except for the usual breathing problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders that have deformed from the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back, Unainik with his 53 years is just able to carry 50 kg.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks through a goat path between the bushes to the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometres.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano was my whole life" explains Unainik, opening his mouth far away, in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the oldest with his 30 years also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time is running out, but the poverty of the generation continues in one of the hardest professions in the world: those who work as human lastees on the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singapore people blame them for not having children, for the career, stress and cost of real estate and child education.
"The people of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: let us fulfil our civil duty and create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertising for minzbonbons, but yet - or precisely because of this - they became a viral video on YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local proverbs such as "pushing will be a" bao "(laib) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which has made the video, has the hope that the commercial will reach its attention in a funny way.
Her creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to make people fulfil their "national duty."
This is just something for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the process of reproduction, so we realized that this is a subject we had to deal with.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organisation of speed dating evenings (fast flirting).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: why don't we do something as creative as possible to address this problem, such as composing a rap?
1.2 Children
Those who do not take this issue easily are the government of Singapore.
Every year, it spends $1,300 on policy measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything has had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its governments and its strict social controls.
According to his national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was over 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singapore have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Authority, says that this is due to "better education" and "greater career opportunities."
"This has enabled people to have far more options in terms of life objectives and to set priorities except for getting married and forming a family," she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the higher number of single persons and to the loss of marriage and births, the result of which is the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration in order to counter the reduction of the population has led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the barely cashed Xenophobia blooms against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese who are criticised for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the government party in Singapore achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and charges for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known impact on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenue, health costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to make sure that not so many small apartments are built.
It already has an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has started to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" and may be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single person, and that they will deter the construction companies from building large homes for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by days and even weeks faster than the larger units of residence.
This means that they are much better for our cash flow.
However, it admits that the new standards give the developers clearer guidelines, which have previously been put in the way of obstacles if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, the discussions with the Singapore workers working in the financial district can be seen to have no significant effect.
"The people are very stressed, the apartments and also the education are expensive, which is why it is pushed out by many," says a young manager.
The children can have others.
"It is important for me to have my own money and time" says another man, about twenty years old.
Men and women lead their careers, the stress and the costs of property and education as reasons for their inability to have children.
That is why the Singapore people have the last word when it comes to having children - the government can do so much.
The offline private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private or "the area of private life where you are entitled to protection from any kind of interference."
What is private for someone under the age of 16?
How is this definition applied to its everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he poses when he makes public on the Internet that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15, who are often on the network.
In four of the cases, they linked the term "something very own" to the personal level and "to the password and the user" when they applied it to the social networks.
"I would not disclose my deepest secrets in a post" says the 10-year-old Jorge in trying to explain the importance of "private" in websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not mine, or someone who makes the fool," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, of naked, of crimes, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge is insured to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Among them is the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up to Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone's answering me, I'm just charging them up" he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can talk to relatives in the distance or with friends quickly" he says.
He replied that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown.
Even if someone were to see a stranger, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he admits to not knowing 20 of the people he added to his friend list.
"That doesn't scare me because we have something in common, for example music," he says.
According to the boy, no one has made any comments to him or asked him about his address or phone number.
"If someone pushes me or asks me to do it, I'll just remove him from my user account," he admits.
José reported to Ask after reading a recommendation in Twitter.
The boy is not unknown to experience that is known as a cyberbullying today.
The friend of a friend was blackmailed in a social network.
They threatened him and they asked for money.
"He never knew who it was," he assured.
According to José, the victim didn't close the user account.
"He only did it privately."
He then explains a number of steps to configure a user account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I would if he was unsympathetic to me or I wanted to get him one.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a degree in education and learning, believes that in order to guide children and young people, it is necessary to understand that it is the purpose of the social networks to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for the search for information, but with the appearance of these pages the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, holder of a master's title in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrts" formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants to teach when we are still learning." he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what can be disseminated, published or said, at an age where the maturity is not enough."
"They should also be elective, if it is most important for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people what privacy is, to ask them questions that make them think.
"To tell them not to do it, does not work," he says.
Porras then calls some possibilities: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Then why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like to publish a photo of you, like the one you published by a friend?
You know what the others are publishing about you?
Did you ask the other people for permission before when you label photos of parties?
And one more question: do everyone need to know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to give them the understanding that they have to act online as they do it offline.
They're the same rules.
"Someone outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational advisor, comments that it is essential that parents read the guidelines of social networks carefully.
When they understand all sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you can share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "Don't talk to strangers."
Completion of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, which was announced before and was to be signed in theory by the seven leaders present.
Efe repeatedly tried to get access to the signed document at the VI. Ordinary meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur. Sources in the State and President's office initially announced that they would pass it on after the trial, but then stated that it would be published at some time on the Peruvian government's website.
When asked about the text, they said that the content was set out by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information on the summit was limited at any time.
During the day, only the image of the president's meeting without sound was transmitted in the press room with the message "private session, limited audio."
The few information circulating among journalists was received by the press speakers of some of the Unasur governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press speaker.
The only document that was distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, which led to displeasure among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
The President of Peru then sent the media an e-mail with the "Final Declaration" of the summit, but it was the Humala Declaration and not the official document to conclude the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the III. South America - Arab States (ASPA) Summit, and also on this occasion, despite a strong press call, the so-called Lima Declaration, which was announced before, was not published.
On the official website of the ASPA you can convince yourself that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems were available to journalists, but they greatly restricted access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Court of Justice of The Hague, which will resolve a border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the IGH, which starts on Monday in The Hague, in the process that Lima initiated against Santiago, to listen to the pleas of both sides.
"We will follow and implement the judgment on the differences we are currently presenting to this international court," said Humala, together with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and remains a country that is in compliance with international laws, seeking peaceful solutions to disputes, concluding agreements and subjecting itself to the international courts," added Piñera and greeted Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
The two Presidents confirmed that they would submit themselves to the IGH after Colombia had brought an action against the Bogotá Agreement after a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered to be a serious mistake, in which it agreed to submit to the judgments of this international court.
The summit was attended by the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from the Unasur since 2011 after the resignation of its President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The President-in-Office, Ollanta Humala, opened the morning talks and ended the summit shortly after the lunch time in Lima.
The head of state read the final document, in which it stated that 16 decisions were taken and that the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were set at a total investment of $17 billion.
On the decisions taken, he said that the countries of the Unasur will "take important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, to which we will extend the decisions on residence rights."
He said that measures would be taken to "improve cooperation in the fight against urban uncertainty and organised cross-border crime, as well as measures to improve access to drugs and to the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters."
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) should not take on triumphant trains, but should serve to increase our production performance and to show our peoples a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects aimed at improving the spatial links in South America and especially in rural and border areas... and thus unite our countries and open up new economic forms," said the Peruvian President in a read statement.
Among these projects would be five Peruvian, which were on the cross-axis of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which should ensure a better connection with Ecuador, although he did not give any further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will be used to re-establish the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourly relations was another aspect that was highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before he started taking part in the regional meeting that he expected a meeting with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico, in order to treat the maritime conflict with respect for a judgment of the IGH that Bogotá called into question.
"I may meet with President Daniel Ortega on the morning (Saturday)," said Santos.
"We will review all these ways - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also makes discussions with Nicaragua necessary," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will be as civilized and respectful of this matter as possible," said Santos.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the new President of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the defence ministers of the block met in advance to adopt the 2013 action plan, which aims to strengthen the dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, even though the latter is currently excluded.
Peru has the presidency in time for the regional block.
"South America must learn to integrate citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is an objective, with "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who took part in the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, explained to the state television in Peru that Europeans "killed themselves in the Second World War and in other conflicts" and "are practically a fatherland today."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship that is driving the Member States of the Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community, must be achieved, but there are still reactionary sectors that seek to return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the redesign of the Organization of American States (OEA), with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit to anything, and in return, we always sign the South Americans everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission has its seat in Washington and is financed by the United States," he said as an example of the political asylum that Ecuador granted to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, but that he had fulfilled his "deep democratic values and views on human rights."
He added that there were "reasoned assumptions at the time that Assange would be delivered to a third country and that his proceedings would not be complied with."
He also criticised the Swedish justice, which he had asked for him to be subject to an interrogation on his territory for an alleged sexual crime, while "Swedish case law allows this to be done through a video conference that could have been carried out through the message of Ecuador in London."
Correa stated that there was a risk that Assange's health and mental condition would be affected.
"Since he was in our message, I have not spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but not a serious one," said the head of state of Ecuador.
However, there was a risk that he would take physical and mental damage because he was trapped in a tight room and could not perform physical exercises in the open.
"This would affect the health of every person," he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June in the Embassy of Ecuador in London was the granting of a free letter, which would allow him to travel to Ecuador, and that this would be in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe's. He stressed that there had been talks with London to find a solution for the locked-in founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not deal with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, has a number of procedures at various European authorities," he said.
And "if Britain grants this letter tomorrow, I think this is done."
And when Sweden interrogated Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or about Skype, how the Swedish case law was allowed and in other cases was made, the problem was resolved.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate is "the mediocrity, the evil intention and the lie that defies free expression."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who seek and extort profit," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated that Ecuador no longer is dominated by such journalists "and not by the bankers or hegemonic and piecemeal countries," and took the lead in a re-election of "the revolution to continue the path in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until his next elections, arguing that the organism "must remain hard and must not allow for any opportunism and no coup as legally disguised," because it "destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which promoted the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries, to be "absolutely justified."
This judgment is currently not being implemented.
This is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflict is inevitable, but it must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They must be treated in a comprehensive way so that they can be overcome and looked forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the disputes over the sea borders between Peru and Chile before the same Court of Justice and said that "it is right for Latin America to call international authorities if both countries undertake to accept the judgment, even if it is very hard."
With regard to the possibility of him as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador in order to achieve his third in a row, he stated that he "sees this possibility with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is also very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
I have never personally been interested in power, but under the unfair circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that it was me who guaranteed this likely victory, so I must fulfil this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last period as president, and then I would withdraw from public life.
This also applies when we lose.
"That's decided," he said.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I have just spoken to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he has gone there for a planned, routine treatment, and that he would be expected to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not in any case mean a relapse in the state of the health of President Chávez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State today took part in the 6th Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima, which ended with the call for higher regional integration in order to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause of a death because of AIDS is today too late a detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the results of the investigation: HIV-positive.
"It was like a bomb hit," he says about the moment he got the diagnosis that the doctor tried to "weaken" without any recognizable success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his disease alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such a commitment, that he was celebrating his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), to which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine in the early 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At that time, the director of a IMSS clinic himself failed to say goodbye, "because it led to a dead end."
At that time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who know nothing about their disease and where the virus has already done damage and has exhausted their immune system, and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, that is, after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who is taking up the treatment and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that this information was supported by a respected scientific publication in April this year.
The expert on infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system of people at the start of treatment, and that those who are not drug dependent have greater opportunities: up to 30 years at a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years at a count of 500 CD4.
Simply, the above statements mean that those who receive HIV-positive diagnosis at the age of 25 can "easily become 75 years old as long as they are under control," said this expert.
In order to be able to correct this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of the Mexicans today is on average 76 years.
Even if mortality has been significantly reduced in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (ONUSIDA annual report)), it is nevertheless true that 60% of patients in the national database have died since the AIDS appeared.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and by May this year there are 187 deaths, but it is assured that universal access to antiretroviral medicines has been available since 2005.
- So why do people still die from it?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and that's what's in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we have not had any supply problems with the drugs. The problem is that people come in a very advanced state because they do not know their state of infection, that is, in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to influence global mortality, more early diagnoses are required, so that all people who need this are required to be offered massive recognition tests."
This proposal was agreed by the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also by the patients such as Fabrizio, who had his test carried out at a private laboratory, for the only reason that he had made a friend of him who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS phase and even had the Kposi-Sarkom (a cancer-like tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything's different when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're gonna die, and they don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I'd rather burst three times," they say in my case.
The change was to improve, I feed well, drive sports and take the drugs.
Today, his parents only know he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, do a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO in order to animate with his testimony those who are afraid today in the context of the world AIDS day.
They should take the test if they are part of the risk group. The sooner they know if they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the shop table
There are large holes between the health programmes and the simple citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, journalist from Guadalajara, who has taken on the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In the designated places "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; earlier they were given separately, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
The risk zones for new infections include young people.
"What do you need it for?" is a common mockery of social workers, guidance staff in schools, in pharmacies and in the health system that do not want to expose young people, the correspondent insured.
He proposed that this inefficient distribution be redirected; the condoms should not only be behind the shop table, but in spending equipment in public toilets of facilities that are often visited by young people.
It is not to promote promiscuity.
They are not to be paid for the beer and motel, as the governor Emilio González answered to the question of whether the reserve would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality does not look like this; it is best to bring the condoms closer to those who are already engaged in sexual activity," he put it to the point.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13.435 cumulative cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The state is in the fourth place of new and cumulative AIDS cases, and in the 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of the seizures are caused by sexual intercourse, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because for each registered case there are 4 or 5 people who do not know.
After the United States Court of Appeal has confirmed a judgment that does not recognise the restructuring of the liabilities of the Vitro Group, which has been achieved through a trade conference in Mexico, an incurable precedent is created for each national company with branches in the neighbouring country that has payment problems.
It could therefore be said that the procedures for the survival of the companies that allow the Mexican laws do not apply in the country of the stars and stripes in contradiction with international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment given on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale at the Bancarrotas Court for the northern district of Texas leads to the Mexican companies being helpless to confiscate their property beyond the river Bravo.
However, the decision opens the door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to call the United States Supreme Court because of three inconsistencies.
While the judge points out that the creditors must be subject to the United States' competition law, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal, based in New Orleans, first of all, says that the main proceedings are the trade relationship treated in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in procedures for the insolvency of companies with cross-country profiles is not known.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations model law for the harmonisation of international trade law was created, with the American Law Institute being used as a worse one.
Secondly, the judgment states that, without the voices of the companies, the majority required for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have been achieved, following the recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy mass held by the Vitro branches with their parent company.
However, this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agrmex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities were confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for Trade Competition).
It is also true that, after the vote of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained against Vitro in the United States courts, i.e. the Geier funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, did not reach a majority.
The vote would have been 45% against 37%.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is guilty of his difficult situation as of 2008 in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States that hit the country.
For this reason, the González Sada family is opposed to the same appeal court in order for the vote to take place in plenary, that is, by all the judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not accepted, the Cerciorare objection shall be filed, which shall require the review of the procedure by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious thing in this case is that the court left aside a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the court), which describes the procedure carried out by Vitro under the Law on Trade Competition, and which points out that it had strictly complied with the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Law on Competition.
It is also noted that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for cases of cross-border insolvency that guarantee the equality of creditors and debtors.
Two-band carambolas: a blow to Vitro and to the country.
General balance sheet
After the advertisements by the Mexican trade unions for air transport against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, did not progress for several months, the Asociación Sindical de Pilos Aviadores (Association of the Pilots) has finally made progress.
The request led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now filed a criminal procedure against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of impeding justice.
After that, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to inform the head office of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the operator in order to withdraw from the bank's trust account F / 589 IXE in the name of Mexicana de Aviación 198 million pesos.
This appropriation is intended to cover the purchase of shares of the Administradora Promotional de Hoteles (the professional hotel administration).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and sales centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, supplemented by a housing area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of the Manufacturing Industry) has managed to unite the governors in the south-east in order to resist the monumental facility, which partly destroyed protected areas and is the mother of all the threats of industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government has not complied with a request from the Senate to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassadors in Japan have signed the anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, which is known under the English abbreviation ACTA, the matter has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were taken, although the Senate had taken the opportunity to take it out because it considered them to be a violation of the freedom of expression in the social networks.
Homex long-term
In order to pay long-term liabilities without prejudice to short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex is placing stock exchange certificates on the market for more than 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four equal issues that promise interest payments every 28 days.
The creation of competition
Founded from NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leading information technology companies, a company group was founded under the name Competition, the aim of which is the service market of the software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investment is over $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world bummer of basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was connected to basket sports for more than 60 years and has traveled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large spiritual collection of the history of the country's basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was tied to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, whether it was a player of lower classes, a player of the first national league, an authorised representative and a head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the basketball association.
"I spent my life in basketball with a lot of hats, even at the same time as I was President of BSN, the head of the national team and President of the Association in the 1990s," Reyes remembered at a visit of Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and bear witness to them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those who remember his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15-year anniversary as a co-executive or managing director of the club.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed most, because I was allowed to be part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967 as managing director, co-manager or coach.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five championships in a row from 1971 to 1975.
And then I passed a championship in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good administrator, "says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 m large player.
Do you want it? "
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the free-throw specialist Raymond Gousse, who was one of our best shooters.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had allowed a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would take care of another one.
The Vaqueros Championship with Gasse was granted to him, but already from a distance, because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember the first time we won the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we took fourth place, which should have been Bronze, if not that Canadian referee who made us repeat the last game for the second time, said Reyes.
Was this group of the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as is the one who won the 2004 Olympics against the Dream Team.
But my favorite is the team of the 1991 PanAmerican Games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the US team a fight, as they won against us at the World Cup Bronze.
The team was again involved not only in Mincy, Gasse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and Piculín (Ortiz), but also in the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there in 1990 because of a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great joy was that of the pre-Olympic tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the blocked players because of the events at the PanAmerican Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against every forecast.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was no doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level like Piculín.
And this, without taking into account his career in the different leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good trainers such as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is the best you've achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included BSN in the early 1990s up to 17 teams in one season.
What else do you have to do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their territory and first meet in the national playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today the children do unnecessarily many travel and games.
At least I see the result of the required training and courses for trainers, table-official and referee.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to hear music, see videos of music of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and sometimes I go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always with me.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and became famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas," where he played a ruthless, sneaky and manipulating businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" has become a symbol of the greed of the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died on Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas."
"Larry was back in his beloved town of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role that he liked most," said the family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebration of the harvest thanks.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series, was with Hagman when he died in the Dallas hospital, said her publicist Jeffrey Lane.
He made all the joy that knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life in full swing," Gray said in a communication.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was detected in his liver and he was undergoing a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas," Hagman was known on television as a nice guy in the years 1965-1970 with the sitcom "Enchanting Jeannie" of the television station NBC.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is put on his head when he meets an attractive "jinn" (played by Barbara Eden), who will live with him at home.
He was also an actor of two comedies that were only broadcast for a short time, such as The Good Life "(NBC, 1971-72) and" Here We Go Again "(ABC, 1973).
His film works included well-evaluated roles in "The Group," "Harry and Tonto," and "Primary Colors."
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchanting abhorrent J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS television chain on the Ewing clan and other figures in its surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The proverb "Who shot J.R.?," which was supposed to create the expectation of an episode full of emotions, where the figure of Hagmann was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were bet in competition houses.
The series reached a record at that time.
When the answer in a chapter in November 1990 was known, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers who turned the "Dallas" into the second most widely seen entertainment programme since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, the brother-in-law of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had swung her and threatened to represent her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city, but others also had reasons to want him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, indecent man with a charismatic smile: a devious businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) put on the job.
"I know what is to be on the tombstone of J.R.," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be called "Here rests the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only business he didn't win.
Victoria Principal, co-actress of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as a "huge personality up and out of the screen."
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and remains in our hearts, who were lucky to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success in the television channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just turned, the station informed.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT about how the loss of Hagmann would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Martin was a young man when she got Larry during her marriage to a lawyer, Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck at the stage in New York in the early 1950s, then served in the air forces in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities have their residence.
In 2001, he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life."
"I didn't write anything I believed could harm anyone or hurt him in any way," said the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he worked for liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist afraid patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations are coming and after," he said in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as "don't worry, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine."
He also fought against smoking and took part in several campaigns.
Start of the courses that study the "end of the world"
Every week, students examine apocalyptic issues such as the nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
Every semester, when the religious professor decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the "long back count" of the Maya calendar on December 21, many people believed it was the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect him in the following two months: the destructive hurricane Sandy, some of whom have called "Deudarmaggedon," as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place of which the Christian theorists believe the apocalypse begins.
"I have not noticed that this will be the most apocalyptic semester that ever existed," Charmé said this week to the students at the University of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If someone analyses what happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away, this would be a really good period.
And he recalls that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who offers this semester, which was supposed to be the last in history, courses about the "end of the world."
In Temple, the accompanying Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, students examine apocalyptic issues such as the nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
"We analyse why these ideas are spreading over time," he said, as well as the way in which hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behaviour.
If nuclear material comes into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, the students analysed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they could be compared to real life.
"I have tried to inform the students about what is possible, probably, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an accompanying professor of art history and anthropology, have formed a team to offer a course with the simple name "The End of the World."
"We do not take up 2012 so that we will always keep the option of holding the course back in case the world does not go down," said Restall.
Despite the "coming downfall," students have to study, create projects and take part in statutory audits.
In Penn State, the final exam is carried out on the eve of the Apocalypse, so the students have no other chance than "to continue to work until the night where the world is supposed to end," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more places" Restall said about his course for high-average students who filled with 35 students.
For weeks before the start of the semester, we received e-mails from students who asked if there were still places to go.
The students, for their part, assure that the course is among the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers-Camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect- or religious mentality is actually only a question of comfort or its absence.
25-year-old student Will Wekesa explains that he has seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I have never heard of a lesson where this is taught," he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students interviewed - and less a professor - said to believe in the last date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the prophecy of the Mayas, and in certain ways we discredit them," said Julie Zeglen, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
He notes, however, that there is an apocalyptic fear in Western society that leads back several centuries when people responded to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculation.
"Other people don't think that way," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religious professor of the University of La Salle, who teaches in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question of whether he would know a course about the "end of the world."
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote as an indication of an exception to a higher instance.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that many days were spoken of by the last court over the years, and said that if nothing happened on December 21, "people immediately thought of a new date" or philosophied that December 21 was the beginning of a seven-year period, after which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said that they want to go to celebrations about "the end of the world."
"Maybe I'll call some friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communication.
