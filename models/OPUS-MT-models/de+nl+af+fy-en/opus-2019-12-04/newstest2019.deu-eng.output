DFB Chief Grindel sees no basis for oil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that depends, of course, on the fact that one comes into conversation with him, that one also talks to him about why he apparently felt the one or the other as stated in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmower" of the "Bild-Zeitung.
Despite the months of debate about the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regretted the resignation of the 92-time national player Özil.
"I would have been pleased if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed that it would be so until a certain time, "said Grindel.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and was also based on the fact that Grindel did not defend him against racist attacks during the World Cup.
The DFB chief repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a discussion with Federal trainer Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to build pressure, but he knows it from football so that when "you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with his coach and I find it a shame that this conversation has not been achieved so far."
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergarten settlement burned
At 2: 13 p.m., the professional fire brigade Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angeraufweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the Schrebergarten settlement, danger was in delay.
The professional fire brigade went out and found the cabin in full fire at the time of arrival.
The roof had to be practically removed from the whole and fire debris removed to the absolutely necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden cabin, he had a battery for the store at noon.
This might be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire has yet to be determined, as well as the cause of the fire.
However, it is likely to be significant, because the owner had many collectors in his garden cottage.
Angry mother resists: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open road
What has Lindsay Lohan done to this very strange action?
She obviously wanted to take the children away from a supposed refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has himself streamed live, as she seems to want to tear the children away from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and published a partial cut of the stream.
Here you see "Good luck kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows how Lohan gets out of a car and goes to a possibly homeless family that she wants to be a refugee family from Syria.
When the family is running away from the actress, Lohan follows the parents and their children.
She accused the adults of trafficking in children.
She doesn't give any evidence for all of this in the clip.
"The whole world sees this right now," Lohan is in the video to hear her follow the family along the road.
Apparently, she's trying to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, the obviously angry mother seems to be enough.
It looks like she's turning around and missing Lohan an ear hit.
Under tears, the actress then controls how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheek.
What has moved Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe was launched in December 2014 in Japan.
It should approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The "Mascot" country will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign Ticker: Number of dead on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of strength 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there is talk of at least 420 death victims.
The number of victims could increase even further.
The rescue teams have not yet penetrated into the devastated and cut-off areas of the world.
Elon Musk resigns as a Tesla supervisor
There was a tweet at first.
At the beginning of August, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk was worried about the stock markets when he announced a withdrawal of the electric car manufacturer.
The US stock exchange supervision has sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla boss is withdrawing from the Supervisory Board, but he is allowed to remain chairman of the board.
The British Conservatives' Day of the Party
Shot guarded - the party day of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
On the day of the party it is to be about foreign policy, trade and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, at the front front of the ex-Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in Northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been fighting about these names for years.
Now they've agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future, and that is what the population is voting on this Sunday - whether it is going well?
Protests in Brazil against legal populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") - means Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is split.
Thousands went to the streets in several cities to protest against Jair Bolsonaro's right-wing list.
The "Trump of Brazil" is an anti-system candidate and is in the front of the polls.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: "Diesel gate" reprocessing takes longer than planned
"The Diesel Task Force is still in place," said Peter Mertens, the development board, the "Automobile Week" industry magazine.
In December 2017, the Audi Chief Rupert Stadler, who was detained and suspended, announced that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine / transmission combinations were expected to be tested," he said.
Mertens said: "At the beginning of July we have achieved an important stage in the process of reprocessing the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The Taskforce was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi-Mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car manufacturer had made "serious organisational changes" so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and intends to continue to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigation authorities are proposing to the Audi Chief that, after the exhaust gas fraud has been announced, the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values should have been authorised.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
At present, the company is the head of the sales board, Bram Schot, as the head of the board of directors.
Due to the change to the new exhaust gas and consumption test standard WLTP, there were production failures at Audi, said the "Heilbronner Voice."
In principle, he sees a falling demand for limousines such as the audio models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot is counting on electric mobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there were already 15,000 reservations.
Grindel is seeking re-election - Lahm is to go to the DFB Bureau
Mainz (dpa) - Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, Reinhard Grindel will again be running for office as DFB President next year.
"I do my job and I try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel as a guest in the ZDF's "Current Sports Studio" on Sunday morning.
You have to try again and again to make a re-election, I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
The head of association would find it "strange" in his own words if he did not "want to work on the future project after the award for the football-EM 2024."
Grindel has been the head of the association since April 2016 as a successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who was overthrown by the summer fairy tale affair.
In the autumn of 2016 he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will be taken at the DFB-Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM chief organisation Philipp Lahm is to be involved in the DFB Bureau.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he would continue to be consulted in this role in the Bureau and then, of course, warmly invited to provide his experience on sporting issues," said Grindel.
He did not want to take part in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as the DFB boss.
As a consequence of the affair about the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in future a national player without a migration background should become an integration ambassador to the DFB.
At present this office is the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
"If one without a migration background has a clear impact on society and football and says," The issue is important, we have to take care of it, "that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local associations where integration must work," said Grindel.

Basketball-Bundesliga: Clear start for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started with a clear victory in the new season of the Basketball Bundesliga.
The vice-master won a convincing match with 112: 55 (52: 31) against Science City Jena and offered over 40 minutes.
New access to Rokas Giedraitis was the top score of the dominant Berlin with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 counters) from Ludwigsburg also showed an attractive performance in his mandatory game debut before 9113 spectators.
= = Career = = Brose Bamberg was the first to win the first season of the season at the end of the season.
Augustine Rupit was the best of the guests with 24 points.
Würzburg-Profi Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 meters.
The last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg forced the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83: 76 (41: 34).
New national player Karim Jallow was the best shot in the team of coach John Patrick with 24 points.

The new playmaker Will Cummings overcame the Oldenburgers with 25 meters.
The Braunschweiger, in which NBA-Star Dennis Schröder has been a majority owner since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26: 1 run of the baskets quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on his three-day visit to the state.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to deliver the supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to act against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or the Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship, "he said.
For the opening of the Ditib mosque, the city centre of Cologne had been partially closed.
Several thousand police officers were in use - among them also snipers.
The Islamic Association of Ditib is in criticism because it is considered to be the extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against poverty: stars, buhrufe and horror second
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have promoted more commitment to the fight against poverty and diseases at a joint concert in New York Central Park.
"Engage, wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival in the night to Sunday, about 60,0000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, that's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with French and gold microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Also actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organisations, showed themselves on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In the meantime, however, there was a fear second when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was a shot, got scared and tried to escape.
In short, panic arose, people were getting confused.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said Hugh Evans.
The New York police and the musician Chris Martin, however, calmed people down from the stage.
"No one's trying to hurt anyone," Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available on the Internet for free as every year.
Those who wanted to get one had to read and disseminate texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and diseases.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were the audience's cheers and applause - Buhrufe, on the other hand, for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He, together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons, spoke out on the stage for greater equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had expressed himself in the US Senate Justice Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court, and so many women came to the head.
At least three women have made allegations of abuse up to the attempted rape of Kavanaugh, which he rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations, after two women who have had sexual assaults on their own account confronted him on the way to the committee meeting in a lift.
"You can also meet me at any time in an elevator," Flake said at the concert in New York about the audience.
Freedom of the press: Federal Government Defends the Rejection of the Journalist
Steffen Seibert, a government speaker, has defended a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the office of the Chancellor, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had covered a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had entered the first row.
The T-shirt, had not been the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was about a disturbance in the course of the press conference.
The journalist's action had caused a strong unrest, which was unacceptable.
He has therefore led the man to take the man out of the house.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellor's Office.
This is entirely true, whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or of supporting or membership in forbidden parties or of the Fethullah-Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership is responsible for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are threatening to be detained for several decades.
Foreign journalists are also not safe from the Turkish authorities: the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested only at the beginning of September.
Finally, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had made an appearance.
They were released and were able to return to Germany, but in Turkey there are still trials against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
So fresh and good-looking, his fans usually know him: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at it twice: Yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for moist conversations at the counter of the Hamburg port bar "Schellfischpost."
Moderator Ina Müller comes up with her guests on some beer, some wine, or even more high-quality drinks to loosen the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities also drink courage for the obligatory singing deposits.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz is known from movies such as "men's hearts," "terror - your judgment" or "The most horny day."
The trip to the high north was not good for the Münchner, however.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely broken on it, the eyes only two little slits.
The bed selfie shows a fully-fledged Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he only has a powerful hangover.
He posted some - probably not quite serious - insights to his fans, which he has now won: "Rule one: NIE goes to Inas's night.
Rule two, never drink the black sow.
And spray.
And the round of egg liqueur, which Ina throws at half past three, also leaves away.
The alcohol consumption is really written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans posted just a few tips to fight the propensity.
They were enough of instant broth, fish rolls or - probably the most targeted - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the view of the usually attractive cinema star.
As Ina Müller has survived the night-time drinking, it is not known yet.
But since it has been moderating the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tested...
To a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and treason
The entrance to the 36 km long railway road in the Red Käppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and to find.
Recipes against the grating vandalism are sought, but solutions are hardly visible.
Scherben, cigarette chickens, waste and scrap, demoted waste bins and now dismantled signs - this is how the entrance with a seating group has been presented to the bike path on the Haisse hill in Treysa for a long time.
For the front-view of the railway road in the Red Käppchenland, a more than unruly sight.
The subject has been occupied by members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for a long time, according to the bicycle traffic officer of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been raised in the Radverkehrsberat.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals range from the transfer of the seat group to the regular emptying of the waste containers and the cleaning of the area at the entry point.
"I think the latter is the commandment of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reported that the issue had also been brought to the local council.
Not only the trash is driving cyclists and residents around - the sitting group is a regular meeting point for celebration on weekends.
Not only does it often go loudly, but the rags also destroy: posts torn from the earth, garbage bins demobilized, signs snapped, seat furniture lubricated.
Volunteers would have cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions were only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are annoyed that the rest place on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting point for the swimming ground.
"Along the entire cycle path here is clearly the focus on the Haasse-Hill," confirms the bicycle traffic officer, who is now also concerned about the new wheelstation in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it gets really expensive."
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "This may set the threshold of a much higher level of access to common goods.
This would, however, require a police strike to come by soon.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wishes to develop the Haäß-Hügel.
It had to be made more attractive.
The frequency of the cycle path so far could be very satisfied.
The marketing of tourism is still extensive.
Our bike path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany, "says ADFC members.
As a very critical point of danger, ADFC member Susanne Klippert estimates the situation in the Asheröder Straße in Treysa.
There's no sign of a drop on the Haisse hill.
In the case of good traffic, cyclists may have to wait between both-side traffic flows in the middle of the road, "she explains.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but it is a problem for older people and especially for children.
Music contest at the cultural station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in cooperation.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the city part-time Hiltrup, in the "Music Contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians."
A contest "with eye-wrenches in the sympathetic Hiltruper family," as Karl Franke said.
In fact, it was soon a family co-operation with coffee and cakes from the volunteers of the cultural station.
Seven formations came from the one-man band to the great ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long time in Hiltrop living Albachtener, the Nine from the "Hiltruper Star Colors," three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus, a ensemble from the Lummerland kindergarten and finally Rike Wessling and the Black.
This contest, said district mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a novelty.
We haven't seen that in other parts of the city.
What were the texts connected to?
The Hiltruper Lake and the market allee were particularly often mentioned in the places.
Rolf Ihmig cut the Allee into the "Kö von Hiltrup" in his beat-like song.
The cultural station was also appreciated.
It has always been about the experience of one another in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short remodeling breaks with short interviews with the performers or references to their work.
It was learned from Humberg that he had actually studied chemistry, but now he also teaches guitar.
From the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke was able to report that the latest appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has placed all the way on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
There was, however, something special for the favorites of the jury - so that others can hear their songs.
A whole CD can be played by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound technician Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: with his Hiltrup-Schlager, who especially impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two teachers of guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like all of them, the children also appeared again at the final - and even without electronic support "really good," as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects originality, reference to Hiltrup, intransigence of the melody and recognition value.
The jury belonged to Gisbert Keller of the Westfälische School of Music, Andreas Klovass of the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Economic Association, as well as Jan Kaven, Chairman of the City Teilotensive.
The city part-plan had created the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She considered the event to be a full success.
All were "very satisfied," and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The Word Game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each side there is a view screen, in which four cards with keywords can be decipher - the old trick with the red slide - only when you put it in.
This ensures that the opposite side cannot read anything by mistake.
On the maps, for example, you can read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2nd window.
3. Cube.
4. Fest. "
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
For there are not to be guessed the terms here, but codes.
alternately one player per team is the encryption.
He gets a code card that says "3.4.2."
In "Decrypto," the terms behind the secret film are not to be guessed, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "dice," "festive" and "windows" - so that his own team can recognize the correct order and as far as possible not the opposing team, because that will win the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
The Encrypt thus notes and reads out loud: "Throw" for the dice, "Lose" as opposed to the party; here, of course, something like "party" and "Prague" would be possible because he was watching the school and knew the window crash there.
This is the way to go round by round, team by team.
One does not know the terms of the other side - but it can be better together with any indication that the Encrypt gives there.
As mysterious as possible, but not too far-fetched, the rewrite should be, otherwise it will be unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is, unfortunately, the rule book.
The players probably have to study it for quite a long time and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info on the network makes it easier.
But once you have started, you will be fascinated by how much feeling is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not as conclusive as predecessors and genre-primus "Codenames," which also puts an agency theme on a game of less words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And those who are only concerned with rates and not with points of victory can easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: You show police hitcherruss and harass guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach twice the night from Saturday to Sunday.
He first showed the Hitcherruss in the Upper City of a passing police strike, later he also noticed in the Upper City in a pub when he was harassing other guests.
After he did not comply with the police-issued space reference, he had to spend the night at the police inspection of Kulmbach in the prison cell.
In the sober state, he must then also be responsible for the use of the signs of non-constitutional organisations.
Pressig plant was home to the Schubloks
The station in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
"When buffers hit buffers, they heard it in all the press," Georg Dinkel, who archived the history of the place and the station.
That didn't upset anyone.
And the brakes were squeaking, and the wagons were squeaking.
It was just a train.
Statements that are useful for the home of Dinkel Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so marked by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep-disaster mountain line to the north, which, after an increase of about 220 meters, has its turning point in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to do this, train and shovel locomotives used to be needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Land Day approved the construction of a railway station with 21 train stations, an apprenticeship workshop, a driving and a railway station.
"The centre was the hub, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a redesign in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and professional seisenbahnner for 47 years.
The station (BW) Pressig, which was under Bamberg in 1968, also operated Loks for the nearby routes Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalt.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight elloks were stationed in Pressig at that time.
The electrification of the 1939 route already minimised the need for train and shovel locomotives.
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10 000 weighing units were still in operation.
In 1982, parts of the plant, the rest of it, were demolished in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that we did not consider a better use of the site, including in terms of freight transport."
At Pentecost in 1989, the railway department of Nuremberg celebrated the anniversary of "50 years of electrification of Nuremberg - Saalfeld" a pompous station festival in Pressig.
"There were 10 000 enthusiastic viewers here," Georg Dinkel remembers.
It's a little late for the out.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were taken off, and the Pressig Ranger Station was history.
"The rangiers and infirmary workers did the most difficult work on the train," Dinkel recalls.
Any misconduct would have had fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen station has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures are available here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with opening success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledonneister Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have already reached the second round of the tennis tournament in Beijing as before.
Kerber won the China Open 6: 2, 6: 2 against the French woman Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the world rankings is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spanish Carla Suárez Navarro.
Victory led 6: 3, 4: 2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the Russian woman set to number 13 gave up.
The Swabis now gets to do with Anett Contact from Estonia.
A special exhibition in Mittelerenbach was opened on the weekend in the context of the series "Art and Pleasure."
With great relief, registered organizers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when the special exhibition "Windspiel Performance" was opened in the open area of the Dahlmann- Schmidt estate, Mittelerenbach.
It takes place under the roof of the "Around Walberla" tourism association in the framework of the series "Art and Delicious."
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
The fascination of the exhibition was a great visitor's wish.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelerenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the exhibition.
He's been with him since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
A little surprising but hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
But with Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer he put his task in proven, young hands with a good future perspective.
Both have been active in the selection of artists in the past and have been involved in the design of flyers.
This year again there is a 70-cent special letter brand designed by them on the occasion of art & pleasure, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanten," designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was happy about the high commitment of the special exhibition.
For the musical framework Max Marcus Stadler could be won from Nuremberg.
The passage through the generous garden quickly makes it clear to the visitor that the title "wind-play performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it in a playful way.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramic, often with coloured accents.
At the entrance of the estate, the visitor is already waiting on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree-stump, color-lit, playfully equipped with 20 wind wheels, 24 horseshoe and 24 alu tubes as a sound.
With the sun in the background, through the bush, the object has a fairytale and invites you to stay.
From Eckental comes Barbara Wasscheck, who is preferred in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K & G.
There are many parts in the wind in motion.
On half-way, Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child."
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful fantasy structure of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme of "wind play performance" for climbing through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited by 31 December 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 albums: singers celebrate 50th birthday festive
1968 - that was the time of the protest and the student movement.
And the people of the Book also made their disgust clear at that time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to partout with the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Caecilia" there should be no more singing life in the district.
It has now become a legend: on a bank in the tin bush they raised the MGV 68 albums from Baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Encounter."
"It's going to be full today," former President Jürgen Holsteige, and he should be right.
150 guests were there, a real success for the Albachter singers.
They had made the foundation festival relive, especially for the anniversary.
For years it was a tradition, then there was a break.
On time for the 50-year-old, the tradition festival was back.
An elegant ball was asked to have festive clothes before.
The guests did not sit as usual in the "House of Meeting" in series of seats, but were comfortable at tables.
In the meantime, movement was said: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln put on the regulators and asked for the dance floor.
Honorary thing that the singers of the MGV 68 albums made the voice sound themselves.
The occasion was the occasion for happy songs.
Almost already set: "Such a day, as beautiful as today."
The exquisite grape juice, which many had before them, was the "Rüdesheimer wine."
In an allusion to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus," which is the Latin name for "hops."
Once again, the choir line of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the tin bush at the time, was sovereign.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," said Holsteige: "He has such a light way, it's a master's performance that he does." This time not only men presented themselves sangerically.
The women's choir "Hohe C" was also a guest, whose repertoire includes mainly Evergreen from the 1920s to the 1960s.
After all, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at the desk until 3: 00 in the morning to create his own rhyme.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented well-sounding poetry.
There was also a big Tombola.
The proceeds are intended to finance the children of the Albatros youth centre a visit to the Allweterzoo.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high-class Derby against BW Aasee
The ascent is marching.
Three games, three wins - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring is really well in league three.
No sign of fright or frickin 'out, the independent are doing their thing.
And that at 3: 0 (25: 15, 25: 23, 26: 24) against city competitor BW Aassee really good.
"That was not a glass, but we have already left an impression," says the somewhat satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed to this: "This is a defeat that we can live with very well.
We are not dissatisfied. "On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party of Ronja de Boer the mood was good, the game was cut off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical deception.
In the third sentence, the guests had a set ball.
"When they bring it to the goal, such a game can already be turned," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its routine forces and brought the full yield to its goal.
"We all know who is on the other side of such a derby.
That doesn't break our neck.
I have seen really good volleyball in a phase-by-step way, "Annacker did not have the 0: 3 - and immediately went to the agenda.
Where the journey for the independent is going, just three days of play does not seem to be possible.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd League has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable with regional league volleyball. "In the fourth league they don't want to look down any more.
If the vest is not contaminated in the next few weeks, they must look up.
A first balance sheet can only be drawn after ten or eleven games.
On Saturday we go to Emlichheim.
Aasee will be in Essen on October 14.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dream ship," Heide Keller became a star.
Now she is openly talking about the fact that the series may have had a share of her marriage-out with Hans von Borsody.
Her role of the head hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "dream ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she went off board forever.
The series that made her a star could be co-responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929-2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled with a suitcase alone around the world, and many of my colleagues, who were admired by me, saw me at an eye level, "says Keller in the conversation with the" picture on Sunday. "
At first she had always been only "the wife of Hans von Borsody," but that has changed with the "dream ship."
Because now the journalists only called at Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it so much."
She considers it possible that her husband at that time might have been jealous, but "how many men did Hans also hate to talk about problems and feelings."
Keller has always tried to be the only one for Hans von Borsody "and he did not want to get to know my fears, my weaknesses.
This means in good German: I have changed, "as she explains.
She always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman that I was never in truth, even though I sometimes appeared cheeky and brave on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever. "
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes once again, "although I was afraid that it could also go wrong a second time."
The day before the state wedding, I was sitting in the dressing room crying and trying to cancel everything.
= = References = = = = External links = =
Why didn't it ever work out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller introduced himself to love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I've gone way too naïve to love. "
The night fold, which regularly explores the night life of the city in the district of Zurich, has been the subject of the ZFF opening party this time.
Our clover is not a moth, but a little bit of a shrew.
And the bright shine, in which a green carpet has been dipped on the six-hour square, blends it over a fee.
But it's just a film festival, where more or less famous people want to sun in the spotlight.
So on this late Thursday night he torches over the square to make it easier in the "Aquaclean WC oasis."
This is the name of the public toilet system sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: the need facility in the parterre of a new pavilion is making a lot of effort to create a luxurious atmosphere.
This evening, however, it stinks in the Lord's oasis for some reason to heaven.
So get out here, over to the other side of the road: invited guests who have just had a good time in the cinema next to the opening movie "Green Book," like every year, celebrate the festival with a party in the three-storey warehouse.
His name fits perfectly with this film festival: the works shown are well known from the whole of the globe.
What do you have to do with an article about this festival in order not to fall into loop advertising for its 190 partner companies?
The Flanter binds a little bit around the feel that gave him a good fairy, and two bully doormen actually wave him in generously.
In it, the lauders are pushing themselves, they dance far after midnight to live music or can be prepped by DJ rhythms to which they yell at each other, and rinse down with Cupli exquisite buns.
In the delicacy shop in the basement oysters wait for sloping mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is cut up fresh, a chocolate fountain is sprouted.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The Fold studies the sign at the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator."
If that's two separate instructions, he's been in the dressing code.
But it's more of a conditional construction, and it's certainly already saved lives.
In the household department on the upper floor, the poultry tilts a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye," suitable for the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents himself, does not get the price for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been buying that brand for years, is not here that night either.
But there is a face that is known to the observer: Peter Farrell, the director of the opening film.
His main actor may not be far.
And really: Viggo Mortensen is about to walk through the crowd, with almost sixty of them acting like a chorabe.
He's not being squatted, he's not gifted, he's being stoned at the most.
Especially for this restraint, often misunderstood as a clandestine, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dances
Trainer and ex-football star Diego Maradona are happy to win his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2-0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach with a player in the cabin danced to Cumbia-Rythmen, as can be seen in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in the yellow jersey, fired by the players.
The Mexican second-ligist had defeated the Leones Negros on Saturday at 2: 0.
After the game, Maradona called in a TV camera "Always with my boys, always."
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Association League 1: ASV Send after last minute break "destroyed"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball association leader ASV Sending, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat." His protesters were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29: 30 (12: 14) - bust - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.
As in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, they had not played badly over a long period of time, the senders.
Only the initial phase "we have completely slept," was the ASV coach angry.
At 8: 1 the house lords quickly led, even the early time that Bieletzki had taken, did not produce at first.
"But then suddenly a ruck went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter of an hour.
At the break, the backlog was only two more goals.
In particular, Senden's Best, Marius Hintze, met one time at a time.
After the change it became even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst turned out to be 15: 15, then the season changer almost carried on.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly soothing three hits (29: 26).
And then?
The impartisans were involved in the event.
Bieletzki is usually afraid of looking for the blame for others.
But: the 120-second time sentence that Steffen Mühlhoff cashed, "was a joke."
LIT had a good laugh and met up to the end four times - while the decimated ASV failed even in the last attack.
The boys have fought well, stood in the back also well against seven men and repeatedly threw on the empty gate.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a fucking victory has to come," said Bieletzki, who was unarmed.
ASV gates: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).

Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of a then 18-year-old from Naila (district of Hof), the police are looking for the death of the woman.
Forces dug up a road on Saturday at Marxgrün.
To this end, the street cover and several layers of it were removed, as the police and the public prosecutor reported together.
The missing person may not have been buried far away from her place of residence.
The woman has disappeared since November 4, 1986.
The investigators did not rule out a crime at that time either.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court, together with the Public Prosecutor's Office, has been working on the case again intensively.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Department of Monuments, the investigators met with a ground radar at the street near Marxgrün.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials closed the place down to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced in the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows what are the dangers on the network.
However, users themselves can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated letters, users should rather use passphrases to secure their accounts on the network.
In addition, security updates, for example for Windows, should be installed quickly, even if it does not harm to equip computers with antivirus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his threatening resignation as head of the company of millions of years.
He and the US Stock Exchange Supervision SEC, in which Musk could have lost the permission to run listed companies, brought an extra-judicial dispute about misleading Twitter messages.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay $20 million each, and for three years Musk will be the Chairman of the German Supervisory Board, a position similar to that of the German Supervisory Board.
The head of the board may remain against it.
In the comparison that has yet to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted any misconduct.
The SEC had sued the well-known manager in front of the U.S. Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, also the SpaceX space company, is the public face of the loss-writing electric car pioneer, which is now rated at more than $50 billion on the stock exchange.
Musk is not aware of any guilt
Musk explained that he did nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed at the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter supporters that he might take the company off the stock exchange, paying 420 dollars per share, that the financing was secured.
Tesla would have been rated at $72 billion in total.
Later, Musk returned: Tesla stays on the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla now has to find a chairman from outside, hire two independent board members, and also set up a committee to monitor muscle communication.

Surveys: 46 percent don't want Merkel to be a Chancellor by 2021
After the quarrels of the past few weeks, the GroKo is collecting several survey-low-rates.
The SPD falls back in a survey behind the AHD - Angela Merkel is critically seen.
Berlin - The afD has overtaken the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the first time in Germany for the picture on Sunday.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AFR increases by one meter to 17 percent, the SPD gives a point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only get to 27 percent.
This is the Union's deepest value to date in the Sunday trend.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
According to Emnid, if the election were on Sunday, the government parties would have only 43% of the votes.
This means that the great coalition has lost the majority of the Sunday question at all major research institutes - except Allensbach.
The government parties come to 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 percent).
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
For the other parties, the range is also large: the AFR, in several surveys the second largest party, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach votes from 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is on average 10 percent, and FDP is 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down, depending on the proportion of votes.
But the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also fallen significantly since the German Bundestag election in 2017.
At the moment, only 48% of the citizens still think that Merkel is the right one in the office of law, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS showed.
According to the survey, only the second (50 percent) wishes the great coalition to hold the next regular Bundestag election in three years, 41 percent are for a new election.
In a further survey published on Saturday, there was also a clear loss of popularity for Merkel.
The Germans also assess whether Merkel should be running for the CDU Presidency again in December.
According to Emnid, 47% are in favour, and 44% are in favour.
As a result, 64% of the Union's supporters wish to have a candidate, 35% not.
Outhang at Aldi: Price reduced to love happiness
Is Aldi going to be Tinder 2.0?
Who says in times of Tinder there are no more romantic acquaintance stories - he should talk about turkey at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket as a place of acquaintance for great love radiates almost an anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer's shorts at the vertigo table or the favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere Swipe to the right.
The Tinder app is called to be less a contact but rather a slippery stock exchange.
We have dared the test: How do women react, in the first news you don't talk about the hot break for long?
Here's the amazing result.
The right Hollywood Lovestory potential is when the love happiness is preceded by an out-of-the-eyes-lost-and-found-plot.
If the guy then also reports to his worshippers under the e-mail address bio-putenmein @ gmx.de, it sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this Annonce in an unknown Aldi branch to wish that she will also find her dream man, with whom she has briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced organic turkey meat."
For the belief in the magic of analogue learning, she definitely deserves her happy ending à la Hollywood.

Football: Reus and Zorc demand peace for Götze
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public debate on the form and fitness of Mario Götze.
"We should stop thinking about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.

Football: District League: Researchers appearance of the VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrhein makes courage
There were moments in this still young season, when Alois Fetsch went to court with his own.
Wortkarg, the coach of the football district ligist VfL Wolbeck, first withdrew (inside) to sexist about the lack of power on the green.
All the story.
In the meantime, it's running around the Brandhoveweg again.
Baptism is the 1: 1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrhein, in the past season only hauchthin passed by the ascent.
Yeah, I'm very happy with the show.
"We have made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen, "Fetsch praised his boys and looked for the game to simply say" thank you "for so much resistance to the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him Luca Rehberg came - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly to a 4-2-3-1 where Niklas Thewes waited for balls in the front front.
Wolbeck had significantly more game shares in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his exit (17), the intertwined Luca Rehberg (26) and Jan Schroer (38) missed the lead.
This almost would have been avenged when the SCA in minute 41 was twice in person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbauer in front of the Wolbeck box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his case.
After the break, the VfL took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed.
Schroer was also late for a Thewes entry after 58 minutes.
With the change of Miles Geske, fat on the left missed another fresh cell course.
When Altenrhein's Chris Naberbeumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect release for the place lords 18 meters before the guest's house.
The fouled himself started and demonstrated his danger to standards.
Westhues "thing with the right sleep hit the bottom left from the point of view of the shooter - 1: 0 (71st).
20 minutes to get the hell long.
And then this: VfL captain Florian Quabeck, in the 80th minute, flew the leather into the prison room, unfortunately.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79th).
In the final phase, Wolbeck had to survive in a few minutes, before Geske had the victory hit in the 87th minute from 12 meters.
Maybe it would have been too much of the good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Völmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Starting position: Four points after five days of play - that could not be enough for coach Adi Hütter.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
At the time of the landing, the accident was still on the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
Around 2: 00 p.m. on Sunday at the airport in Kottingbrunn there was a drama.
There were turbulence when a helicopter was landed, as the police confirmed to oe24.
The heli was captured by a wind boar, scratched on the ground and came to the side to lay down.
The police, rescue and fire department were immediately notified.
With a great deal of effort, the forces came to the site of the accident.
The ÖAMTC emergency helicopter was also called for caution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There's only one material damage.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and could go home on their own.
The exact circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and the subject of the investigation.
According to the fire-fighting speaker Franz Resperger there was a small fire, which could, however, be deleted quickly.
Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain a rare in corporate boards
In this way, only 8% of the board of directors on the 1st of September were female, as shown in the report "The Power of Monoculture," which is officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and was before the German Press Agency.
"The companies will have to change their position, otherwise the international competitors will pass them," said Foundation CEO Wiebke Ankersen.
In the United States, Great Britain or Sweden, only male-occupied leadership teams - with a few exceptions - are far from imaginable.
The gap makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and forward-looking compared to the German competitors.
It's a different business culture.
The small increase in the share of women among the German stock exchange companies was also due only to positive incentives for the enterprises of the medium-sized value index (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8% of the board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the value was still 3.8 percent.
The 30 Dax companies - in the past few years - have stagnated the proportion of women.
26 women last worked in the board.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit more consistent women in the coming year - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have indicated that they would not continue to make a commitment to increase the share of "zero percent" so far.
Another picture is given by the Supervisory Board: on 1 September, the proportion of women was 30.5% - 45 women and 68 men less than a year ago.
"If there were as many women to be recruited every year for the board of directors, a 40% share would have been achieved by 2023," says the report.
Some even make moss: luxury carrots: which manufacturer deserves the most per car?
Ferrari deserves the best.

Who makes the most profit per car among the nobility providers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers collect per car that they sell?
This question has been addressed by "autopapst" and economic professor Ferdinand Dudenhaffer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
In the first half of the year, Ferrari made 60.000 euros of operating profit with each car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to about 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley are putting a lot of weight on it even with each car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices from an average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and about 3,000 euros win before interest and taxes EBIT.

She didn't tell her birthday date.
Torch train to the opening of the 60th Abtswinder wine festival
With a torch train, the Tourist Association in Abtswind opened its wine festival session.
For the 60th time, the association is organizing the wine festivals, which are now on the rise every Saturday in October in the big festival tent on Rehweiler Straße.
To the start of the anniversary, those responsible for the sounds of the Spielmannschreige from Wiesenbronn moved through the place to the festival.
The chairman of the Tourist Association, Wolfgang Starz, Mayor Jürgen Schulz and the wine princess Lisa Kursawe, welcomed the guests in the already propensity of the festival. "60 years of doing this - this is a great achievement for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that, "Starz thanked all the helpers.
The wine princess Lisa II later came in symbolically with the guests from the stage.
"I'm glad that so many have found the way to us again to Abtwind." Later, "The Troglauer" made for the mood.
On Sunday, on which the Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the association had set the drinks prices on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon as 60 years ago.
A feast evening at the 60th wine festival takes place on Friday, October 5, in the house of the guest before a day later in the festival tent goes into the second round.
In Bonn: Emergency car power in Taxi
An emergency car is heavily damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old passantin has been killed in the collision of the operating vehicle with a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they should help - best save people's lives.
Such a rescue took a fatal end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - At the collision of an emergency car with a taxi, a 26-year-old pedestrian was killed in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and her driver were seriously injured, as the police reported.
The 46-year-old driver of the Notorztautos had passed a red light on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then met at a junction with the taxi that was driving at Green.
After the collision, the doctor's car went into a mast of light and a tree.

Driver of the emergency car and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency car were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be released from the service.
The also severely injured 29-year-old emergency doctor was able to free himself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another called emergency doctor tried this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close coordination with the Bonn Public Prosecutor, are investigating who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we are uncomfortable
After the blamable off in the Ligacup, Manchester United is now losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
ManU is 1: 3 against West Ham United, the way of defeat is likely to give you more talk.
The scene was in the 74th minute in which the recreated Marko Arnautovic shot the 3-1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had allegedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an off-side at the Mark Nobel pass, all the defenses of Manchester stopped, and Arnautovic left all the time in the world to shoot the ball at the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative peak of an already far-reaching performance.
At the moment, the state of mind at United's city trivale Manchester City is quite different.
The citizens trained by Mourinhos major competitor Pep Guardiola came to an unthreatened 2-0 victory against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling first broke the defense bar of the outside side for the home team.
Sergio Agüero, after a good hour and a double pass with the former goalkeeper, ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also for the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer table leader
Three days after the 1-2 defeat in the Ligacup, Xherdan Shaqiri and Liverpool fought a 1-1 against Chelsea in the Premier League.
As with the Cup-Out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in the London.
The match of the 27-year-old in the 25th minute remained the only match of the game until the final phase.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the compensation after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge made it better in the 89th minute with his slender.
After the reds had started with a flawless balance sheet in the week, Chelsea was not to be beaten for the second time.
At first, the London people eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, through which the Blues Liverpool also fell from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) also celebrated 2-0 victories.
The fans of the Gunners, where Granit Xhaka played, had to wait for a success report against the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire until the 81st minute.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defenseman Craig Cathcart made an unfortunate introduction of Alex Iwobi into his own gate, and only two minutes later, Mesut Özil made the decision with his third saison.
With the fifth consecutive victory, Arsenal passed Watford and is now on the right track behind the great rival Tottenham 5. A strong impression continues to leave an ascendant Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained undefeated for the fifth time in a row at 2-0 against Southampton.
VW core brand missing: Paris car salon in the sign of the diesel debate
The Paris car salon takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no issue and yet omnipresent: The diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofitting should not let go of the German car companies even at the branch meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 car salon, they show their new features from the coming week together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel does not really play a major role in this.
The possible exchange and retrofitting offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, should still be an important issue, at least behind the shiny scenes of the trade fair stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is present with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the VW core brand itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have their first pure electric models with them: the e-tron of the Ingolstädter is to be launched at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgart 2019.
But they were both officially presented.
The iNext of BMW is not to start until 2021.
The new 3 is at the heart of Paris.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors are represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, a million visitors came.
In the severe earthquakes and the following tsunami, at least 380 people were killed on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had the strength 5,9, the second the strength 7,4.
Communication and transport links are damaged, and there was enormous damage to the environment.
After the quakes, the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu hundreds of people had gathered on the beach for a festival.
It is feared that the number of victims is still significantly higher.
The numbers have so far only come from Palu.
However, many other municipalities are also affected - along Sulawesis West Coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate divine service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service for the motorcyclists in the peace church in Eveking with a team of help on Sunday.
Werdohl - The place before the peace church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service to the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and is thus responsible for the pastoral concerns of the PS-strong two-wheel drivers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) will always take place on the last Sunday of a month at the house of Nordhelle.
The bikers are traditionally celebrating the end of the season in the peace church in Eveking.
There, about 150 bikers had come together on Sunday to do anything other than ordinary worship.
The Bolides had already been set up before the entrance of the church from 10 o'clock.
First the biker early shovels were on the program and it could be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a solid curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also involved.
During the biker service, the sermon was held by the priest Dirk Grzetorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill took care of the musical underpainting.
"Although the bikers prefer the Blues Rock, Valerie Lill is more poetic-quiet," said Father Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty yesterday in the history of the Motorcycle God Service.
Föchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates great celebration: after the apple comes the milk
And also at the actual day of action was Boric active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated to his amazing viewers step by step the process from the ripe apple to the apple juice.
Then and when did Hartmann-Niemerg leave the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the great funnel.
With a little muscle force, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children have yet been able to imagine how it should become a tasty drink.
But they could also look at this important work step on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and covered by nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemeng stacked the little-looking apple-piece layer for layer above each other.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step in the work was no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the Föchtorfer farmer also had already finished filled-in specialities.
So he opened his "treasure box" and presented the latest spring white to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Föchdorf" was so great.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents came into the conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of apple printing, but also discovered the built-up hill castle for themselves.
Active of the Föchtorfer comrade of former soldiers also engaged in the event and invited at some stations to play in two-way games.
The home club will also offer a day of action in the coming year.
Then, however, as Gregor Krützkamp stressed, the home house in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of events.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the issue: Finally, it will be around the milk.
1: 4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with the fourth season break: "Dedicated situation"
After the fourth Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around and told them courage.
There were a lot of positive things to see at the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt, however, before 1: 4 (0: 2).
"It's a fucking situation, but you have to get out of there as a team," said 96-football professional Pirmin Schwegler, and then, "This is, of course, disappointing, because you always take a lot of action."
The further unvictorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) was connected, are at the bottom with two counters and are a candidate for a descent in their current constitution.
On the other hand, led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated the first season home victory.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) reached the goals for the DFB Cup winner, who, after the successful general trial for the Europe League game against Lazio Rome, had seven points in the middle of the table.
Croatia's Vice-World Champion Rebic was involved in his launch debut in almost every dangerous offensive of the Hessen and never to get control of Hanover's defence.
The stormer, long after the World Cup, showed with his speed and power of enforcement, why he is so valuable to the struggle.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, who was loaned by Liverpool, was the first time in the early formation of the Frankfurter, which began swinging.
Lucas Torró's (17.) head ball, which was forged on the gate network, was the first to be put at risk.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped at the last moment by the 96-defense of the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the house lords fell almost inevitably and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic raised the ball after a repulsed corner in the prison room, Haller extended by head in front of the gate where Ndicka only had to hold his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga player to win the French second-ligist AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt followed before the break.
This time, Haller adapted to his storm partner Rebic, who was able to fuel himself and left 96-goalkeeper Michael Esser no chance.
In the mid-term, Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak idea of his elf and brought two new offensive forces to Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony now played a little more courageous forward, but the ideas that were lit up until the end of the year were still successful.
The Hessen were much more efficient there.
After a short hour, Rebic started a solo and then laid on De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty gate.
The rest was only a show for the Frankfurter against overcrowded guests, Jovic also met one minute before the end.
The Morlaix Square becomes a party mile
Despite cool temperatures, there was a good mood at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
The Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter made it to a million people at the opening of the 185.

Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy Cross Festival
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross Festival on September 14 or Sunday after.
The feast service takes place in the city church, then is a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Holy Cross Church houses the shot Christ, which comes from the 30-year-old war, and on which the legend is to have shot a Swedish soldier.
Then blood came out of the gunshot wound.
This led to a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not yet finished, only the old room stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Father Adolf Buhl recalls that the Cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
The service was poorly visited despite the importance for the Geisinger parish.
After the service of God, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing the ecclesiastical part of the Cross Festival ended.
For many years, the Catholic Church Choir has been invited to the Catholic parish to the secular part of the festival.
The choir members provided visitors with savoury food as well as a wide selection of cakes and weather adapted, farm holidays.
In the afternoon, the parish offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures that will continue until the next year.
After the scaffolding has been in place for some time, the damage could be identified more precisely and the individual calls for tenders prepared more specifically.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already in place a few years ago has increased, but more has been found, which was only possible by the inoculation by means of scaffolding.
The work on the base has been completed, the work on natural stone is to be started before winter, and it is hoped that half of this work will be completed this year.
Inauguration: New residence in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Donau-Iller Life Aid opens a new home for people with disabilities in the Münsterblickstraße.
That in the Münsterglickstraße now "a very special house" is handed over to its destination - as at the inauguration date all present agreed.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair drivers who have been living in the home of the Donau-Iller Life Aid for some time have been dependent on the special architecture of the new building.
The architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas.
The first plans started about eight years ago when the former U.S. Army officer building was put on the test stand for the residents with mobile phone cap: "The house had come in the years and no longer in the equipment in time," said Bader, looking back.
In 2016, the excavators started to tear down the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Life aid Danube-Iller opens new home
Around 4.6 million euros invested in life support in the new building.
The free state has contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Schwaben 450000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the works have remained in the planned framework - both in time and in financial terms.
He was also thanked by the managing director of life support, Jürgen Heinz.
The spaghetti between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-safe construction was not always easy.
However, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications that allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move without any help.
The head of the social administration of the district of Schwaben, Gertrud Kreutmayer, also said: "The house is based on the special needs of its inhabitants who need help to be mobile."
At the same time, the housing and functionality had been well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And then, "The land in this situation is a real lucky thing, because it can no longer be acquired in today's situation."
In total, the new residence in the Münsterblickstraße offers space for almost 1500 square meters for 30 people with disabilities, which are divided into three living groups.
He is proud of the 11 full-time workers who are all employed in accordance with tariff.
Germany: Swedish complains of differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the Day of Unity, the vice-president of the SPD, Manuela Schwesig, has called on all the countrymen not to deal with the disadvantage of East Germany.
There are differences that after almost 30 years of unit pain.
We must not be satisfied with these differences, "said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the" Sunday Day Games. "
The objective must remain to create a level playing field throughout the country.
It was unacceptable that East Germany on average worked longer than the people in West Germany but received 15 percent less salary.
"I can't explain this to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this puffy dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year Pungan hunting dog is to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has made the South Korean President Moon Jae a gift in two North Korean Pungan hunting dogs.
As Moon's office reported on Sunday, the two about a year old dogs reached their destination on Thursday.
They therefore passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food to facilitate the "use" of the animals.
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendship was announced by the North at the third summit this year between Moon and the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in mid-September in Pyongyang.
Both countries also agreed to join in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to compete for the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of the mutual approach, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test plant for rocket engines.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
For the 100-year anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this commemorative year, numerous new books have been published, which usually answer this question in the light of the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives, is very different in the magnificent "Bildbuch" Austria, which will be published on October 1.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to work in the field - this is the unofficial motto for the Great Coalition's working week, which is beginning today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU have not last mantratively sworn the "return to work in practice."
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashier and other working citizens in this country to the legitimate question, which is actually the difference between work and work in practice, but be it so.
If the Federal Government is now ready to rededicate itself to its mission - to government - then it should not be held up by definition debates.
The fact that the Union and the SPD can actually do something together after the provocations and blamages of the last few weeks is likely to show that Monday is already going to happen.
In the evening, the leaders of the government parties meet to the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to call this round regularly to disarm conflicts early, a lesson from all this dispute.
First of all, however, the issues of conflict are on the agenda again with the diesel retrofitting and the Trade Union Migration Act.
CSU Transport Minister Schuhe wants the car companies to get away with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to retrofit older diesel technology.
While the diesel crisis has been approaching over the weekend, the Union and the SPD are still far apart from the planned labour immigration law.
The SPD calls for a lead-limit perspective for refused asylum seekers who work or train.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "change of track" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be another fight among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not equal and equal has joined the GroKo, but three partners with some very different social structures and priorities.
It's a good fight.
Without a dispute, a society of such diverse, sometimes contradictory interests does not progress.
In order to be constructive, however, there must not be any further development of a dispute for party-active reasons on the question of being or not being.
This is still about politics, not theater.
The Union and the SPD should fight - but always have a look at the reality of people's lives.
What is feasible and useful to many?
With this key question, both the diesel and the track change question can be pragmatically clarified - and thus regain confidence.
That is why the People's Party must now fight.
Mushroom checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in charge
Does the Minister of Labour violate the applicable service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look.
"Real day and night" would have worked on the social security reform, reported an overarching social minister at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
The statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) on the list of fungi-mandatarin Daniela Holzinger is astonished - she is now bringing the matter to Parliament by request.
She assumes that "the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the use of her team and did not want to announce any violations of applicable service rights in front of running cameras."
However, it now has questions to "acquaint Har tinger of any suspicion."
Police in search of women's bodies breaks up a street
Marxgrün - Lange the police did not want to comment on this.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben is buried.
The route is still closed in the area of Marxgreen until Monday.
It was assumed that the investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, was able to finally limit the relevant place to a few meters with his guide in multiple use.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the top Bavarian monument protection authority in the area of the mentioned road section.
For more than a year now, the Public Prosecutor's Office and the Criminal Police Court have been working on the missing persons case.
A cycle path has been closed at Marxgrün and examined with sonar equipment, because the investigators suspect that the new state road could have been relocated here 30 years ago.
Colour powder and eggs: Kraalle in Barcelona before the year of Catalonia
On Monday, the controversial referendum on independence in Catalonia is the first time.
But before that, there are riots.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan Independence Reference of 1 October 2017, the centre of Barcelona has come to a conflict between separatists and the police.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the advocates of independence, among other things, by colour powder, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3000 police officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wanted to honor their colleagues who were in use last year in the election offices as an illegal referendum.
In trying to prevent citizens from voting, violence had also taken place at that time.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of separatists and central government security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
However, some of the about 6000 separatists would have tried to break the police chain by force, and the officials would have been thrown with colour bags and eggs, among other things.
Six people were arrested, 24 others were slightly injured, they were called on the authorities.
This is the first time the Independence referendum has been held on Monday.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to split up the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid put Catalonia under forced administration in the autumn of 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled to exile to Belgium.
Other politicians also went abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement remain in prison.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But the new regional president Quim Torra also insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Collected insanity: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate themselves torlos
Red-white Ahlen continues to step on the spot.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
The closing light and the third last one they unfolded before 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion as a gathered insanity.
The first half was hard to understand from the entertainment factor.
If you wanted to get a beer or a roast sausage, you could do this unworried.
There was no risk of missing a torchance, because there was practically no.
First shot after half an hour
For the first (harmless) goal of the whole game, Gütersloh's Nick Flock was responsible in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle only real - possibility had the Ahlener when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG-Torwart Frederick Westergerling to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the criminal space border.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was in an early change.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him Sinan Aygün came.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mütel from 18 meters was just above the housing and after one hour the Gütersloher appeared for the first time openly.
After a balleraberung of Matthew Wieckowicz, it went well.
The quickly presented account of Sinan Aygün "crowned Nick Flock (62.) with a low shot in the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
They also played with a head ball by Wieckowicz (66th) after a corner ball by the ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interimtrainer Angelo Daut responded, first brought Marko Onucka to Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later a Güney to Sebastian Mütel (70th).
It worked - nothing.
The Ahlener did not create more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
It was only in the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but it didn't bring anything.
Angelo Daut then tried to delete the positive: "I like that we have played zero." But unfortunately, the zero was also at the front.
"This time, we were not as dangerous as we were against wood wand, even though our opponent did not want to play here," stated RW Ahlen's interim trainer.
Offensive, "everything was a little bit" against a team that only wanted to defend.
In any case, I didn't feel like we could get a counter-gate, "said Daut.
However, as an audience, one did not feel as if his team could shoot a gate.
The idea was too poor for that.
Rekkenfelder Geertegrädmarkt: Fortunately there are enough Kreimers
This is what Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder table exhibition site for which these donations are intended.
The volunteers assure: "These donations remain in Reckenfeld as well."
At the opening the sky was shining blue, the place was still a little empty, but this should change in the course of the day.
Because, "Here it is so nice to be here, so we are here today," said a visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a proper price of humor.
For the couple Brockmann, which was supposed to be weighed up against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in the short term.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "replacement" could not be taken to entertain the increasing number of visitors in between.
This was so good that at later hours some folk songs were sung along.
"Just great," Marcel Kreimer was happy.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to place the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is pleased with the many active people with their stands, including mostly associations.
"In fact, there should be no such thing as a table," he nevertheless thanked for the action of the men's choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those who were in use at the stands and also included the other festivals held in September and the "clean up" action.
Our garden town gives itself a colorful paint - here goes something.
Then the maikranz was taken from Georg Knorr and Gerd Kraft with the help of the fire brigade and brought to the winter quarters.
Many stands were worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to heartfelt, everything was to be had.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative on his decupier saw.
Furnienwerk, beer lid with rack fields motifs and much more he had in offer.
One specialty offered three Reckenfelder beekeepers: "Reckenfelder Honey," brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Bushkliter.
The latter has another specialty.
Honey cake in the glass, of course, with honey from my own production.
That's when little Elsa had to get back in touch, so good the cake tasted.
It is the sociability that the visitors then stayed long until the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubrications with local political message: No successful advertising for skate plant
In Lengerich, unknown people have promoted the construction of a skate plant in a way that is hardly conducive.
In several places there are similar lubrications, says Jürgen Küne of the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police have filed a complaint for material damage.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark for Lengerich!" are marked on signs, among others, at the Gept-Halle and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that a corresponding writing on the advertising page at the entrance to the Gept-Bistro had already been discovered after the professional election fair on 19 September.
Since the short message was apparently left "only" with an Edding at the time, it was easily removed.
"A few days later, it was there again, sprayed up this time," said Rottmann.
It assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note is given in this case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also called on the board.
If the skate system is built, its implementation will also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already commitments, explained Jörg Hesselmann of the urban department of school, sport and culture, without mentioning names.
Well possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the smeared board.
For years, local policy and administration have been dealing with the issue of skateplant.
After the old one was dismantled at the LWL clinic, after some time the search for an alternative location began.
The Council, after all, voted in favour of the fire-fighting park.
However, this idea was not implemented - too many factors seem to have spoken against a construction at this point.
At the end of June a turning back followed.
The members of the main and financial committee have now voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Küne says to the state of the art that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning.
The last word is the City Council.
It is based on a decision this year, so that a positive vote could be built in 2019.
Air traffic control bottlenecks are getting even worse
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in summer, the German air traffic controllers see no sign of an improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm comes," said the head of the air safety union, Matthias Maas, the German press agency before the Aviation Summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
An important reason for the many delays and failures was the long-known human resources shortage in European air navigation services, for which there was no rapid solution.
"Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade union.
Europe-wide, the market for fully trained pilots was empty.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone, about a hundred people were missing to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas once again criticised the fact that various air trade unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic city, on Friday, representatives of the Federal Government, the countries, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compaction and overtime, this will not be possible without us," said the head of the GdF, who has many members in the federal German air service.
Maas once again held the EU Commission's position in charge of the Lotsen Misere.
The transport forecasts for the regulatory period up to 2019 were far too low.
The resulting costs and staff savings in national air navigation services are now fully in line with the operational business.
Maas called on Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels to ensure that the air services "do not shut down the air even further."
At present, the EU's requirements would be coordinated by 2024 and there would be a fear of further tightening.
The EU was subject to constant lobby pressure from airlines.
"Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary and his colleagues have now harvested exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," said Maas.
He hoped that the high delay costs for the airlines would lead to a rethink.
The GdF would only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Air Safety Agency (DFS) offered a "coherent training and future pact," said Maas.
The so far announced intake of 120 lottery students over the next five years is just enough to compensate for age-related departures.
The necessary staff structure is not yet connected to this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes for group conversion
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the Group's restructuring plans.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp-Interim Chief Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors at the meeting on Sunday, the Group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies should be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should not be an additional reduction in staff in addition to the already known cuts in the administration.
After two setbacks, the control body on the capital side only counts eight heads.
There are ten representatives of the employees in this respect.
However, the final decision is expected to take a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include, among other things, the 50 percent share of the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG the business is to be bundled with lifts and suppliers.
Barcelona: Violence in the demos of police and Catalan supporters of independence.
There have been violent conflicts with many injured in two parallel demonstrations by Spanish police officers and Catalan supporters of independence in Barcelona.
According to the city administration, about 3000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as about 6000 supporters of independence.
The Catalan police have tried to keep the two protests away from each other with a large offer.
According to the forces, however, the leaders of independence repeatedly tried to break the security lock.
They would have attacked the officials with paint and throw shots.
According to the information, there were also rankings between the participants in the various protest trains.
According to rescue personnel, 24 people were injured.
The police told me there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
The police had wanted to pay tribute to the colleagues who had taken action almost exactly a year ago against the election of independence in Catalonia, which was forbidden by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they called for better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel that it is unfair for Catalan and Basque police officers to make much more money than they do.
The protesters felt it was a provocation that the Spanish police demonstrated in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?," the 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez asked the news agency AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they drugged us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name with Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course we want to support our comrades who have only done their duty last year: to defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because it is a big European city and there is more echo here.
He and his colleagues, however, "did not come to provoke," the police assured.
Panne allowed access to British Minister's personal data
A security gap in a mobile phone app has led to the temporary access of the personal data of ministers and members of the conservative British Tory party to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknown people after the break was announced one day before the Tory Party Day in Birmingham.
Two people stuck on B217
On Sunday morning, the Hannover police report a serious traffic accident on the Bundesstraße 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people died driving their car against a tree.
The car is currently on fire.

Football: Juve Trainer praises by top game: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star-stormer "played the best game along with the half hour of Valencia this evening," praised Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3: 1 (1: 1) victory of the record master against the SSC Naples.
For the coach the expensive bought-in star was also the decisive man in the important game against the persecutors without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is doing well," said Allegri.
Even though we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good at our first gate - and from that moment on we have grown.
Thanks to the three goals of Ronaldo, Juve turned the game after the early backlog through the hit of Dries Mertens (10 minutes) and hung the worst perp for the time being.
The Torjäger from Real Madrid first imposed the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who made the lead with a double pack (26 / 49).
And Ronaldo, after a corner by head ball, also made the preliminary work for the hit of the head of the defense Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who only had to push in just before the gate line.
"He gives many templates," the coach praised.
But Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record goalkeeper in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We need to get even better at serving him," said the coach.
Best Juve goalkeeper is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three in the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the power of Juventus seems to be even more pressing.
Seven victories in seven games are the free series in the series A. At 21 points the master of the last seven years already has six counters lead on Naples.
The table range trained by the former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti was not without a chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the place reference of the already warned Mario Rui (58.) the top game was decided.
The Portuguese had to take up hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red from the square.
"We played well against a good Naples," said the Turin Coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel addressed.
The German national player has won Juve.
The professional from Liverpool was in use in all seven league games.
The middle field editor also played in the Champions League game against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown off the square at the 2-0 victory of the turtles and is closed for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly bizarre performance, Rapper Kanye West has paid attention to the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump was in a mineral water costume for headers and question marks among the spectators.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a change of name on time for the release of his new album.
From now on, he can only be called "Ye," according to the musician.
"The being that was formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted in response to the late singer Prince when he took his artist name.
The pseudonym, however, is not news.
The tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had explained that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I believe" Ye "is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means" you, "" says the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
I did it!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage made no sense of his disappointment.
This was a weak game of ours today.
The opponent was just more effective, we have almost never put him in trouble. "The list of Hoetmar's potential is thus thin.
Grade times two goal chances in 90 minutes, so only rarely can games be made positive.
Football-Kreisliga A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0: 2 (0: 1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two possibilities in the first passage, the first but used Maik Krause from a sharp angle to the early lead (7).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen could have increased Uphus, but after great work of Krause, he was free-standing.
The hosts only had a double possibility when Moritz Höne first failed to Torsterer Jos Schuhmacher and in the aftermath Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (61.) all gave up.
A trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved by hand on the gate line and saw red for it - also Niklas Eilmann could not use for the guests (75th).
It was only when Nils Berheide put the ball over the line that the game was decided (81.).
"We had been very critical before, that was different today than in the last few weeks," said Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, May, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Tore: 0: 1 Krause (7), 0: 2 Berheide (81).

Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacle football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3: 4
"I don't know what to think about it," he said.
"We have no access to them at all." He was supposed to mean the wing vocals with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green-white people who have a collective offensive urge.
However, he was able to laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, wrenched and pulled from his players, on the other hand, the relief was to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Well, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for the class maintenance.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was by far our best season performance," he says.
"As we come back after 0: 2, as we hold against one of the top teams of the league over the entire season, that was really phenomenal."
It is all the more bitter that you have to go home empty-handed.
Top-Torjäger Lars Zymner brought the hosts to the lead with his 12th Saisontroffer (24).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this gate.
The 2: 0 he set up on the left-hand side for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but you can't take a player like that out completely.
"This was already madness, what he did," Lewandowski unceasingly recognized the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the turn of the side, his own elf made the balance: McGill's release from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia-Torhüter Hinkerohe into the long gate (45.).
After the change of side, it was again McGill who achieved the compensation (54.).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a crunchy, action-loaded game.
Nneg shocked Albachten again (64th), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann (69th).
Despite the overnumber, Albersloh was no longer able to redirect the last Concordia hit (80.).
We must now focus our full focus on Wednesday.
"The game against Shapdets, that's what we have to win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Tore: 1: 0 Zymner (24.), 2: 0 Fröhning (39.), 2: 1 McGill (45.), 2: 2 McGill (59.), 3: 2 Nscheid (64.), 3: 3 P. Horstmann (62.), 4: 3 Yülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74th / Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg fights point against Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga-Duell between the TSV Straßberg and the FV Biberach.

Media: Dynamo Dresden's overall Bureau has resigned
The entire Bureau of the second-league football player Dynamo Dresden has resigned media reports.
In the evening, several media came up in agreement with a joint letter from the body of Saxony.
There was no confirmation of the association at first.
The reason for the withdrawal is to be internal power struggles with the former federal ligist.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
I'm glad he's gone.
There are only a few citizens whose departure in Germany makes it as much easier as those of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Three days the Turkish President was a guest in Berlin and Cologne, and many had said that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelical Academy of Tutzing: Celebrities and new offers
The Evangelical Academy of Tutzing offers about 80 meetings until the middle of next year.
At the same time, France's President Emmanuel Macron has signalled his intention to collect the tolerance price personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff the term of office was too short: as the Federal President he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
In this way, Akademie director Udo Hahn put him in charge when he proudly said, "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellor were already with us." That the Academy at the Schloss Tutzing always shows up celebrities, but was also a subject in the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, Liedermacher Konstantin Wecker takes part in a conference on spiritual experience in a philosophical perspective, and on September 29, the writer Frido Mann is at a meeting on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
In the meantime, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also promised that he will personally receive the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television host Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The around 80 meetings until mid-2019 have it in themselves.
"The pension is not safe!" is in a title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route over the Mediterranean."
"And to a meeting on Syria:" Barbarians without limit. "
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - the war defies every human idea. "
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the gap between the poor and the rich to the radical change in work through digitisation.
Akademie-Director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to find solutions or at least partial solutions."

The birthday of Karl Marx is soon expected to be one more visitors of the direction of capitalism criticism, the other more of a tendency "from the outside left to the center."
What about neutrality?
"We are 100% daughter of the Evangelical Church," said Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100% neutral."
Music cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische News
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday night in the room of the Church of Christ in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret test, Teubner's understanding of the sex was a challenge, not only with humor and warmth for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and what else there may be, but also with music.
The mini guitar used them and also master their violin.
On the wing was Ben Süverkrupp.
On the one hand, the male sparring partner, who sometimes comes to words until the end of the sentence, is a true pianist: so congenially harmoniously accompanied Süverkrupp Teubner that some may have wanted a solo.
There was also this, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, that is, the way it was to the Red thread of the evening.
Teubner had put in the game a paradox: the satisfaction of the man comes when he has a partner, but he does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not benefit.
The piano solo is now showing itself: What would have emerged from the composing of Mozart, would "the Nannerl" have opened the door unexpectedly?
Thus, Süverkrupp passes through improvisations, from Bach's "O head full of blood and wounds" to the "song of death," and from Mozart g-minor symphony to a playful dance.
There were big applause and "Bravo" from the full room.
Flowers handed over Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the club, the Chansonette.
But the president Heidemarie Markenbeck was not able to take an additional thank you.
She had the idea to give the duo next to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt also one in Wolbeck.

After a bus accident at the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police have slightly corrected the number of victims down.
There had been a slight injury to 10 passengers instead of 15 passengers.
They were all released from the hospital by now.
The French bus driver had stayed in the hospital for one night.
He was released in the course of the day, said a spokesperson to the police.
It was still unclear the cause of the accident of the bus at Bruchsal.
On Saturday morning, the bus was uninterrupted in front of a control board.
Handball: Ladies-Landesliga: Ahlener SG keeps the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Elders had problems, especially with the third-league player Carolin Stallmann, who only marked ten hits.
"Actually, I was well satisfied with the defense, only one player has made too many goals.
We didn't get them under control, "said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more upset about the many missed opportunities.
The concentration in the final stage made his team miss this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost to the end of a backlog, was at the break at 11: 12 and later at 15: 18 (45) in the back.
Only in the end did the wider bank of the hostesses become crucial.
In addition, Aydogdu placed Merle Klement on the outside of the left, which then made "extremely clever the key goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Bushkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), pump, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5 / 3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschheit (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd League Women: Top performance of the BSV East Bevern at the top of the VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball women of the BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
The Blue-White won 3: 1 at the second-league club VC Allbau Essen.
"That was a big step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the top third of the league.
This is what we have now worked out, "said Trainer Dominik Münch, looking forward to an almost impeccable performance of his team at the crashed table leader.
The guests dominated the first passage almost as much as they liked.
About 4: 1, 16: 10 and 22: 12 he went to the vice-master of the previous year at 25: 15.
Food has been accepted in the two-bar, but has not come into play.
We've been very busy with her.
Our opponent has been at high risk, but also produced a number of tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV already led at 12: 8. "Essen has changed the assumption to three-bar.
We couldn't hold the impact pressure.
Food has been sucking, and we have had a little fun, "says Münch.
At 18: 17 the volleyball women from the Ruhr area had their nose ahead for the first time.
At the 19: 24 East Bevern was still defending four of the penitentiary balls, but the fifth attempt was made to achieve its goal.
"The game was now a class better," the training leader was at the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the fact that the BSV used the sheet in the third section from 14: 16 to 25: 21.
Münch: "We played consistently and quietly."
Over 7: 3 and 15: 13 the blue-white passage brought four to their side at 25: 22.
Vera Horstmann was elected the most valuable player, but also Maren Flachmeier had an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flassmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish Community: Mosque opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticised the way in which the great Ditib mosque in Cologne was inaugurated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"In the German-Turkish relationship, the opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a heap of shrapnel that can only be brought together effortlessly," said the president of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the German editorial network.
Both the Turkish and the German sides would have missed the chance of a common, reconciling appearance.
"Instead of emphasising the membership of Muslims with Germany on the side of German leaders, Erdogan has used the date for his purposes," said Sofuoglu.
The far-reaching exclusion of the German public has "strengthened many reservations."
Home club Nottuln: offer has already established itself
After the long summer break is finally again Folktreff time.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m. the home club Nottuln is already organizing its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the room of the Old Office.
Almost on the day it is then a year ago that we first performed a Folktreff.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln, "Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottulner Home Association, is pleased.
I didn't think our Folktreff would be in Nottuln eta so fast.
No matter if Sturmtief Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the office room was always fully occupied.
"The program at the next Folktreff is, as always, a colorful mix of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, Evergreen and old battles," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who invites friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer has agreed with his accordion for the first "birthday" of the following year.
He was a member of "Gaitling," a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt, which played music with platform German texts for many years.
Now he's on his way with an Irish folk band.
The people of the Folkmeet are happy to remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz of the Folktreff Emsdetten, with his international version of the song "Frogs in the night," inspired the listeners and sent them home with an earworm.
"We expect many happy guests to spend a social and humorous evening again," it is said in the invitation of the home association.
Those who play an instrument and want to actively engage are invited to participate.
As the desired seats are always occupied quickly, it is recommended to be there in time enough.
The Folktreff starts at 7: 30, but the entrance is already at 7: 00.
China approves proposed merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking a further step forward on the way to the world's largest industrial gas company.
The Chinese competition authority had approved the proposed merger, Linde informed on Sunday.
This is still the case in South Korea and - as the largest hurdle - in the United States for the million-dollar merger.
In the last place, the chances of an insider's consent were improved because Linde has promised to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by 24 October to ensure that the merger is successful.
From pure fruit production to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stamberger-Halle, the 125-year-old existence of the district association for horticulture and land care was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with an fruit show in the Kulmbach Vereinshaus, the last building impulse for the district association for horticulture and land-care of Kulmbach was set, and exactly 125 years later, he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulmbach Stadthalle on Saturday night.
In 1893, he was raised from the Baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flassa, the "district-sobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" ("District-sobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land").
The purpose of the fruit-growing association was also different from today's work - it was actually about fruit-building, about flowers and horticulture, no one thought at that time.
"At that time, in the era of enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said the district chief Günter Dippard in his festival presentation.
Fruit trees should soak long-distance roads; in schools so-called industrial gardens were built.
It is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which have almost 7000 members.
But that does not mean that the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village decoration and nutrition play an equally important role as the transfer of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The diversity of the tasks of a horticultural association was demonstrated by the members of the Hutschdorfer youth group "Moulschwätten" on the stage.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said the district president Günter Reif, and also OB Henry Schramm stressed the importance of natural experiences for life.
The collection of chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect a similar amount of joy with Smartphone & Co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with the Councillor Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where to stand, the association decides," added Söllner, and highlighted the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district, also left no doubt to the district manager and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors through the long history of the Association and reported, among other things, the need for self-care after the war.
It used to come out of the garden, and it was put in for the winter.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the utility garden had turned into a decorative and residential garden.
"Nature has maintained, it was there before us and we have to focus on it," the expert for fruit and nut trees pleaded.
Therefore, for the horticultural associations there is an incentive not to leave behind, so that our home will remain beautiful and worth living.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens in our associations, the President of the Bavarian National Association, Wolfram Vaitl added.
"We have to stop the blatant decline in insects, which we owe to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the ceremony, which was festive surrounded by the tower glasses of the music club Thurnau.

Priority on Nafta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister is moving UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on Nafta: they put an ultimatum in both trading partners for an agreement.
Canada's Foreign Minister now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement - and moves her speech to the United Nations.
Because of the time pressure in the struggle for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the US and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of this Saturday, the Minister will not speak until Monday before the United Nations General Assembly, her spokesman told Adam Austen.
In the meantime, she is focusing on the renegotiation of Nafta.
The Mexican Minister of Economic Affairs, Ildefonso Guajardo, said on Friday that the negotiators of Canada and the US would have 48 hours to agree if Canada really wanted to join the trade agreement already reached between his country and the US.
The US and Mexico had agreed in August on a new version of the Nafta regional free trade agreement.
US President Donald Trump suggested that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
The discussions on a new edition have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they are to be completed, Trump's government wants to present the agreement to the US Senate before 1 October.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's President-in-Office, Mr Manuel López Obrador, announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.
These are the most dangerous streets in Hanover.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
The right-wing ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives, following a report by the daily "O Globo."
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform public appearances in the South American country in the last week before the presidential elections.
The politician was attacked in the early September during an election campaign in South Brazil on the open road.
Meanwhile, in several Brazilian cities, thousands of people went to the streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Not"), women's associations had called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks too, the associations against Bolsonaros made racist and anti-women statements mobile.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the São Paulo economic metropolis.
In the capital of Brasilia, the protests mixed with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to apply.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
As the former mayor of the city of São Paulo, Haddad was far behind the right-wing candidate Bolsonaro in surveys.
The "Trump of Brazil" has long been involved in policy-making, but has recently been presented as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates in the first round of the election reach the absolute majority, there will be a single election on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not be able to get out of it successfully - no matter who he is against.
Bolsonaro is known to be a referee of homosexuals and black people and to glorify the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He's always shocked with verbal derailments.
Another time he said that the supporters of Lula's left working party should be shot.
Europe is getting Ryder Cup title back
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Only one hour from Disneyland, European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairy tale in front of the gates of Paris.
The outsider team of Captain Thomas Björn, more than 150,000 spectators on the three days in the Le Golf National with great blows and outstanding team spirit, was the favorite US title defender for a toothless tiger Woods.
After long illness: Danish rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen reported on Larsen's website.
At the bed of death Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment since the beginning of the year for prostate cancer.
Larsen had become known to the band Gasolin ', which was very successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international music sizes such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the band was dissolved in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is the most sold album in Denmark.
The Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen appreciated Larsen on Sunday in a statement as "street boy," who was "against everything, but in all hearts."
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had performed on the 70th anniversary of the Danish Queen Margrethe II in 2010.
Rock night at the shoe factory: volume at the pressure air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger." Only the band names of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" suggest such a rewrite of the rocky live music experience on Saturday night in the hall of the citizens' centre of the shoe factory: Hardrick pure of three friends.
After the sound check and just before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There's no sign of a light fever.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in association with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands are very much enthusiastic about the 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
The quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika already knows how to convince the start of the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces from his own feather and the upcoming CD.
In front of the stage, the band is dancing for a consistent and busy interplay.
Although "Admission" calls are not to be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the Trio "Here We Stand."
The fact that Harrock is not the same as Harrock shows guitarist Sasha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative, sometimes reminiscent of classical rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" the "Here We Stand" also uses a synthesizer in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only does the yearning, straight-to-ballast "Take Me Home" impress by the change from melodic passages to the guitar-ridden rock reef of the multi-layered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishauschen has, however, been very familiar since its creation in 2005.
Full of agility, the band presents its hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has special stage experience with its performances in front of very large audiences - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China in 2017 - is obvious and inaudible.
In conjunction with the band, singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also sets his own accent on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 1980s.
The guitar player Norbert Brinkmann delivers an overjoyed solo for the sound that is even higher than before, while running through the audience.
A certain volume is, of course, part of a hard rock concert: the "Mint Mosquito" - Rocknacht, according to the mixed-board team, is about 98 decibel at the three-time concert of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition."
This is, for example, at the pressure-air level, but is thus still well below the "Wacken-Fesitvals," which point to the "The Ignition" on their website.
However, the Ahlenen audience does not need to be in need of an ear-numbing 120 decibels in nozzle-blue as usual in the annual metal-dike in the north of the Republic on this rock night.
After just four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky gangart have long been convinced with their sovereign, virtuous game and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone saws and sent a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups can say in the end, certainly in the transitory sense.
And above all, enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A dead man in the event of a sailplane accident at Essen / Mülheim Airport
At the airport of Mülheim / Essen there has been a fatal accident.
In a parking lot at Mülheim / Essen airport a sailing plane crashed on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred on Sunday near the airport Mülheim / Essen.
As reported by the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung," a sailplane had crashed at the exhibition park at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the flight student was on board on his own - the plane is to be a one-seater.
The plane was already on its way to the ground at the time of the accident.
The crash site is not far from a fixed site on the airport site.
But there's been an October party since this weekend.
The airport Mülheim / Essen is located on the city border of the two Ruhr cities and directly on the driveway to the 52nd motorway.
From the parking lot there is a park & ride offer at large events at the Essen fair or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump shines Kim: "And then we fell in love"
The fact that the US President of North Korea, Kim, is well-behaved despite the nuclear crisis, is not a secret.
Now, however, Trump has made a statement of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters."
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has become a new flame.
The Tragic: It is a distance relationship.
On Saturday, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to the North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un.
Before supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tenacious words for the half-old sprouts of the Pjöngjang dynasty, although it is proving to be quite serious in the struggle for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
"I was tough, so was he, and between us it went back and forth," said Trump.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the talks with Kim would have made his heart melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection also had political fruit: Trump referred to the stop of all nuclear and rocket tests announced by Kim, even though critics have so far seen little more than lip announcements.
The fact that the affection for the infamous Rocket Man, as Trump's nickname for Kim, is not likely to be every memory, seemed to be well aware of the US President.
In any case, he took the expected criticism of this at his performance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling in the first place: "Donald Trump says they have fallen in love."
How terrible, how terrible is that?
It's so unpresidential.
But he was very little concerned about this, and Trump explained, and then pointed his finger at the crowd: "I have always told you it is so easy to be a president."
But then out there, not 10,000 people would be forced into this badly filled arena, but we would have only 200 people out there.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler has visited the best, in a mood and in a way pampered by the sun: very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfestflair Baesweiler's city centre has been cleaned out on Sunday.
For the first time the Oktoberfest took place not only in the festival tent at the fire tower, but was extended to the city by the trade association on Sunday.
Refugees saved from Libyan prison video
Nigerian refugees, using a mobile video, have pointed out their disastrous conditions of detention in Libya, thus enabling them to be saved.
The group had turned the recording in its cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July under the risk of life and spread it online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers," whose editors alerted the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown to Nigeria at the end of August.
"We probably couldn't have returned to Nigeria without the video," said Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya in the attempt to get to Europe through the Mediterranean.
With the video he put himself in danger.
One of his supporters was almost beaten to death by the guards, said Onyeka.
In general, the conditions of arrest were disastrous: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their home country this year using the programme, said the IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now rescued Nigerian was not exceptional in view of the poor conditions of detention in Libya.
But he hasn't heard of a call for help by phone.
International organisations have been critical of the situation in the Libyan refugee camps for a long time.
The North African state, which is dominated to a large extent by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on the road from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At about 4: 50, the teacher entered the building over the main entrance.
In the front house of the first floor, she saw a man who fled immediately.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there through a staircase to the ground floor or the front square.
The teacher informed the police who took the investigation.
Whether things or money have been stolen cannot be said yet.
Teach description: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker look, dark pants, dark t-shirt.

German was caught in his own car for days
A 75-year-old man in a forest area in the middle of France had to stay in his car for several days and nights after he had stuck the car away from all the forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue forces accidentally discovered the car on Saturday afternoon near a meadow and released the missing persons since Tuesday night, reported the police on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was found to be in good health condition despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was looking forward to his home now.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned on Tuesday from a ride with his ground car over the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive search measures, the man's whereabouts had remained unclear for days.
Laschet appoints the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has in conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to his own state of law in Turkey.
The relations between the two countries were currently "overshadowed," said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This concerns, in particular, arrest waves, the freedom of the press and religion.
He therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalise in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this. "
According to his own information, Laschet also addressed the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He has expressed the expectation that freedom of expression will be respected.
Erdogan had again stressed the independence of Turkish justice.
The conversation of Laschet and Erdogan had been moved in the short term to a building of the flight readiness of the Federal Ministry of Defence at Cologne Airport.
Originally it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn - but the castle owners had rejected it for political conviction against Erdogan.
After the conversation, Erdogan continued to travel to the opening of the Ditib mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had canceled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go into this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contacts - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump is not tired of stressing the success of the negotiations on the denuclearisation of North Korea, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for an agreement between Washington and the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the US government of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula in the UN general debate with its continued sanctions.
"The recent standstill is therefore that the US is building on coercion measures that are deadly to confidence-building," said Ri in New York.
Disarmament was unthinkable for North Korea in these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there will be no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," the North Korean head diplomat said.
That North Korea's "knee-to-knee" punishment is "a dream of people who don't know us."
In order to build confidence, however, his country has stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed an nuclear test facility, Ri pointed out.
However, from the US side, there had been no "corresponding reactions," the Minister criticised.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile programme, the UN Security Council alone had adopted three sanctions against the internationally isolated country three times a year ago.
US President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo have in recent days called on the United Nations to ensure strict compliance with the criminal measures.
At the same time, the US government is working on an approach.
In June, Trump had first met North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US President is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October Pompeo will again be travelling to Pyongyang to discuss the end of the North Korean nuclear weapons programme.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
That they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors of the open door house HoT didn't get anything: White blankets and flower muck on the tables and a large buffet waited for the guests after the thank-you service.
The young people of the HoT had the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank for the food.
The start with the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.
We had filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then the first day after the summer break came the bad surprise: a power failure had put the huge, two-part fridge out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again from the beginning: we have received a great deal of support from friends and neighbours, but the children and young people wanted to make it by themselves," Westbuer said.
And that's how they all took it.
The result could be seen, the guests were thrilled.
"It is better not to cook," a visitor praised, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to use quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It is really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," said Father Frank Beckmann, while the magicians Stephan Lammen with card tricks and other pieces of art made him astonished.
Jürgen Sator leaves the national board of directors NRW of the board
Out of frustration about criticism from its own ranks, the head of the dining table, Jörg Sartor, has given up his post in the national association.
Sartor had become widely known because the Essen Table had introduced a reception stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as vice-chief of the NRW tables, said Sartor of the "World on Sunday."
Too many of them fell in my back.
The head of the National Tape Association NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswich, expressed an understanding of the dpa for the decision of his long-standing deputy.
The sharp criticism was taken with Sartor.
"I can understand his step - people who didn't know exactly why the dining table did it."
However, Sartor is still active in the dining table - "six days a week, there is no change," says Weilerswich.
In the "World on Sunday," Sartor again criticised colleagues from other tables.
One should not follow the approach "without us the people in the city are starving."
It was the responsibility of the state to ensure that people did not starve.
At a conference of the tables on Friday in Berlin, the dinner did not take part.
"I'm told too much sweet dirt," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis who were so critical of me at the time.
SF Lorch play 2: 0 tour - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, district league Lorch loses against Neuler 2: 3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after the fall - Bettringen clearly beats Lauchheim.
At 2: 0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against the TV Neuler - at the end it was 2: 3 and the disappointment among the sports friends was great.
The TV Heuchlingen: In Kirchheim, the TVH quickly hit the rear with 0: 1, but after 90 minutes it won with 2: 1. At the top of the table, the SGB was able to win with a 3: 0
Gladbach plays two-time lead - Schalke without Embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach must continue to wait for a win in Wolfsburg.
At 2: 2, the foals lose a lead twice.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
(sda) Four times, Schalke has maneuvered in the first five league games with early countertower in the absence.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco once again showed the strength with which it had won the first place behind the Bavaria in the last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home quipe in the eleventh minute after a strong preparatory work by Evgeni Konopljanka per head, as a result the hosts preserved the mini-pole with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund greets again from the top of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre had negotiated a 0-2 backlog against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but in the second half came to the 4-2 victory.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) compared with a Doublette within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, with another Doublette in the final phase (86th / 94th) for the crowning completion of the performance increase after the break.

As a result of a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic, the Werder Bremen had to be afraid in the meantime, even before the break.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive Goalie Ron-Robert Goeler produced a curiosities-of-their-own gate, which helped the guests to compensate in the 68th minute.

In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not have a fully successful, but also a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbacher, who appeared with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, gave twice a lead, played 2: 2 in the end and are still waiting for a win in the VW city since 2003.

At the flat shot from 20 meters of the Aargauer, Yann Sommer was powerless, as was the second match after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite promising.
In the storm of the foals, Alassane Pléa appears to be a goalgetter.
The French record purchase of the OTC Nice came in against Wolfsburg for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in a seventh mandatory game.
After seven rounds Gladbach takes fourth place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeaten Werder Bremen turned against the VfB Stuttgart into an uncomfortable location.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart account that the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis completed with his first saison event, and after 36 minutes, Milos Veljkovic continued to join his team: the 23-year-old Serbe caged after a triot sacrifice against Daniel Didavi Yellow-Red.
Although Stuttgart's defender Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Goeler brought the Bremer back to the game by a curious-bodied-own gate (68th), a quarter of an hour before the end, Gonzalo Castro shot the overnumber of Stuttgart-bodied men back to the winning road.
Nürnberg decided the duel against Düsseldorf 3: 0 sovereign.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens brought the home team on course with Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia today, some 1.8 million citizens are voting on whether to change their country's name in North Macedonia.
In the case of a yes, the almost three decades of fading conflict with the neighbour Greece could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on a change of name because of its province of the same name and blocked any approach of Macedonia to the West.
The voters therefore also decide on the future Western integration.
The US had announced that the country could become a member of NATO in the event of a positive outcome of the referendum.
Syrer in U-prison.
The refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat up three pensionists and, in part, severely injured them.
The 41-year-old asylum-seeker had landed on Friday around 10: 00 in the escape road in Alsergrund.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who went out on passers with the fists and tried to attack them on his behavior.
The Syrians then tried to beat and kick the officials.
A little later, it turned out that the suspect had just hit three older ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists at a tram stop in Zöringer Straße.
He had also kicked the trio with his feet.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They had hematomas, bruises and concussion.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for still unknown cause," as the police said.
He was put into the hospital and monitored throughout the course of treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday in Hamburg, the two gave themselves the word "yes."
A registered life partnership had not been eligible for them, Kahre had previously said the "picture" newspaper.
"If we get married, he'll be right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahr is the budgetary spokesman of the SPD-Bundestag Group and one of the speakers of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of the marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had aroused an outrage on 30 June 2017.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the subject.
"This was your Schabovski moment," he said in an allusion to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabovski.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples have been able to marry just like heterosexuals.
They had previously been able to register their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the right of adoption.
Garden day: 400 meters of hedges cut
It was a lot of work in front of the members of the citizens' association Kinderhaus and the Society for Lepractice.
For about 400 meters of hedges around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfündnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the inhabitants, about 12 supporters went to work.
"We do this to reduce costs," said the Chairman of the Civil Society Walter Schröer.
And there's a lot of things going on.
Because of the hot summer, we're late this time, but fortunately, it's just a cut.
Because already in the spring the hedges have been shaved before.
The following breakfast always on work has also been a long tradition.
"All of them should remain in power," said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner takes gold at the Kanuslalom World Cup
The Augsburg Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the end of the Canuslalom World Cup in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old made a perfect run on Sunday on the Olympia route.
Two years ago, he had missed the Olympia Bronze by three hundred seconds.
I was well prepared, had enough trips here on the plant and it was all right today, "said the Olympic third of London 2012.
In the goal he threw away his paddle with joy and stretched both arms more victorious to the height - knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had start number four.
But the six remaining starters could not top up his fabulous time of 89.69 seconds.
The second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec in front of the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The Gauthing police inspection reports the first attempt at this fall in a family house.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - that's what burglars want to make use of.
So yesterday the police inspection Gauthing reported the first attempt at the fall.
The alarm system is due to the fact that it remained at the one-family house on the Königswieser Straße in the attempt.
It went off when the perpetrators put on hand just before 8: 00 on Friday.
The burglars knew that the residents were not at home.
The alarm system surprised them, however, to such a extent that they took the escape without prey.
Notes to PI Gauthing, telephone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Pleite at Hertha: The reality of the situation: Bavaria demanded against Ajax
The preacher is unbeatable: the defeat in Berlin does not want to "let the FC Bayern fall."
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first intermediate phase for the term of office of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance models under the new Coach Niko Kovac should not, in any case, increase to the larger autumn depth for the Münchner.
"A week ago, we had the impression that we were invincible.
Now a little bit of reality has come to us, "Thomas Müller stated after the 0-2 defeat at Hertha BSC and called for a response for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
If you know us, you know that this really annoys us and that's why we're heading for Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, no own goal has been shot out, as at the same time of the pre-season two mandatory games in series without victory, the table leadership in the Bundesliga for the time being lost to Borussia Dortmund.
The overall situation is not as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, but the record master must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1: 1 with its running-intensive man-to-man tactics and the Berlin through their playful needle stitches over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, as the most powerful Bavaria appear to be to be cracked.
"Those who know the FC Bayern know that we do not like this and we will do everything we can to succeed again," said Kovac.
Otherwise, however, he went with his losers in his hometown surprisingly gently and pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach only to the once again poor handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would still make the first part of his term of office positive before the country's play break - otherwise the tone is likely to get worse.
Kovac did not take any exceptional measures at Benfica Lisbon before the second royal class performance this season after 2: 0.
After the day off on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second pre-run game against Ajax, which had also made the start of AEK Athens sovereign with 3: 0.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will also make our goals again," announced National Team Captain Manuel Neuer.
As already after the lost Cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke clearly.
The legal defender appeared in the role as a warner.
"I don't think that this is all bad luck, we have to work it out again, because we don't make the many chances and make the mistakes behind it," said the 23-year-old just before the departure from the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bavaria were already behind Dortmund with five counters, which has now taken the lead again with a point lead.
And so Kimmich, with an eye wink, was at least positive that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now come to an end.
"Yes, that's a good thing," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in line of fire: Özil-Causa: sharp attack by Erdogan an Grindel
With heavy accusations, Turkish President Erdogan denies the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
Although DFB President Grindel sees a mistake, he defends the line of association.
Now a new item is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the degree of interpretation in the long-term dispute theme Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President, at the opening of the great Ditib mosque in Cologne, strongly criticised the handling of the former world champion in Germany, the DFB leader defended the line of association.
In the early Sunday morning, the Grindel, personally hit by Özil, announced the consequences of the Causa in the main ZDF "sports studio."
"In the future, because we also have many players with a migration background in the U-teams, we have to draw very precise conclusions that this is not repeated," said the 57-year-old, and wants to win a national player without a migration background as a further integration representative.
At the same time, Grindel again stated that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had strongly denounced racism against Ozil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German-born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They have excluded them from this society because they were photographed with me in England, "said Erdogan on Saturday in the Domstadt.
To be honest, as their President, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who have risen to the German national team, have been excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, in contrast to Özil after the World Cup affair, which had started with Erdogan, he felt "treated rationally by the DFB."
At the same time, he announced that he would want to face players in the future.
That someone says, if I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm a migrant - I can't.
"I am very sorry that he has such an impression," said Grindel.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said that.
But he does not see a basis for a return of Özil to the national team either.
In addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration representative is now to be appointed.
"If one of them has a clear impact on society and football without a migration background, and says," The issue is important, we have to take care of it, "that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local associations, where integration must work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he will again be running for the office as DFB President in the coming year.
"I do my job and I try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel.
The year is building three accidents within three hours
Coburg / Rödental - As the police report, the 75-year-old has caused the accidents on Friday between 10: 00 and 1: 00.
The 75-year-old driver was first addressed by a lady at the red light in the area of Lauterer Höhe.
She told the pensioner that he had driven against her car.
There was no exchange of staff, however, because the 75-year-old couldn't find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a driver who would have come off the road and driven against a lead post.
Speaking of which, the man didn't want a police on the ground and then drove away.
Then the Rödentaler went home.
However, the pensioner in his place of residence, where he has been living for decades, has acted and a construction vehicle has been rammed when he turns.
After all, the police could find him and stop him.
His car had significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a crazy impression and could not remember much more.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moorfire in Meppen: Almost 1000 forces are still in use.
Around four weeks after the outbreak of the Moorfire on a federal defence site in the Emsland, 980 forces are still working on the extinguishing work.
The Bundeswehr reported this on Sunday.
As the situation continues to develop stable according to a speaker, 70 volunteers were last withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of forces was planned, it is said.
On the night of Sunday an upper-earth fire had been discovered and deleted.
Last week the disaster had been lifted, which was announced a week before on September 21, because it was feared that the flames would put adjacent forests and settlements at risk by wind and spark.
On Thursday it was then said that an attack of the fire on adjacent communities is no longer threatening.
In time, more than 1500 forces tried to control the large fire on the ground.
The Luftwaffe further supports the work on the German military test site at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones of the Bundeswehr.
According to the Bundeswehr, "Tornados" is also planned for October 2 and 5.
The fire was triggered by the test chains that fired Airbus technicians.
The smoke fire of the Moorbrand had moved up to a hundred kilometres far beyond the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point that will receive damage reports.
First claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after her wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the politician married his long-standing friend in Hamburg.
They've been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday in Hamburg, the two gave themselves the word "yes."
A registered life partnership had not been eligible for them, Kahre had previously said the "picture" newspaper.
If we get married, it's right.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahr is the budgetary spokesman of the SPD-Bundestag Group and one of the speakers of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of the marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had aroused an outrage on 30 June 2017.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the subject.
"This was your Schabovski moment," he said in an allusion to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabovski.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples have been able to marry just like heterosexuals.
They had previously been able to register their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the right of adoption.
Referendum in Macedonia on new state names started
In Macedonia, the highly expected referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Some 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is because of its northern province of the neighbouring Greece.
As a means of pressure, Athens had for almost three decades blocked any approach from Skopje to the EU and NATO.
If the citizens vote yes, they will also give the start to their country's Western integration.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from forgetting
The Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have become 90 years old on September 30.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner dies in the United States in 2016 and leaves a work that conserves the horrors of the Shoah for the Middle World.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve members of the family in stress situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that institutions may continue to be taken only with express consent, stresses Swiss plant.
(dpa) Switzerland is starting an electronic register of organ donors this Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stress situations.
People who wish to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes are then available in case of need of Swiss plant.
The new procedure does not change the fact that institutions can continue to be taken away with express consent, as in Germany, stresses Swiss plant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Emer, director of the Swiss plant Foundation.
But only five percent of the cases will a card be found at the crucial moment at possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the talks, the relatives do not know the wish of the deceased.
"You will then have to decide, in the sense of the deceased, what is often very burdensome," said Always.
There is a similar registration system in the United Kingdom.
In Germany there are considerations to store information on the possible organ donation on the health card, as the speaker of the Federal Health Education Centre says, Marita Völker-Albert.
"A register in which people can register their wishes - per or contra organ donation - does not exist," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has expressed his support for a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would first be considered an organ donor, unless he or she were opposed.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is the world champion in the head
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is the world champion in the head.
He won the weekend in Wolfsburg against 39 members.
Martina Flamme-Jasper of the science museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition, reported this on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Greiss from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a 12-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old French retired, as the main arbitrator Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
To date, for example: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
As the audience were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, where participants came up against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel's greetings from Lastrup demonstrated how he keeps a ball with his head in the air when calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Greetings was present two years ago as a 14-year-old in Bielefeld.
With terms such as superbrain, genius or miracle child, organizer Laue can not start much.
"Head-to-head can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, even in stages, there are computational competitions.
The disciplines include, for example, the square root drawing from six-digit numbers.
In the case of versatility, the candidates are given surprise tasks, for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
Here too, the Germans would have good chances, said the main arbitrator.
Otherwise, Asian people are often in favour, because there is a more intensive and effective way of coping in the early childhood.
Impressive appeal: Video with naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer early detection
Tennis-Ass Serena Williams shows up from her sensitive and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to point to breast cancer with this video and make himself strong for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings at the top without the song "I Touch Myself" by the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover her most intimate places.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died of it.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which deals with early breast cancer recognition, which can save life.
Serena Williams would have died almost a year ago.
At the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia there were complications.
An emergency surgery was launched to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT, blood lumps were then discovered in Serena's lung.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government is planning a significant extension of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the Turkish-blue coalition will send an appropriate draft law to the so-called "symbol law" in review.
This will significantly increase the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings new snow to the mountains in the west
Mrs Holle will be shaking out her beds in the West for the first time next week: Polish cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the Meteorologists of the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snow fall to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys it could snow down to about 1,000 meters, it was said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern above 2,000 meters is to be expected with 20 to 40 centimeters of fresh snow.
On higher roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlopass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions become winter.
Farmers are allowed to start on Monday with the annual kickcare
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start their annual kickcare on Monday.
The "green walls" which are unique in Germany for about 200 years have been the landscape of the forest-bohemian state.
The up to five meters wide tree and tights are "forest set" and for many animals and plants the last retreat rooms.
Knicks connect, as a corridor scattered, habitats through which the exchange of organisms can still work, as the managing director of the Germany Nature Conservation Federation (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski said.
Kicks are living fences
The Knicks were created on the basis of a command of the Danish King Christian VI in 1766, who ruled Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limits and livestock fences, they also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their specialized workshops.
From that time on, his name is also "Knick": the dense, interlinked boundaries were developed by "cutting the branches."
Today, between the North and the Baltic Sea, about 45 000 kilometres of the hedges are covered and give the picture of a wooded, diverse-structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used by some 7000 species as a replacement habitat.
In one kilometer of Kick, up to 1800 different species could live and breed up to 30 bird pairs.
However, its ecologically important function can only be achieved by the Knick if it is maintained in winter.
Otherwise, he takes care of a light tree series, which, in addition to biodiversity, also reduces the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the kickcare can only be operated outside the breeding period from October to March.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesia talks about on-site SITUATION
In an interview with the German editorial network (RND), the local radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you on the ground during the Tsunamis?
No, I was in Jakarta right now on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I found out about the tsunami, I immediately went back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, because the airport on Palu was closed at that time.
What's the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that it can also fly in aid.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast that are all completely destroyed.
Our "World Vision" office is also destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have run on the surrounding hills, where they are still waiting for fear of another tsunami and earthquakes and where they have no access to water and food.
Some of them are in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many food shops and also the gas stations are completely closed, people sometimes steal food and petrol.
The public service has gone down completely, the national government is helping out.
A prison was also destroyed, the prisoners are partly free and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not been found and are missing.
How is communication and information on the island going?
At the moment we have cell phone reception, but before that, it didn't work and we only got information on the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbours and other people who do not know if they are alive and where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but for example at work.
The tsunami warning system didn't work properly.
Do you have any information?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought "okay, not tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami met the region and they ran on the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi on the Pacific fire ring not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injury to become: VfB has to give up on Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing from the VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
At the 2: 1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, Aogo had drawn a muscle fibre tear in the back left thigh, the football-Bundesligist reported on Sunday.
In Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle joint fracture in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss games even after the following country game break.
The VfB Stuttgart did not provide a forecast at the time of failure.
A muscle joint rupture usually heals up within six to eight weeks, a muscle fibre rupture usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - The film festival of San Sebastián closes annually the ripening of the most prestigious European festivals.
Despite all the singing on the cinema, it can be said that 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, especially with strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a Venice, which was able to attract a lot of attention with Oscar candidates from Hollywood, San Sebastian also made one of his best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning, the fire department Olching tried to catch an injured duck.
The action, however, took some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - Walkers at the Olchinger See noticed a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She was in the area of the water station.
To help the animal, the passers called the police and the fire department.
However, the first attempts to catch the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to evade the forces over and over again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade was able to circle the animal and push it back to land, where it was then put into a transport box after almost an hour by a fireman with a held handle.
The duck that was injured at the chest was then taken to the LMU's animal clinic to Oberschleißheim.
But according to the first estimates, their chances of survival are rather low.

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at the Turbotempo
The time is extremely short and the number of planned interviews is very limited.
With an FBI investigation at the Turbotempo, the Republicans in the US Senate are trying to secure the very thin majority for the judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is in dispute for the need for a trial.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline for the investigators until Friday to clarify the alleged incidents over 30 years ago.
The recent turn in the drama around the call of Kavanaughs accompanied by a cultural struggle had been launched on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in the course of which the jurist gave rise to angry tyrants against the opposition democrats, the Senate's Justice Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the Erzconservative Judge at the Supreme Court of the United States.
The majority of Republicans seemed secure when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake said, contrary to his original announcement, that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After a two-way scene, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had referred to the serious demonstrations on Thursday as a "shat," initially contained further attacks against women and spoke on the contrary of "happiness in the bad luck."
That way, he said, final doubts could be removed.
Later, Trump attacked the Democrats in an election rally because they rejected Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy."
Trump is ordering FBI investigation in the Kavanaugh case
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of the investigators.
You will investigate the well-known allegations of two women, that's all, a government representative said to the Wall Street Journal: "They're not going on a fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
The mobile radar device installed in a "civil vehicle" of the municipality of Ried for the monitoring of the temporary policy is stationed on the garden road as of Monday, October 1.
There is also the Federal School Center.
The municipality also operates a number of fixed-installed wheel-oxides.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You felt the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season victory against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first season win.
However, the factor of time also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - In the meantime, it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football games.
That was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our prison room, "said the sports board of Schalke 04 - and breathed up.
After all, the King's blue still managed to bring the short 1: 0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first season victory under the roof and branch.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the leadership by Alessandro Schöpf 11 of the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco had given security, Tedesco: "In sum, the first half was good, both playful and from the press," apparently more and more of the head played with increasing playing time.
Don't actually create a headball monster
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," said Heidel: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bank, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to get this out of their hands and therefore keep moving back.
And with man and mouse defended against Mainz.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We all fell a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who with his head ball hit had no insignificant share in it: "I am actually the worst head ball player in the man-making world."
But in the end, only the victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start busy in the initial phase and make a fireworks out of it," said Schalkes Chefcoach.
The victory was important.
At last we can enjoy ourselves for a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligent, quiet and brave, so we have to go to games for more than 90 minutes
The biggest manko of the afternoon: King's blue missed to make it more clear.
The possibilities were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpanyanka, who met the latte twice 59th / 72nd or Amine Harit 63.
"Then it would not have become a tremor," Tedesco said, "You've already felt the fear a little bit."
That's why I'm glad we won.
He wasn't the only shalker.
Fishbachau: smoke column visible in the central valley 2 km
The smoke was not to be overlooked.
From about two kilometres away, a hiker in the main hall observed a fire on Sunday around 1.30.
Now the police are investigating.
Fishbachau - The cause soon found out police and fire brigade: an unknown had lit garbage on a two-square-metre area on the Gschwendner mountain.
According to the police, it seemed as if he had been monitoring the fire for a long time, but then left the gluten unsupervised.
And that's near the forest.
30 fish bachauer firefighters were busy with the fight and the deletion.
The police are investigating for arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladdin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at an eye level
The author is in front of them, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has followed for the time being the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hausschild.
"It has been my task for many years to bring interesting people to good shape," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Meeting" - the association that cooperates with the Alliance "Cultural Policy" in the course of the evening.
El-Mafaalani goes to the reading very easily, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject.
With a lot of gestures, fixed numbers and some kind of joke, he brings the audience closer to one of the most conflict-rich themes: migration and integration.
Why are there increasingly conflicts in spite of successful integration?
The syrical author is used to answer the question of a metaphor.
The German society is sitting at a table, the first-generation migrants are on the Katzentich.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to get to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they were always sitting at the big table and now want to be part of the decision.
This leads to conflicts.
It is therefore important not to set up a political right or a left, but to say, "Am I in favour of or against an open society?," he stresses.
The discussion is starting to take place at the beginning, and then the discussion is starting to get worse and worse.
And there is a need to speak.
A Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani is in front of it, not on stage, an image of the discussion: it is at eye level.
The sociology professor does not express his opinion, stresses that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in this issue, because "only if we understand what the problem is can we find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
During the following signing hour he has also been an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, in the case of prepared Kurdish specialities, in an intensive discussion.
Basketball: Bonn and Giessen win start-up games
The Giessen 46ers and the Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first day of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and a foreign win.
Gießen was in a hard-fought game in his own hall with 91: 84 (43: 46) against the Central German BC.
The ambitious Bonner won the BG Göttingen at 86: 79 (49: 47).
The first table leader of the season is Alba Berlin after the 112: 55-Gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
At the beginning of the new season, the German masters Bayern Munich and the former serial master Brose Bamberg had much more difficulty.
Munich was already working on Friday for a 83: 77 at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg at 84: 80 on Saturday.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 land
The need is obviously huge: more than 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the land in Landsham-South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first land in the new building area of Landsham-Süd on the free market.
That's what Mayor Roland Frick says.
In addition, the application phase for the 20 land that the municipality offers on more favourable conditions or prices is completed - similar to the previous local model.
A good 100 applications had been received, said Frick.
"The documents are currently being examined," as regards the application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the Plieninger Mayor, the aim is to have the candidate ranking set up by the end of the year for the 20 land and to present it to the municipal council.
The award could then be made.
A total of 50 land is created on the area in the south of Landsham for single and double houses as well as four land for multi-family houses with an estimated eight residential units.
The development is now almost complete, and the roads and roads will soon be paved.
A single property as well as two of the multi-family houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells most of the land on the free market, 20 land in the socially compatible model.
According to Frick, the two multi-family houses of the municipality are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 free-state-funded, income-oriented apartments.
Space for 200 people
The area of the new area of Landsham-Süd is roughly estimated to be created for about 200 people.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, the start of the new building of a children's day place is done there, according to Frick.
It will include three kindergarten and three crib groups and a multi-purpose space.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next year of kindergarten.
So Schalkes Naldo "great sport" also succeeds on the bank
For the third time in a row, not in a start: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks to Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After the third consecutive time Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had not been in the Schalker Startelf, but sat on the exchange bank, the understanding would have been great for many people if the Brazilian almost two-metre-tall had spoken to the peace of the soul.
But after the 1-0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05, as usual, the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle and thanked Domenico Tedesco for all his professionals, the 36-year-old, who all call Naldo for simplicity, turned in and said, "We have to thank, coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," said Tedesco later on about the reaction to his vice-captain, who, despite his renewed reserve-existence, had no grudge.
Probably Naldo, who was celebrated as the best chancellor in the last season, knows that he actually did not get on the track with his coach - but is given a break for good reasons.
A reason called "load control."
It wasn't easy to tell him that.
"It was not easy to tell him that, I tell you quite honestly," Tedesco reported about the moment he said Naldo was not in the start.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the club, "Tedesco founded the step.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bavaria and Porto.
He's 36 years old.
It is important that at the moment everyone can get through.
And that we all keep in the boat, "Tedesco explained the rotation, which last caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also showing himself on the bank as an exemplary team player.
The mood in Austria's industry has continued to grow faster than in the eurozone in August.
The shopping manager index (PMI) was 46.7 points at a 37-month level.
However, in Europe, Austria has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute reported on Monday to its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, while the PMI of the euro area increased by 1.1 to 45.1 points, the index is still the 13th consecutive month below the mark of 50 meters, which indicates growth.
The only Irish industry to break this threshold was in August with 50.9 points.
The final light was the Greek (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain the mood barometer fell, but it was slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level since March, with 44.0 points.
"The slightly weakened valley trip could mean that the worst is over," said Marit-economist Rob Dobson.
But industry - in any case in the third quarter - remains the growth brake number one.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the euro area have not fallen as much as since November 2011.
The companies therefore dismantled the seventh month in a row.
In China, too, industrial production fell more than initially assumed in August.
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Manager Code is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, developments in turnover, employment, storage and prices are being raised.
Tuchel's PSG team succeeds behind victory in the eighth league game
29 September 2018 at 19: 45
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel continues to hasten with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship from victory to victory.
At the OTC Nice, the title defender won 3: 0 (1: 0) with two hits from Superstar Neymar and was also successful in the eighth league game.
The last time Olympique Lyon was in France, 82 years ago, was such a good start to the season.
The Brazilian Neymar led PSG after 22 minutes and produced the end of the season.
