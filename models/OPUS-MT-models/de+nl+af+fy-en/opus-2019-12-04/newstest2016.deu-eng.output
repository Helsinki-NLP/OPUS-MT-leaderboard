Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Tehran's destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
The meeting will also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticises the ongoing settlement of Israel and inspires Netanyahu's lack of will in the peace process.
The deal of the Iranian nuclear programme, which Obama has called for, has further exacerbated the relationship between the two.
In March, at the invitation of the Republicans, Netanyahu had made a controversial speech before the US Congress, which was partly considered an affront to Obama.
The speech had not been agreed with Obama, a meeting with reference to the election to be held in Israel at the time.
In an emergency call, Professor confessed to shooting his girlfriend.
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to stress that his "sweet dog" is still alive and probably excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Within the house, the officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was scratched on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to make it back, I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me." This was according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no evidence that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already travelled 300 miles to the school area, where according to the police, he had shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10: 18.
He said that Lamb made the disastrous emergency call at some point after that.
Until the end of the day, there was another death: Lamb took his life when the police confiscated him.
One day after the shooting at the university, the students and lecturers forced them to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who knew him said, helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his class.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he has no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose teachers include 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies to problematic behaviour.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm told him that at the end of the academic year 2014-15 he had to deal with stress.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University to leave for health reasons, saying that he had some kind of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
The latest changes in the University's employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard would not guarantee an automatic way of becoming an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's performance."
These are questions that Lamb can't answer anymore.
After the escape from the campus, the police later found Lamb's trail when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the back of a house about a mile south of his parents' house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said that she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the University in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of the long-standing friends of Lambs called him intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met with friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar game for a few years.
He was the woman's black at the time.
All the girls melt when he was there, "said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburbs of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no document of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was completely destroyed," said O'Steen about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed on a summer market three years ago.
Later, they played one or the other gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julip Room, a light-lit bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of September 5 for the last time after Lamb finished his guitar and harmonica game in front of a sparse audience.
There was no evidence that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and kidding each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of joke.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first-semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and the student committee.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including lecturers, staff, students and members of the community, participated in a candlelight memorial.
His brother Jeff Schmidt and his wife, Liz, also took part in the memorial watch, while the university choir "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" sang.
The lessons will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We are trying to move our students back," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a Day of Healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press authors Emily Wadster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt, and that Lamb, in his emergency call, called Prentiss his wife, but there is no indication that the two of them have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire less labour for Christmas time
Toys R Us says that there will not be as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toy and baby product dealer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it was planning to hire 40,000 people in shops and sales centres all over the country. In the Christmas season 2014, 45,000 workers were still employed.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that this month it will start with applications and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays are still months away, the Christmas business is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to provide shops with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theatre waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and I am beginning to realize that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary film "Back in Time."
The film begins, and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated yam and an army length away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date.
"Back in Time," a documentary about "Back to the Future," presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemecki and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had the premiere 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," said Spielberg, "the biggest time travel movie ever made."
"Back in Time" will be shown on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" to the almost five-year conflict, and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN Chief once again calls on all parties, including the shared UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he is planning to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent members of the Council - USA, Russia, China, Great Britain and France - on the margins of the General Assembly's ministerial meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "made this situation unsolvable."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they have shown in the process of achieving a nuclear deal with Iran in dealing with the crisis in Syria.
8 survey values that show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others have taken him off as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the upper ranks at polls down, it has not yet worked.
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump in the two-digit area, and some are starting to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate moguls.
It is, of course, too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry's leadership was given to the ascending Herman Cain, of which no one won even one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general choice.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's perseverance and start to let their dollars flow to overthrow him.
Here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity has turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey by Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positive.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these figures are in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a survey by CNN / ORC last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either "excited" or "satisfied" if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they're "upset" if he's the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they're "excited" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next one in enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say that they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
A majority of Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticised for his bombistic and offensive statements, 52 percent of the Irish voters who become the Republicans believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperature for a president, ABC News / Washington Post says on Monday.
The same number applies in the first pre-election state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to perform his duties effectively, and almost six out of 10 independent people say that his temperament does not fit into the White House, says ABC / Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they put on their scholars' hats, Republican voters think trump is real.
If they are asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, after a survey by CNN / ORC last week, four out of ten say that Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since when four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the most clear crystal ball in the past.
At that time in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination against only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
However, a large number of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans were gathering for another candidate, Trump is still beating almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey by Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump will reap the majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, in front of Marco Rubio 14 points, in front of Walker 15 points, in front of Jeb Bush 19 points and finally in front of Rand Paul, John Kaisich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to hit him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A small majority of Donald Trump fans say they made up their mind.
A new survey by CBS / NYT on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Trump say that they have given their votes firmly.
Of course, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say never to change their mind.
46 percent said they left the door open to change to other candidates.
However, Trump's strongest competition is at the moment of the other outsiders, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say that they have formed their opinion are twice as often for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump in his campaign speech two months ago called immigrants from Mexico "rapist," immigration has been the focus of the public discourse on 2016.
Some are concerned that the bombistic expression of Trump will keep crucial Hispanic Americans away from the Republican Party and will damage the reorientation efforts.
But after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will apparently do it.
The frustration about the government is climbing to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half of the support of Republican voters, especially through their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new ABC / Post Monday survey that they prefer a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they're also angry at Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated about the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "furious."
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea Watt.
In the street, a square meter of a Reetdachhaus costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"The offer of objects is, of course, limited to Sylt," says the study - that is why the high price.
A new study shows in which special layers one square metre costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student house in Munich are not really little.
In contrast to Germany's top-level residents, one of the prices is like peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meters prices in staggering heights.
There are once several tens of thousands of euros - per square metre, well noticed.
Well, well, whoever can afford it...
By the way: Munich is, for the time being, not at the top.
Champions League: Bayern-Dreamstart thanks to Müller and Götze
Two goals in Piraeus: Bayern-Star Thomas Müller has just one run.
A happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way to the FC Bayern to a earned 3-0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it ran.
A sovereign start of the Champions League season.
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given the FC Bayern a dream start to the "Mission Milan" in the Witenkessel of Piraeus.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their first game in the Champions League with the Greek record champion Olympiakos in hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52nd / 90. + 2) and Götze's score (89th) earned 3: 0 (0: 0).
The 12th start-up success in series is to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola will finally get the hankpot to Munich in the third run.
In his 28th match in the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership, Müller was given the help of Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto, who made one happen as a flank shot of the world master.
"We will not underestimate them," had Bayern Captain Philipp Lahm promised before the game in the Karaiskakis stadium before 31.688 hot-blooded fans - and the Münchner kept the word.
They showed a focused and committed idea without gloss.
Piraeus had won his last six home games in the royal class, including against famous clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011 Borussia Dortmund also stumbled here (1: 3).
But Bavaria, undefeated in seven European duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They were courageous, but often too unimaginable to work in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were too often initiated by a shift to the outside of the left, Douglas Costa, who was rarely made against the former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller was more lucky from the right than his flank from the right half-field in the upper left corner.
In the 67th minute the world champion gave away the possible 2: 0.
The best opportunities in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiakos-Stürmer Ideye Brown hit the head ball of Poland off the line (26).
Then by direct removal, the goalkeeper Roberto parted with the knee (35.).
Although the Bavaria used to play their dominant game, Piraeus was able to set needle stitches.
But there was a forsaken on the goalkeeper Manuel Neuer.
For example, when he put a shot of ideye over the latte (56).
Before the new, Guardiola had a four-chain with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, who made it good.
Mario Götze, after muscular problems back in the box, sat out first.
The World Cup hero only gave green light after the final training, the sports director Matthias Sammer said at "Sky": "If you want to make something else out of it, that's already evil."
In the first time, Guardiola also decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the attacked Lewandowski (54.).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, per elfmeter Müller put another one on it.
Before the game, the stadium had come to Krawallen.
After a smaller group of partially suspected Bavarian fans in their audience block had apparently provoked the supporters of hosts Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and went against the Munich supporters with batches.
At least one Bavarian fan was transported from the stadium.
If you smoke, you have a higher risk of losing your teeth.
He who smokes does not only harm the lungs, but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long-term study.
The good news is that the risk is falling rapidly when you leave.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is reflected in the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers were at risk of losing their teeth early to the 2.5- to 3.6-fold higher.
The scientists had observed more than 23.300 participants.
The main causes of tooth failure are caries and inflammation of the gums, the DIfE stresses.
For these parodontitis smoking is a risk factor, the authors stress.
The link between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent gums inflammation in smokers.
It was not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of karie.
But people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take more than ten years to get the risk back to the level of non-smokers, said first author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham.
It was necessary to convince people to become non-smokers, study director Heiner Boeing of DIfE said: "Smoking reduces life time."
Not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our knowledge, also leads to good dental health up to the old age.
In Germany, more than 20% of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by inactivity, the DIfE reported.
Previous studies would have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth failure.
The new long-term study supports the findings.
Archeologists meet at Cologne's Rheinufer on remains from the late antiquity
For the time being, archaeological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
In the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rheinboulevard archeologists of the Roman-German Museum Skelette and remains of historical buildings have excavated, said Museum Director Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called ground monuments.
In all construction projects in the district of Cologne, the museum is always used as a specialist in archaeological land-view care.
In the third construction section of the Rheinboulevard, the archaeologists now became fifth.
It was already known from text documents that a fortress and a church stood in the 4th century and in the 8th century, explained Trier.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 graves was discovered, which was probably part of the church.
Young woman caught by freight train
After a young woman at the train station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern has died, the federal police ask for help from the people.
On the early Wednesday morning around 1.40 o'clock the woman from the direction of the station building came across the track at the end of the platform and was caught by a freight train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
By recording the train, according to the Federal Police, she has suffered the most serious injuries.
She was given emergency medical treatment on site and was taken to a hospital by rescue forces.
The reason for the night crossing of the young woman is not known to the investigating officials.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
There are residents or passers of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364).
Information about the cause of the accident can be given under 24 hours and free of charge hotline of the Federal Police under telephone 0800 / 6888000 or any other police service.
Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
The EU Commission has proposed a major reform of the current Arbitration System to defuse the dispute on the proposed TTIP transatlantic free trade agreement.
The controversial private conciliation bodies for disputes between companies and States are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system, which is much more traditional in its functioning.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," said European Commissioner Cecilia Malmström.
The Swedish is planning to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position into the free trade talks with the US.
The German government announced support.
TTIP is intended to create the world's largest free trade area with 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitration procedures provide for the EU and the US to jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They should come from the EU, the US and third countries in equal parts.
For the first time there is also a second instance.
It would allow it to object to judgments.
So far, the parties to the proceedings have agreed on arbitrators and there has been no opposition to their judgments.
In the discussion over the past few months, it was clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long term, it intends to work towards an International Investment Court, according to its own information.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be resolved.
The investor-State Arbitration (ISDS), especially required by large groups, is considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe to TTIP.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, through which companies can claim compensation at the expense of taxpayers, remove national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campaign identified the EU Commission's proposals as insufficient.
It was above all criticised that they should not apply to the free trade agreement already negotiated with Canada (Ceta).
The German Secretary of State Matthias Machng (SPD), on the other hand, called the plans a great step forward.
The Commission takes into account key points of the reform that Federal Minister of Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel developed with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration was off the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström's plans.
The European Business Association, BusinessEurope, warned against restricting the business's potential for action by too many new rules.
It was said that this could penalise particularly small and medium-sized enterprises.
When the talks on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) free trade agreement were concluded, it remained unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been going on since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US.
Originally, a framework for the agreement should already be established at the end of this year.
This date is no longer considered to be sustainable.
Delicater Folk of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
11 years ago, Sufjan Stevens is on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (today: Luxor).
There is a Flipchart next to him, on which the shy-looking folk singer has recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with a felt pencil.
The whole audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Stevens's lecture.
He tells about his minutiful and beautifully arranged songs, using different places that he keeps recording on the map.
Where they were born and what it looks like there, in his home.
Since then, Stevens has been a wonderful creative lunatic.
With the 2003 released and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State," the songs are well-composed, which can be harmoniously very close to the American folk of the late sixties, but at any time drifting into the great opulent.
There is a rumor that "Michigan" is the first part of a series that is confused: each of the 50 states of the United States should be sung in a row.
But already in 2004 and in the vicinity of the Rhine, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and positively breaks certain expectations.
Reduced, Stevens is showing up here.
The guitar and banjo are enough for him live.
A year later, the New York-based musician returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise"), a well-celebrated masterpiece is published in 2005.
Overboard with ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album is part of the American Billboard charts and is not missing in any annual record of the influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then uses "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic pieces.
This sixth regular studio album is still widely orchestrated, but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
The stage shows here will be the colorful spectacle of neon-forehead bands and large fluorescent stage decks, which have long been removed from the smaller clubs.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring Germany as part of a five-member band.
In the dark held Hamburger More!
He mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell" available since March.
Although almost 2000 guests are now banished in their chairs, the well-matured Stevens return to intimacy and to the folk.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians is playing through the wide-ranging album.
From the audience you can hear: The lecture is "opulter" and you can thus throw away the "record in substance."
It is only for an addition that Stevens thanks himself modestly, plays acoustically few older songs and eventually boils down under a gratifying applause.
Jeremy Corbyns' debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyns' debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time is expected with great excitement.
The new Labour President, Jeremy Corbyn, is to make his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and to start with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, with his performance probably being examined by the media and by the local Labour Members.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyn's leadership, because after his appointment it will be a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labour Chairman to remain silent during a memorial to the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain on Tuesday during the singing of the national anthem, has provoked criticism of a number of Tory-MPs and is the focus of several front-page stories in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A speaker from Mr. Corbyn said he "stood in a respectful silence" and he recognised the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the air battle around England."
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program that he advised the Labour Chairman to sing the national anthem, "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr. Corbyn's top team, and they are calling for differences in the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader.
The political correspondent of the BBC Robin Brant says that political differences also "stack" within the labour, according to Mr Corbyn's comments on the position on the European Union and the limitation of profits.
Mr. Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour made changes to remove the whole idea of a limit.
Hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadow labour and pension minister, said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government's plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour President to face David Cameron, since he is the head of Tory, over the Dispatch box in Parliament in the last decade.
The Labour President, who has promised another policy approach, says that he has "Crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontive, and that he will not be able to do anything about it, but rather to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow of economic minister, will be represented by him if he does not participate - for example, if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He has also raised the idea that other colleagues sometimes take the floor, and that he has referred to John Bercov, the spokesman of the House of Commons, in order to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from the policy of a "Kasperle Theatre," which is often linked to the Prime Minister's Question Time, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed to do so.
Since it was first sent on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was considered the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his colleagues in Parliament, although critics argued that it had become a caricature and needed far-reaching reforms.
'Shot in Joburg': homeless young people trained as photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a tough place when you are homeless.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and thus earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg ge) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people how to take photos of their surroundings and gain a profit from it.

Pound increases due to accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound increased in a jump-up manner according to data showing an increase in the UK's wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and July, the result without bonuses in the United Kingdom increased by 2.9% compared to the same period of the previous year.
This percentage has been the fastest and most accurate estimate of the time of an increase in interest rates since 2009.
The pound increased by more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and had climbed to €1.3730 up to 0.84% against the euro.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6.2229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20% jump after the acquisition of the rival AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - are rereporting growth.
Glencore's shares increased by 5% after the mining giant said that it had taken $2.5 billion by selling shares as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, with a 4.3% decrease after Goldman Sachs had put his assessment on "sell" for the company rating.
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sports clothing company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the half-year.
The head of JD Sports says that higher wages are at risk of expansion.
The managing director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers."
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company, he says.
The costs could hit the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and that could mean that there are less jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lupic 21 years old, a hangman with a big, fancy hair.
The guy with the platinum-blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy.
More like more.
At the moment, Mr. Bieber is in Berlin.
And generation U17 is going crazy.
Like Viktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton."
It's okay.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 am, however, the policy has been sitting on the cold stone plates in front of Berlin's luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber building: here you live Idol, whose poster is hanging up in Stettin, since Monday night.
The suite where the Canadian singer lives costs exactly as much a day as her mom Ewa deserves in half a year.
If ever.
She says, "Actually, my Viktoria should be in the tenth grade in high school."
"I'll fill her a dream."
Compulsory school?
Who's itchin '?
The fans don't.
Not even beekeepers themselves.
He took care of it anyway.
For the advertising in the commercial break of the Superbowl he collected three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickle company washed many, many dollars into the beekeeper account.
And with every doll that looks like him and goes over the shop table, Bieber also collects.
If Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you're surprised at the window.
More than 100 million is what he was supposed to have taken.
Some say the hype is going too far.
Others stress that Bieber is in place in the United States and the United Kingdom with his new single "What do you mean?" 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros.
At least he does.
Pegida poster brings Lebanese on potato-winner idea
Potatoes or döner?
It is both possible - in the potato driver that the Oldenburger Imbit owner Hani Alhay has developed.
Inspired by the spell "Potato instead of Döner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay has put potatoes and meat together on a spice.
On the idea, a poster brought him to a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "Potatoes instead of Döner," which he had just seen on TV.
Since then, in his shop, a barbecue spice has been spinning, which is covered with meat and potatoes.
"This is Multiculti for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has now been registered by the Lebanese to the Patent Office in Munich.
According to the Authority, it has recently been protected as a utility model.
How much meat and how much potatoes the spice contains, Alhay does not want to betray.
Only so much: "It tastes even better together," he says.
The culinary understanding of the world is also good for its customers.
Metcash launches ground-level campaign to combat Aldi-Incoming
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA branches from an Aldi move in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesalers Metcash has launched a ground-level campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing to open two sales centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through the social media, as well as through events such as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as ice manufacturer Simmo from Dunsborough, who distributes samples in IGA stores and sales store owners who sell cheap tickets to the South Australian football league to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defence strategy on 29 September when the wholesale of food, alcohol and equipment is implementing its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake because South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcashs IGA store business and generate higher profit margins than Metcashs IGA network in the Eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much greater market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that, 12 months after the opening of its first markets, Aldi will take away about five percent of the food market in these two countries and will take away all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, the analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose 360 million sales per year and Metcash 250 million dollars by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and will generate sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and food business and in the quantities on the high fixed-cost basis of Metcash could cost about $13 million before interest and taxes, said Mr. Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loses market shares in the Eastern states, mainly in Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most faithful.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's sales in the food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and will reduce the market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr. Douglass's comments.
But it is assumed that a member of Metcash's board made contact with Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenues from Metcash's food and food trade, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operating debt reduction with simultaneous pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler is fighting and investing more than $150 million to compare sales prices with Coles and Woolworth's in hundreds of products every week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their shops by faster growing fresh food and providing a better selection of private label food.
Metcashs head of business Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and store-repair programmes will be made to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick yrgios and, in the opinion of the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy, deserves more praise than criticism of his own behaviour.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, who is always called "Special Ks," came into the spotlight by the infamous discussion of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualification game in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated by the referee twice, and Harrison said, "Wavrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten the child."
While he was last seen beating up a tennis bat after a Krampf prosecuted a potential US-Open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was constantly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-finals against the UK.
"One thing I'm pretty excited about is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a little involved in the fight," said Healy.
He broke a bat when he lost to the US Open because of a seizure, but he's not the first player to break a bat of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But, really, he's been very good at the US Open, even under the pretty provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little too hard.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he's never had a problem with the other players, he's respected in the changing area, he's training hard, he's good in shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take into account the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right one for all, but he assures the man from Canberra as a long-term integral part of the team. "
"At first we wish the team to be fully focused on the competition and not all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," said Healy.
And I think Nick has made a very quick rise to what people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He's getting into the public's eyes, and he's made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to make him understand the consequences of his action. Some time out of the spotlight in which he can only think about it, I think it's appropriate, and it's best for the team and it's best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, withholds refugees
Hungary declared the state of emergency and closed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held hold all those who tried to get into the country illegally, all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed the border, when hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-man's land and retreated Serbian officials with indignation.
The people who had fled from violence were stuck and built tents there for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries.
But frustration increased.
When a police helicopter was hovering over them, the migrants "open the border!" and cried out insults against the Hungarian police.
Some rejected food and water from protest.
Serbia's Foreign Minister said it was "unacceptable" that migrants from Hungary were sent back, while more and more came from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
There must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days, "said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serbian border came one day after the 28-nation block at a dispute meeting in Brussels could not agree on a common immigration policy.
However, the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the overcrowded Italy and Greece, and expressed their hope that, in the end - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU countries would take up another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
On Tuesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
However, Hungary did not put its hopes on an early action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency in two southern regions, which was launched on Tuesday, gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, so that they could lock down roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijarto said that his country also plans to build a barbed-wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were used in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a significant bottleneck and a point of entry into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most of the incoming economic refugees are looking for a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly in conflict with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that entered into force in Hungary at midnight make the crossing of the border or the damage to the 4-meter (13-foot) high fence, which the government had built along the southern border to Serbia, a crime. These laws also establish higher prison sentences for convicted human traffickers.
"Due to the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency," said Zoltan Kovacs, the government spokesman, in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree to the use of the military, which is expected for next week, but reporters from Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers on the border with vehicles and dogs for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, State Security Adviser for Orban, said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already penetrated deeper into the country.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are about to fix the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border crossings with Serbia after a train wagon with barbed wire had arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressed a crowd to get in there.
About 20 were able to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead in front of Bernie Sanders halved in national survey
The former US Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit lead in the democratic race for nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground over her.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre-elections (58 percent in advance), while Sanders is second, with 27 percent (17 percent increase).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is running for the presidential office, will receive 15% of the democratic voters of the pre-elections.
More than five months before the start of the pre-elections, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is clear which candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more stable in their choice than the other candidates.
Since the CBS news survey, Clinton has lost in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some profits.
Clinton has a great lead in women and moderate people, but these advances have been reduced.
Their support for men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points back here.
Clinton's advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has disappeared, and they and Sanders are now at the same level.
Clinton, however, still has a great lead on the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders with a two-digit lead on the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead on this group.
About half of the democratic voters of the pre-election country-wide say that they would be enthusiastic to support Clinton if it were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and a further 15 percent would support her only because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
Maybe not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are especially excited about her.
The views are more mixed with those who do not support Clinton at the moment - only about a quarter would support them enthusiastically.
While 48 percent of the democratic voters of the pre-elections say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, less Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
If Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention their connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
The agreement to deal with the problems and the selectivity is also quoted.
As the Vice-President is throwing a potential for the presidential office into the balance sheet, 57% of the democratic voters of the pre-election want to see him in the race - although one third believe that he should not.
When democratic voters of the pre-elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
Of Clinton's followers, more than half say that Biden's second choice is far from Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton's lead in front of Sanders, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election, but this figure has fallen by 78 percent last month.
Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that sees it as the "most selectable" has increased.
However, when it comes to the question of what is more important for a candidate, democratic voters call questions about selectivity.
As last month, no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these pre-election voters is found unacceptable.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results for some important features of their party's pre-election voters.
The majority consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and with strong leadership qualities.
Biden best cuts off with honesty in the three candidates, while Clinton's strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion on it.
Democratic voters of the pre-elections generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server are still being asked during the term of office as Foreign Minister, most of the pre-elections democratic voters are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions in general.
But it's another story in the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about one third are satisfied.
The public opinion on this was split in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent said that her opinion had worsened.
They are mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered to be honest and trustworthy by the voters of their party, this is still a problem for them as a whole among registered voters: only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of the voters do not think they are an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55% of the voters in the country also see Trump as not honest and untrustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump get good grades in the lead.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush are best off with honesty.
A majority sees Sanders more than honest, but like Carson, many people don't have an opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 democratic voters in the pre-elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is in the country-wide survey close to Donald Trump
Ben Carson is in the latest survey of CBS News / New York Times close to Donald Trump
The two candidates now account for half of the support of the voters in the new survey, and others are losing dramatically.
Republican voters continue to support trump in large numbers across the country. Support is growing from 23% in the last CBS survey, which was conducted before Fox News debate last month, by 27% in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson is well-on-the-job in demographic groups, and that Trump is outnumbered among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kaisich, has been defeated with Wisconsin's Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the lowest, from 10% support last month to 2% now.
The former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, the former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place at 6%.
The error margin in the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN / ORC survey, which was published last week, shows that Carson is increasing in the polls - he lands at 19% support for the Republicans, behind the trump with 32% support.
The recent ABC News / Washington Post survey also clearly showed Trump in front of Carson.
With a view to a Carson rising in the last week, Trump found some side-seams for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized to question Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during a campaign performance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even if peak values are only measured in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is already enough for swimming enthusiasts to find even warm water.
A bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some people no longer go to the sea: maximum 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week, the German weather service (DWD) reports.
On the other hand, bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean: in the east, there is even up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is in the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood burdened with the death of a Baruch College-Neuling
Almost two years after a student died during a fervent ritual of a student relationship in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.
= = = New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood = = = = Chun "Michael" Deng was brutally attacked during an introduction ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death.
Officials said he was loaded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and he was repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target through a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about a headache, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng passed out and allegedly waited an hour before they took him to a hospital, the police said.
But they had time to change Deng's clothes, to google his symptoms, and Andy Meng to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point the members began to hide utensils and put the well-being of the brotherhood in principle above that of Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning of his injuries.
After an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly added to the head, torso and thigh with blunt force.
"Too many families were destroyed by the horrors of the Brotherhood. At least one student has died every year since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.
Brotherhood and its members must be brought to account, and this step by authorities is very important.
A county grand jury of Monroe recommended a third-degree charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also charged with the harassment and formation of a criminal association.
"We not only want to make the people involved responsible, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned this - officially or unofficially - we will also take them into account," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the national Brotherhood has revoked its membership of the local group.
This will happen when the Fed increases interest
A rise in interest rates is coming, and the house is going to fade, yields for bonds are going to rise, and the economy is going to slide into a recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long this will take and how long it will last.
In particular, history offers little guidance to the economy about the process.
A recession occurred within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
Therefore, representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when it starts to increase interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants could see that the whole excitement may have been exaggerated due to an increase in interest rates.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis is inevitably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of" cheap money, "said Julian Jessop, head economist at Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal heights, but still to low levels to lead to seismic shock, which many seem to fear.
This does not, however, mean that there will be no effects.
Here is a historical trend-based look at how some areas of the economy could react:
As the market has seen last month, the anticipation of interest increases can do things for a while volatil.
As soon as the increase occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for assets to be devalued 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what is happening after the Fed's interest rate increases.
More specifically, in the last 35 years the market is mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate increase, quite flat in the 250 days after (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to the normal state after 500 days, with an average return in the last six past cycles of 14.4 percent according to a current analysis that Bob Doll, head of the plant-stratige at Nuveen Asset Management, published at Barron's.
The Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares is likely to occur later in the increase cycle and the return on the market is beginning to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rates often promote them.
In the current case, the Fed is confronted with some conditions that were not before and which could accelerate a recession.
It is very remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in the event of an increase in the Fed's interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, the nominal GDP was only twice below 4.5%.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6%, few expect this to last and only 1.5% for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest increases in such a fragile economic environment could be risky and raise the question of "whether it is different this time," said Deutsche Bank.
Market participants have taken a look at an increase in the Fed's interest rates all year round, and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this meeting, the Futures trade only indicates a 25% probability.
"In our study, all the increase cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super-cycle with an increasing growth in GDP, and the pre-recession heights have been set in the shadows very soon after the start of recovery," says the report.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile as the market anticipates an increase in interest rates and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on shares when they change their strategic course.
In the case of bonds, the returns seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / reduction takes place in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the bond yields fall immediately, said Deutsche Bank.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a closer correlation between longer and shorter bonds and a deflation of the curve.
High-interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher yields," said Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
It is interesting, Jones thinks that the markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the fall in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the yield curve is flat, credit margins have increased and volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the Fed is tightening its strategy.
In general, companies that deal with the greater part of their business in the US will benefit from this when interest rates increase and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse off, as an increasing dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts.
"History shows that" quality "shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate increase," said Goldman Sachs analysts in a report for the customers.
Firms with a strong balance sheet have on average exceeded by 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low-quality pensions by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt is going to be a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose most, said Goldman.
Outside the pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Sparers could see profits through higher yields, even if experts are different in their opinion as to how fast this will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says Member of Parliament Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticised the station for its "demise"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated The British
Parliament's colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "turns" to Classic FM, claims a leading member of Parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he is doing something that the private channels do not.
The Conservative Member Andrew Bingham also told the BBC bosses that the public radio station was "stupid" and increasingly no longer to be distinguished from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word" stupid "- but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, appear to be The British only under a different name.
So, if you're trying to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you're actually just imitating what's already on the market, "said Mr. Bingham.
BBC Director-General rejected the allegations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public awareness.
What I'm learning from Radio 3, I'm not going to learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is really unsurpassed.
"And the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and order new works, I think it is really important," he said.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that more hard work had to be done to involve the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only element of BBC production, which, during the hearing in the Committee on the Selection of Culture, Media and Sport, got under fire to step on the commercial rivals.
The Tory Member Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was bought by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced "in a special BBC way."
He added that he would like the company to "find a hit from our own stable" when it started a series of entertainment next time.
However, he refused to exclude the order of further series of The Voice in the future or to spend money on the payers for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales increased the slowest in August and the Black Friday may be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015 there was seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slowed down the expenditure
For over a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of the UK's main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities.
But experts say that there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000, with only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say that there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for previous years and go down to 2000, then this has always developed over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.
He said that online sales increased three years ago, as buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments, for example at home on the sofa.
But now this is happening, and we may see that growth is falling.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases before this event, which will take place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers paged around their computers to make their deals, and some dealer websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where the buyers were fighting for bargain, could stop buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that out of 5 £issues a little more than 1 £was spent online.
For some products such as TV and washing machines, more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims bury the killed in Mecca in the crane accident - Bin Laden's family is being sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried through the streets by Muslims at the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia puts the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin-Laden group at the expense of
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane crashed into Mecca's great mosque.
Traitors, largely dressed in white, filled the route to pay their respects when the first of the dead began their last journey to the al-Moatheem cemetery.
The mourning process passed through the Holy Place, where only days before a building crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the beds.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a penalty on the building company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster that also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 better people who were killed when a crane fell through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane was under way.
Mr. Akram and his parents were in the Great Mosque before the start of the annual Haddsch.
Saudi officials have already firmly agreed that the Haddsch will continue to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today King Salman said that the Bin-Laden group should not have left the crane's arm when it was not used.
An Arab version of the decree published by the state's Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin-Laden Group is co-responsible for the collapse.
The English-speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the company's management of travel abroad was prohibited.
At the beginning of this week, Salman was praised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane, which fell into an inner court of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Hadsch, which will take place later this month.
The Bin-Laden Group has not issued statements on the collapse of the Krans and its representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also struck the group for not up-to-date security measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's great mosque as part of the massive construction project run by the Bin-Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been connected for decades with the Saudi Arabia family and has taken over major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990's.
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people are staying in the hospital.
Government representatives ordered that 1 million rial (£174,000) be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanent injured.
Other injured persons receive half of this amount.
B & Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British increasingly employ craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe has increased
This leads to the opening of 200 more screenfix shops aimed at craftsmen
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B & Q sales outlets across the country
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that British workers are laying down their hammers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out their work at home.
If you can handle a hammer or a brush to paint walls, you seem to be a minority today.
For the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to do work in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B & Q.
Véronique Laury, new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the construction market chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices has now been overtaken.
This is why Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix Shops, which are aimed at craftsmen and close 60 B & Q sales outlets.
Mrs. Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten buying decisions at the store are made by women.
At the moment, the men are outnumbered by the employees.
She said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more single female households that do more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said, "There's still a majority of men working in our branches.
We must move this more towards a balance.
In principle, half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five leading companies in the UK listed in the FTSE100 Index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and financial board.
Mrs Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher reported a decrease in the half-year profit and sales after the group owed the costs of closing the shops.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B & Q, will open 200 new branches.
Officials of Aich / Dob for infidelity in court
At the Zlagenfurt National Court on Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Vice-Master Aich / Dob had to be responsible for infidelity and tax evasion.
The defendants did not plead guilty.
One of them was also charged with abuse of office.
He was acquitted of this accusation in May.
The current process has been postponed.
According to the Supreme Prosecutor Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, it had become clear that the defendants used funds from club accounts, through which they were allowed to dispute in their functions, for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011.
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.
The sports officers are also charged with financial crimes.
This fact was the decision of the President of the Council of the Schöffensenate, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It is to be negotiated at a later date.
In order to reject the infidelity, the defense stated that the association had not at any time created an asset disadvantage.
The sports operators would have only charged expenses and the sports club, for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they would have invested a lot of time and money, would have been out of debt - the liabilities in 2001 amounted to around 600,000 schilling (around 44,000 euros).
"At that time we were facing the situation: do we continue to run the club or do we lock it?," said one of the defendants, in the brothel of the financial office's major auditors.
With his colleague and co-defendant, he then decided to take on this task.
With all the risks.
"We have made money, put our life insurance as security at the bank," he said at the time of the collection.
The association had been agreed: you can manage the money freely, but no debt can be made.
Furthermore, in the event of financial success, the payment of the expenditure compensation was decided retroactively until 1991.
Therefore, part of the effort compensation was paid out only years later, that is, from 2003, when a plus was in the account.
For this reason, flat-rate and not detailed accounts appeared, the former Obmann explained the transactions.
The accounts and booklets managed the two defendants together, said the second defendant.
Why the payments had not been disclosed to the association in detail, the judge asked.
The association was not interested in the details of the financial statement that only the freedom of debt had been important, the answer said.
When an official investigation for abuse began in 2011, an amount of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the association account.
These were reserves, the defendants explained.
This securities account ran on the name of the second defendant and was not known to the association, according to his statement.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
The question had no answer to that for a long time.
Then he finally said that he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If anything had happened to him, no one would have known about this money, the DA would have put it in the room.
The co-defendant had been informed, and the officer justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as "compensation for damages."
Why damages?, the judge and the prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant said that he did not agree with this wording because the association had never been harmed.
But what should I do when the lawyer says, "You're all out of your mind with this."
"Am I a legal representative?" he asked.
The official also said that he never paid a cent, he only charged mileage and diets.
In diets he charged the association 1,000 euros per month, but the actual effort had been much higher, he added.
The defendants were unable to present precise documents for the early years.
They were no longer kept after an operating test in which everything had been considered to be correct, they explained.
The second defendant had also received mileage money.
All the repayments were made in cash, for which he had to go from his place of residence to the bank to Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main negotiation will continue on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard takes another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the three-year reduction in staff, the computer giant will reduce further jobs in the division of the company.
The number of jobs in the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) will not end.
As part of its restructuring, the US technology group plans to reduce the number of jobs from 25,000 to 30,000 in its company's customers.
This will save costs of $2.7 billion (€2.4 billion), the company announced on Tuesday.
The step will lead to a special burden of around $2.7 billion, which will start from the fourth quarter.
The three-year reduction of 55,000 jobs has not yet been completed.
HP employed around 302,000 people at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year.
After exchange, the Hewlett Packard share was 2.3 percent.
The group of printers from the California Palo Alto is currently splitting up: the computer and printer business is to be bundled in a new company this time - separated from the more future-oriented areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange.
A again disappointing PC sales and a weaker demand from corporate customers for its services last increased the world's second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo.
In the third quarter of July, sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.5 percent.
Sales fell by 8 percent to just under $25.4 billion.
This led to a decline in revenues in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds to change in the industry with a split-up and massive division of jobs.
The 76-year-old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman has only recently responded to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and doing more and more business online.
Whitman's restructuring plans provide for a total reduction of about 55,000 jobs.
Conflict: majority support the anti-IS training mission
However, a direct participation of German soldiers in the fight in Iraq would be largely opposed: 54% opposed, 35% agreed.
The fact that other states are flying air attacks against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61% positive.
24% are opposed to intervention in the conflict.
A cooperation with the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad rejects 51% of the respondents, and 20% are in favour.
29 percent couldn't make up their mind.
Car: Second press day at the 66th IAA
The exhibition will focus on connected, self-driving cars and electric mobility until September 27.
After two press days, Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automotive Exhibition under the motto "Mobility connects" on Thursday.
The general audience can visit the IAA from Saturday.
As two years ago, the organizers of the VDA car association expect some 900 000 visitors.
Röszke: outbreak of violence at the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have used the Serbian border at Röszke tear gas and water launchers against several hundred refugees.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point.
He reported by phone:
A group of refugees broke the border.
There was a police line formed and a water launcher was standing behind the police.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officials.
The officials first used uninterrupted pepper spray.
After that, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprouted towards the refugees.
The group was then disbanded.
The refugees have now withdrawn somewhat in waiting.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas were screaming.
Other refugees were saddling in themselves and suffering from respiratory distress.
The press speakers of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
The world is watching when the US Notenbank meets on two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not to raise interest for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists interviewed by Reuters found that a little more than half of them, who thought that the Fed would do this last week, now think that the Fed will be a little longer and that interest rates at the present level of 0-0.25% will hold.
It's a historical event because it's been seven years since the Fed set interest on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalisation of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, head of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is at a relatively good level of performance, trillion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy view of global conditions.
It has warned the markets to focus on an increase, but the signs indicate that the chances against such a step are good.
The decision will be announced at 8 p.m. on Thursday
Shot of death at Delta State University left letters of apology
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later on the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "sorry" for the first murder and wanted "to make it happen," authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, a lecturer in geography and social science at Delta State University, called the emergency number at 10: 00 on Monday morning
And he said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency call officer that the police had to send police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night," and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" is in the house, but "no one will disturb," but he will probably be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give it to him.
Lamb didn't explain his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found Amy Prentiss's body, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, saying, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to make it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me. "
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday night when police officers surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's performance."
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday, there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangular relationship."
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said that they were married for about seven years, as a "good person."
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who was 19, and she was "destroyed on the ground."
He said that Prentiss was her daughter's "absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, met with Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles
The police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them, "He's not going to jail."
When police took him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car aside, fled on foot, ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot.
In the spring of 2015, Lamb received a doctorate from Delta State University, as his life expectancy on the University's website.
Stars who have lost their fortune
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001, he fought against leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his long-standing partner, Farrah Fawcett, for cancer.
The actor is also supposed to be fighting drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
I'm sure all this will require his tribute.
Eurowings: Lufthansa is rebuilding the company
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organisation alone.
150 of the around 1000 managers worldwide will cost the group's conversion to the job.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilot union.
Lufthansa is building its business structure and evaluating Eurowings's cheap daughter.
The aim of the reorientation was to make a profit contribution of around EUR 500 million per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board of directors for the passenger business.
The Eurowings low-cost airline should be developed as independently as possible.
In future, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the management team for Chief Carsten Spohr.
With the redeployment, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
To date, the organization of the 120 000 employees company has been complex.
The airlines were established under the roof of the Passage Airline Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the collective conflict with the pilot association Cockpit (VC), the negotiations will be resumed after the court-stopped strike this Thursday.
That's what the union told us.
The subject of the talks is to be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wanted "a year with a forecast record result" to achieve sustainable results as soon as possible.
The conflict between the union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
The background is the "Wings" concept, in addition to the transition supply of the pilots.
It provides that in the fight against competitors, Lufthansa will outsource routes to the Eurowings company's own cheap line.

Luke Shaw from Manchester United can't play for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at the Manchester Champions League defeat at the PSV Eindhoven.
While this made the left-wing foreign defender cry and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had broken into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He'll be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, has it very hard and then plays fantastic, and then this happens.
He had an oxygen mask in the locker room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it'll take six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the hanging of an 11-meter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee had been wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say that an elfmeter and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account was: "I thank you all for your news. Words cannot describe how broken I am, my way to recovery begins now, I come back stronger."
On the subject: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat of the PSV
With the European Championship in France, the England Defender has an additional incentive to recover by next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, "It's a very bad injury."
When a player with this kind of injury leaves the place, all are very sad about it.
It's never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Gals Holland team in the 2014 World Cup.
"He is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that it is a very bad injury, it is not good," said Cocu.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction, so it looked like he had touched it, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In the conversation with SBS6, Moreno said, "I know how it feels, I know how hard this can be.
I feel very bad about it. I'm so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital - after a foulgame by Chris Smalling.
I'm sure David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
It's one thing all parents will learn soon: If your child loves a book, it won't be long until you know it almost by heart.
Unless you may be David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister decided on The Lorax, the environmental flaw published by Dr. Seuss in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the company's website SuperCamps, and continues: "funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book I like to read to my children, because there seems to be always a picture or a message that we have missed so far."
All nice and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the story of the book, instead shows a content of the 2012 film version, added the new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"In the middle of the masked city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, is hoping to win the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," one reads. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel and who died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if this was not yet suspicious enough: the text presented by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lorax film, which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database, and thus begins: "In the masked city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, hopes to win the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the action of the book. Here, an unnamed boy hears how the local environment is devastated by the money-greedy, trees-fading, thneed-stricken once-ler despite the protests of the naming Lorax, a howling, moustache-bearing being, "that speaks in the name of the trees."
Most likely such a relatively low PR task has been delegated to a helper who has not read The Lorax 20 times in a row to a child.
A Downing Street speaker said that the text probably came from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's employees, but did not give any further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England's team, but it's still hard
To meet Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but when you see the box that England has chosen for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 test-series defeat is not on my card.
I wouldn't rule out a win-out.
Alastair Cooks page may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting setting, and the community spirit is strong; they will not wear scars of 2012, just a youth-positive attitude.
With the ball Moeen Ali develops as a spin-bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it is an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
Message related to this: Adam Lyth is leaving the England Test Framework and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth out is, of course, hard for me to analyze as his head coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination because - and I said this earlier - players are their own best choice.
A long time ago, you would have extended the course of Lyth, but he was in control of his own destiny.
If he is hoping to make further runs for Yorkshire, another chance will come.
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he did not do so well, and that is not surprising to me; he is above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test batter gets to put his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away.
The only accusation that can be raised was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in the highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming in, and he's a perp I highly appreciate.
He is an X-factor cricket player, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he reached 236 against us on a Trent Bridge, which hit us very much.
He must have at least the same opportunities as the ones before him, but this depends, of course, on the team position in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of having Moeen beat next to Cook, which would provide an extra spin bowler and get four quick turns up, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a perp can't beat there, and this left-hand guy has already shown that he's a devil's ass from cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number three for her, and there's no big difference.
My former team mate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he appeared as an opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs immediately and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the box as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him he impressed me very much as a young man.
People may look at their statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there are no large number of backup-Spinners who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen youth.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made a few clever additions to the team.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as an advisor to the test games could be a master's coup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a lot of experiences, as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the changing cabin can bring fresh wind, even if the news is in line with the previous one.
Colly's team mate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at the One-Dayers, Root got a similar break against Australia, and for my part, I have no problem with it.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made in a light heart.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = UK exit from the EU) could win if the economy were to become a flute by 2017
David Cameron's unsolved renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will be in deeper trouble every day, even without the choice of the genius Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn as the leader of Labour or the TUC, who has been seriously disputing about Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat said the other day that some Member States, as deeply entangled in various crises as the EU is and not always on their own, are tired of the agenda of split concessions and disturbing Treaty changes that they often do not want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it would not like it either if they were at risk of social protection.
We could also call it Dave and Georges Selfie's agenda.
Prime Minister and finance ministers climb at summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants an outside-looking UK inside the EU tent - "Let's not go alone with France," says Berlin - and shows that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they don't care if we stay or go.
Germany's carefully-appointed Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as has happened for the over-long-standing people like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande looks at his re-election or his replacement in 2017.
He is also a blatant force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left.
It is difficult to imagine that they will have a leg to help the Selfie British, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they don't want because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even intentionally not be planning helpful comments, in the SNP style, during the UK's 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a bust" and "Great Britain has won nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their expense and which EU skeptics are the oligarchy of the press barons, as they were during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, but which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2: 1.
You can hardly remember Boris Johnson, the ore-euro opportunist who made a name as a "EU-straight banana" Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
With all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of tax-fearing villains, telephone-hacking foreigners and the pseudo-non-residents, who own most of our big newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought about them similar, but found that if you're sitting in a cage with a hot gorilla, you better spread bananas to distract him instead of getting his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairians than Blair himself when he resisted Cameron's referendum, because Blair had put the principle over the unadopted EU Constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened his back door.
The press never forgave him that, either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly blow on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer needs time for me - seems to be in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80's, a mistake then and today.
It may take time, but he has to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I would like to express it in a friendly way - in development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's traditional blood-carbon tendency and the wilder ones of Tory's small-Englishism can probably say yes to that.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but no Bennite" Benn said on the radio and on TV this week when the Boy Scout in him fought not to admit that Corby's appointment of provocative John McDonnell as shadow Chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70's when his old father was on TV trying to be illoyal to his Labour Cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But to fight to stay "in all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow contestants and Members after all the reports at their trial session on Monday night.
Whatever the furious bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the structure of the social media, a breeding site of paranoia and treason.
It is right not to give Cameron a free card for Europe that allows him to consider Labour's support in the referendum campaign as a matter of course, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins must think so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguities about EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoteric discussion among left dissidents, for which the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities about Nato - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC will not launch a campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superiors at home in all.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be pointless?
The US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction in the Tory government's power, which I was reminded of at the start on Monday of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise Public Health England's report on e-cigarettes
According to a government-funded agency, e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking was the result of a meeting of 12 people, partly with links to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "principle report" last month and describes it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
However, some researchers have questioned the resilience of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A key article in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extremely windy basis" on which PHE founded its main conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked whether the claims "build on stone or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects that PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people called to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), in order to bring their opinions on the damage to various nicotine-containing products to a synthesis, and the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing director was supposed to have received funds from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting said that they would receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he was supposed to have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reasons for the selection of the members of the board are not provided, but they include several known e-cigarettes champions, some of which also provide industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants in this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The meeting also included the tobacco management of PHE.
The research work of the group "says clearly" that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage to most products on most criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claims that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and well-being at PHE, said that BMJ's claims had already been addressed before.
He said, "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second life-long smoker dies from his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to that, but that we continue to have to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what is not, especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related disease, and smoking costs the National Health System £2 billion per year.
By providing clear evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national competence.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4
The former President of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop sending programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels.
He criticised the BBC for placing public-law programmes that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard-to-do time windows against the most popular shows of its rivals and of channels such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director-General, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said that he had been trying to get in touch with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 without success.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC will order or send programmes that would be clearly demonstrated by unsubsidised rivals," said Johnson to the Upper House Communication Committee in his investigation into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the radio fee, which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least make your production on programmes that others do not make or order.
They send The Voice in a first-class window because they want to achieve as wide a support as possible for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's obviously nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't see why a progressive tax programme could be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both own productions.
To be honest, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I am trying to see how this is to be public-law television.
I do not think this would even reduce the BBC.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series that ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was responsible for the hunt for assessments "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows reflect what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC show should sell like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the more public-law niche programs should "go to BBC4 where you can't measure the audience, but they do their tasks, and they can argue when they go on their seemingly sacred missions to justify £4 billion of radio charges," well, of course, we've created all these obscure programs that no one has seen. "
They put them in a window where no one ever wanted to see them.
On the radio fee, Johnson said to the committee: "I call on you to find a rather progressive system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value from this.
Of course you all think, we all think that you get a great value for £150 a year here, but for people who are a lot of money for the £150, ask me if that's true, because they don't consume much of the BBC.
The former Sky- and Channel 5-head David Elstein, who also announced before the Committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission to "inform, form and maintain."
He said that little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said it was 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and it should take an example from the public television stations in Australia and Canada to change this into "information, information and entertainment."
On the question of partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Proms, of which he said that only one handful are shown on TV, and to enter into with the commercial channels alliances to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the Nematodes change the direction in the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny Nematodes change the direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by turning on motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
More on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new process called Sonogenetics, where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the process could one day replace the deep brain stimulation, an invasive process that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Thread worms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then enter the worms.
The increased ultrasonic waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, so a report Nature Communications.
To create ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically changed the worms so that some of their motoneurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When it applies ultrasound to the changed creatures, the sound waves are reinforced by the microbubbles and transferred to the worms where they turn on the changed motoneurons.
The process has some similarities with optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons with impulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent down to the desired location in the brain on an optical fibre, low-frequency ultrasonic wave tissue can happen unhindered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the target human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment - right in front of your front door!
The ads embarrass Britain's arms trade
Watch Amnesty International Anti-Weapons Fair Video.
Terrible killer drones!
Foot-joint shredding legs!
Scatter bombs!
And electric shock rods that cause painful pain, but leave no trace!
The happy voice and the cartoon pictures leave no doubt that this ad is a fighting parody for the world's largest arms trade fair, produced by Amnesty International, to bring the British government's willingness to repress weapons to the repressive regime through the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains and which require a second look.
"Important announcement: Do you drive with the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" (Docklands Light Railway) is read in the fonts of the London Underground and the trademark of the DLR line, which turns to the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers with the DLR will drive... customers will be asked to help stop the weapons fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs," a 6 £package of bus keys that are claimed to "get access to about one third of the bus stop advertising areas on the planet."
Transport for London does not find this placation "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
After Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside of galleries.
Many artists work with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society.
Another of the anti-arms-trading posters greets the commuters on the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times over Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works for free with the graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertising of the arms fair - through an empty space of the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They were playing with the invention of a more realistic, shady corporate advertising, but "it remains more resistant by the brushing in with bright colors and animation."
"They have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is an intervention by the British government and the guarantee that torture equipment will not be acted illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors make up fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals an order from the US Army about "the AT4CS RS that was shot off by the shoulder."
This includes a "uniquely shaped head of battle, which provides outstanding effects on the inside of the target."
Whatever that does, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for life in student homes
11 years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved to a student home, still in the faith of Beret and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smile of those I have been annoyed by - and the numerous, long-term complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The entrance to student homes ranges from slightly nervous to absolutely terrifying.
It is tempting to sway: people tell you where you come from, whether and where you have taken sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you "honestly don't love or hate Marmite, because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Take a breath.
And help others do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It leads the conversation and helps you find out the people you like, unlike those you wouldn't talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and those fire extinguishers were.
Leave people alone.
The rooms of people often turn into drinks recipes, film night venues and local meeting points, but they are also the places where people get dressed and put their underwear on.
Subject: Do not think about starting a relationship at the university
Introverted people receive coarse treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refugium, but many student homes form a space-to-space-bummel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life-long friendship.
This can be hell for someone who's trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away so that I can get back the energy I used to interact with you."
Try to feel when a commilitone of sociality is exhausted - and send him a text instead of knocking on.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A guy in my dorm had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship through baking.
As you start the university at the top of the back mania, knocking at the doors of people to imagine a plate full of brownies is less strange than the welcome of the 1950's "Welcome to the neighborhood, I have baked you something. So, and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions."
To offer home-made treats is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to talk, and in the end they may be associated with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you're a decent baker.
Bad mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, the clinging of chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check with the milk owner.
The chances are good that they say they serve themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your things, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to be more balanced than my roommate, who added a dishwasher to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in prison now.
You should not make a noise that stops people from sleeping or working.
It's not just about being a decent person, it's about you being one of the people sitting in the glass house in the truest sense of the proverb.
A girl in my hall asked her neighbors if they care about putting Drum & Bass down a little bit, because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
They responded with even more loud music.
When she finally stopped at 5: 00, she kindly left her neighbors to sleep for two hours before she had her own music bummed, closed her door and went to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse were to move into the same dorm by chance?
On the other hand, it would not be abundantly embarrassing if you considered a roommate to be your future spouse, get on her, break up and then have to see her every day, and maybe live with her, like she's going over all of her friends?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to talk a little sense into your abdomen.
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone left his keys in his unlocked room, the border between an UIk and a bullying is fine than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it only takes a moment to become a boomerang.
By hiding a valuable and amusing lesson about security - but never screw up someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock your door and put your keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but do not touch your property on the ceiling more than twice.
Terraced houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate company Markus Gildner is building terraced houses in the central French corner for people who don't have much money.
For refugees, for example, but also as a signal: "Not only do refugees need living space, but also the mother and the low-earner alone."
"I show how to still build cheap and good today," says the 44-year-old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will press the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how to quickly create affordable housing: he is building house for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will press the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or gymnasium has no sustainability.
Because people stay here to a large extent.
In view of the flow of refugees, we need enough housing in the next few decades.
A very banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs the least space.
It makes integration easier.
It's different when you put people in housing blocks.
Each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers.
Each living unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a common room.
It may be that many refugees will say it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can be easily converted to the respective needs.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living area per house is 184 000 euros, without land.
That's manageable.
The construction took six months.
That's appropriate.
Did the building regulations complicate their plans?
Gildner: I went through my project correctly under construction law.
It always makes it particularly complicated the threatening Damoclessworth special construction and the space regulation.
It's creepy.
It is still considered who creates three apartments in a terraced house, needs at least three parking spaces.
Only in the cities is the place missing.
And refugees and asylum seekers don't have cars.
How did the residents react to their terraced house project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But don't you make the competition more competitive for affordable apartments?
Gildner: True is: We have had a tree in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built, which hardly anyone can afford.
My project has the message, and the normal people also need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single-parent mother or the low-earner.
I will show you how to build cheap and good today.
That's what this is about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and was first involved in environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the settings app, tap "General" and then select "Software Update."
When it's ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install it.
Some have encountered problems after installation as they receive an error message that says that the "software update has failed."
To avoid the problem, users are recommended to either wait until the storm goes back or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more unlikely by slashing the update. It will also be easier to do this when you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is completed.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is in the vicinity of a charger so that the battery is loaded.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update to continue as the phone may turn off in half way and this could lead to a drop in the update.

You should also ensure that before your download you have checked our checklist of all things to prevent things from going wrong and protecting yourself if they do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that accelerate and repair the operating system.
Rosberg's only foreign currency: Full attack
In the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1, Nico Rosberg has only one motto: "Full Attack" against his well-known Mercedes team mate Lewis Hamilton.
The World Cup second stressed before the start of the decisive seven overseas races "that I have nothing more to lose."
53 points separate the vice world champion from the title defender and double champion Hamilton before the night race in Singapore this Sunday.
The British already won seven of the previous 12 season races and is also a favorite in the city state.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old British won the race.
It is still unclear whether the current smog in the city state will influence the Great Prix of Singapore.
For days a dark bell has been hanging over the city, caused by fires on the neighbouring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The chess club "Chess Friends Bad Kissingen," founded three months ago, has included another member in its series, so the number of members increased to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen for the cure.
Gauselmann is the carrier of the Federal Cross of Merit 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen has supported Gauselmann with a donation that President Alfred Klein received.
This makes it possible to record chess players who cannot make the membership contribution.
Youth work and talent search are also to be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes to see the membership of the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Red-White" as an expression of his relationship with the spa city.
Quartier's office is looking for direct contact
Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonistift have joined together under the coat of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to discussions you can also take part in courses there.
The social foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city centre.
More specifically, to the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new quarters office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, now, seniors and Council-seeking information on questions such as care insurance or health and care insurance services.
For years, we have been seeing with our outpatient care service that often caring relatives are left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"It is also rare to use many of the cash benefits, because the complexity of the insurance is hardly understood," explained the new landlord Jutta Weigand, who, as a business manager, is also responsible for the Antony and the Mayor's Hospital as well as for the "Amadeus" outpatient service.
In addition to the discussions, the new district office offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this purpose the Saludis was taken into the boat.
Therefore, additional offers such as crash prevention, memory training or physiotheraptic treatment can be used.
The offers from the Senior Centre and the Saludis are ideally complementary.
Saludis stands for prevention, precaution and rehab.
"The Senior Centre for Care and Care," said Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is the fact that both managers are particularly concerned with demographic change.
For this makes a good decentralised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg essential in the future.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) stressed at the inauguration celebrations, the Quartier Office also dedicated itself to the association at the age: "There are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite them to be a regular social meeting."
The social foundation thus made a great contribution to the fact that seniors can live as independently and as well in their familiar environment as possible.
The office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 am to 2 pm, Tuesday and Thursday from 4 am to 6 pm and Saturday from 10 am to 12 pm.
Eintracht Bamberg against Würzburg Kickers on October 6
Now it is official: After the date for the FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third-party leader Würzburg Kickers had not yet been set, the 6 October was now set as an appointment.
The meeting of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth final of the Bayerische Football Totopokal against the third-party league FC Würzburg Kickers was now finally terminated.
It is played on Tuesday, October 6, at 19: 00 in the Bamberger Fuchsparkstadium.
"We are glad that we now know when the game is going over the stage, now we have planning security," says FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the pre-sale of the card that is now launched.
It's a special thing for our team to play against a third-party member.
We therefore hope for many viewers, and not for no reason, because flood-light games have a special attraction.
In 2010, FC Eintracht Bamberg moved into the round of the last 16 teams by winning the district ligist 1. FC Oberhaid (3: 1) and at home against the regional ligist 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3: 2).

Vienna architect Karl Mang died 92 years old
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Vienna's architecture, is dead.
He died on 5 September at the age of 92, as the artist's house reported on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Kunstlerhaus loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna," as it was said in the broadcast.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the University of Technology in Vienna with Friedrich Lehmann during and after World War II.
Since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect, but also worked as a teacher, writer and institute director.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Formation.
In the 1980s he was entrusted with the establishment of the treasury in the Vienna Hofburg and the conversion of the Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theatre Museum.

According to his own statement, he has added 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the last two years.
He didn't do it intellectually.
Wiese was just cut his hair in the city centre of Bremen when he saw a car park guard outside issuing a ticket for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Meadow then stormed out of business, insulted the official and threw the due fine at her feet, as the "Bild" newspaper reports.
The city of Bremen is confirmed by the allegations, but is not yet aware of the consequences for the unusual incident.
"The matter is still under examination," says the city of Bremen.
Only then will it be decided whether to show meadow or not.
Panama authorities destroy 4500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the rainforest-typical climate of Isla del Rey are well suited for the flowering of the marijuana plants.
For three days, the Panamas authorities have been taking out the 4500 plants and burning them.
Men fight on 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses are looking for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday night, around 11: 45, three young men were on foot from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghanistan, according to the police, followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to be waiting for him.
At that time, the group was at the height of the bft gas station.
There were also three people on the gas station.
One of these men now screamed at the young man and smashed him in the face with his fist.
The victim suffered a nasal fracture and was bleeding out of the nose.
When his two friends hastened and enraged on the bat, he first let go of his victim.
The injured young man was now brought home by his friends.
The unsub followed the group with a car up to their apartment and drove by there demonstratively several times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured man went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the bat and another male person.
With the help of a baton, the victim's face and thighs were beaten.
The injured person had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there's only a vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about six feet tall.
The second bat was about 1.65 meters tall and was clothed with a jeans and a brown and white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and sources to report under the telephone number 06181 / 100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice of field houses and invests 310000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongill and Frank Müller (from the left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
This is also welcomed by Samtgemeintürgermeister Bernd Bormann, economic promoter Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf's mayor Heinfried Kabbert.
In many places in the country doctors are missing - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of field houses on October 1.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retiring, her husband Karl-Heinrich is still at his successor's side in the next few months with half a position.
After a conversion phase, Müller reopens the practice on 12 October, until then he invests 310000 euros in the premises on St. Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when the Felstehausen met Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongill, who is currently completing her medical training at the Verdener hospital and wants to get into practice next year.
"We were always in the back of our mind that the garbage would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was time, I just called her."
The couple Müller liked the idea of running their own practice in the future in Asendorf.
"The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us," says the 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to meet and accompany the families over the years."
He also sees as an advantage that he will soon be his own boss.
And so one agreed that the garbage companies bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There, the two-time family father Frank Müller also grew up, followed his medical studies in Hanover in several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently a senior doctor in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed as a leading emergency doctor in the district of Diepholz and is engaged in the DRK-readiness Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From September 19, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a home doctor, his wife Ursel (internist) specializes in gastroenterology.
The garbage companies, both internists, want to settle down as a hospital doctor.
"Endoscopy is therefore coming out," says the 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongill.
After the reconstruction, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound tests as well as long-term and load ECGs and need a more speaking room.
In addition, the computer is completely renewed.
A total grant of EUR 50000 will be granted to the garbage companies in the framework of a promotion programme from the district (EUR 25000) and from the Samtgemeinde (EUR 12500) and the municipality (EUR 12500).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is being continued," stresses Samtgemeintürgermeister Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongill, about 2000 patients come to the practice of Felstehausen every quarter, and in the North German average practice there are about 500.
There is another hospital practice in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of the practice taken over by Frank Müller: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy remains in Asendorf.
If no successor had found herself, she would have gone too.
By the way, those who visit Müller's speaking hours continue to look mainly in familiar faces: take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the field houses.
With their farewell, an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"At the beginning we only had two rooms," Ursel Felstehausen remembers grumbling.
After a long time, she feels a little weariness.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will see many patients a lot," says the internist.
Your husband is laughing, "We have a 6000-square-metre property."
"So far, I've always been in the middle of gardening, now that could be different."
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and is happy to travel.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"Now border controls are also being carried out at our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum could do so "of course."
The care and safety of people is at the forefront.
But it is also clear that "it needs clear signals," said the Minister.
People need to know that we do not accept border-free migration flows, even through the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia is considering "Corridor" - Slovenia is refused
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wanted to continue to travel towards Austria and Germany and that it might also be able to build corridors for the refugees.
This was not the case in Laibach, Minister of the Interior, Vesna Györkös Znidar.
The idea of corridors was "absolutely unacceptable," but Slovenia would step up border monitoring, especially in Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, is already heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area.
However, as the Minister stressed, Slovenin does not want to seal its borders for refugees.
"Each EU member must fulfil its obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," said Györkos Znidar.
As the Croatian government said, the first refugees would have tried to pass in East Croatia at the border crossing of Tovarnik / Sid in the night hours of Tuesday to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to take them in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly arriving in the Croatian Tovarnik since then.
It was mainly about Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Also rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the coming days, his country will count about 4000 refugees, said Minister of the Interior Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be redirected to Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media in agreement on Wednesday.
The government in Belgrade, however, argued that it was to instruct people to take certain routes: "We cannot, nor will we do so," it said.
In any case, according to the media reports, a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the morning, and more buses were expected in the course of the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been on the way all night from the Macedonian border, about 500 km away, through Serbia.
"We have heard that Hungary has closed, so the police told us to go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to continue to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
This could actually lead to a slightly further west route, as observers have already predicted, of the current Balkan route of Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary.
Croatia: "Comprehensive possibilities for border control"
Croatia's Minister of the Interior, Ostojic, had previously stressed that in the event of a strong influx of refugees, his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations.
He did not mention details, but he pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, has "comprehensive possibilities for border control."
Strict controls are being carried out to qualify for membership of the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a member of this group since 2007, and the EU partners have been giving the country a good record of the standard of border controls since then.
On the Serbian side, some 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade's media reports, they would have spent the past night at the border crossing of Horgos, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings between Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
It is still unclear whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border.
The Serbian Minister of the Interior, Nebojsa Stefanovic, tried to calm down on Wednesday morning with a local eye in Horgos: he considered the debate on alternative routes of refugees to be premature after the Hungarian border has now been closed.
This would not be a very high number of refugees at the moment.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers recommend migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugees have already started to distribute to the refugees maps on which alternative routes are registered by Croatia.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe: in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war, still unemptied minefields.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of mine spacers was sent to the border region.
Exchange hackers: Ukrainians pay 30 million dollars
Supranonok is said to have been part of a ring of cyber criminals who are accused of getting an insight into still unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Market Wired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information is to have been used to make insider transactions on the financial markets.
According to the investigators, a total of over 100 million dollars were collected.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are eventually caught," says the SEC Communication.
The trials against 32 other accused persons in the case continued.
Most of the defendants are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical hospice aid Mannheim has existed for 20 years
There is a strong operation around the Mannheim Paradeplatz.
People take care of their concerns, sometimes fast steps, sometimes cozy bumbling.
They control the two stations of the Mannheim car salon at the Paradeplatz.
We have to stop the city's railways.
Pulsing, prall life with beautiful autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four large plates each with the heading "Before I die I want to die...."
The ecumenical hospice aid brought this action to the attention of its 20-year existence and is faced with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the ecumenical hospice help is available to the passers as well for questions and discussions as the volunteers.
While some passersby spontaneously takes to the chalk and read the sentence for "my life," "can", "drive the camper through the US," "stop the war" or "not long suffer," others remain short, read, say phrases like "I'm not yet so far" and then go on.
On the edge, small discussions on the action itself, on life, on how to deal with death are constantly developing.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
"Only if I realize that the end will come to me in this world at some point, I can live responsibly," says the director of the Diaconian work of Mannheim, which is, together with the Caritas Association, the bearer of ecumenical hospice aid.
That is why this 20-year-old public action was good.
The fact that not everyone wanted to be publicly informed on the tables is understandable, but it was a very personal thing.
The subject of death and death is still subject to taboos, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospice movement in recent years has made a great contribution to people opening up.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and mourning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Through personal experience faced with the subject, she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in the help of death.
When the ecumenical hospice aid sought volunteers by call, she immediately came forward and was present at the foundation in 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who are involved and members of households, hospitals, nursing homes and the hospice of Saint Vincent.
All of them are carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can handle her task and the experiences and experiences she has made.
"I see the life of another wait, think it's precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the outpatient ecumenical hospice service is free of charge and independent of confessions.
The financial support of the health insurance funds and donations from family and associations allows the training and training and supervision of the death and mourning companions.
Training for new employees is offered every two years.
The tables described on Saturday are now shown in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There too, further personal wishes can be noted on postcards.
FedEx result mixed, financial prospects for 2016 reduced
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, and the Liefer-Gigant reduced its profit outlook to a whole year because of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At that time last year, FedEx announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The share fell over 2.5 percent in the premarket trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the financial year that ends next May, 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts were expecting $10.84 according to a survey by FactSet.
The lower outlook comes despite the price increases, which are on average 4.9% and will take effect on 4 January and despite higher charges for land transport of heavy and large packages, which will be raised from November.
The company said that it was still expected that the result would increase as compared to the previous year due to lower costs, higher revenues and growth in online trade.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "provides solid revenues when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
The plans for the holiday employment were announced one day later than that of the rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter that ended on August 31, FedEx made $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
The result per share was $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share, which predicted twelve analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six of Zacks interviewed analysts expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decrease in international priority shipping in recent years, which has stagnated the turnover in its Express shipping unit.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, land transport sales increased by 29 percent, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result fell due to higher labour costs in the freight business.
In the premarket trade, about an hour before the opening, the FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11.
At their most expected meeting in the year, Federal Reserve Stravoor spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahogoni table to decide whether it is time for the first time in almost a decade to raise the central interest rate.
Threatened above them at an end of the decorated two-storey meeting hall is a wall of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the Fed President Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are to put the economic interests of the nation before all other things.
The Central Bank has a double mission from Congress: to keep the maximum of US employment and prices stable here.
But since the big recession, the Fed leaders have recognised that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too close to predict it. It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be weaned by the unprecedented incentive of the short-term interest rate that is close to zero since the end of 2008.
Although most of the economic data show that it is growing in a solid way, the recent turbulence in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed representatives afraid to increase this volatility by increasing the interest rate on federal bonds - even by a quarter of a point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they see," said Lindsey M. Piegza, head economist at the real estate company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed is going to do, what itself is uncovering the financial market.
About half of the economists recently interviewed by Bloomberg have predicted a rise in interest rates this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to wait, with a key indicator showing only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decrease in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate unless the strategists reduce the impact by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16.599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy will continue this week, said John Lonski, head economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed lifted the sentences at that time, "he said.
If it does, "it should go very far in its statement to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic."
Other experts argued that a interest rate increase would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty as to when the Fed will act.
A month ago, the Fed seemed in a good way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US.
In spring and early summer, Yellen had said that this year, despite the complaints of Liberals, it would expect an increase in the rate of economic progress.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level the Fed considers to be full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can manage higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, head economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world came together at the end of last month after China had devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16% below its peak in May, when investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would reduce global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now almost 10% below the high in May.
For the Fed representatives, market turbulence has an impact on the complex calculation of when interest should be increased.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would be attracted to this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Notenbank.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least a month to better control the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be, and there is almost no reliable data that describe developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed monetary authority has become the world.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication of the then head Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "narrow" its monetary expansion caused confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interlinked, the Fed representatives can be expected to monitor developments not only elsewhere, but also to consult with other central banks and experts in order to get a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for asset management of the company Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreaction to financial market movements that are apparently not linked to economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who is working to increase interest rates, cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its central interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "despite limited visible effects on growth in the US," said Lacker.
A year later, the Fed representatives reversed these cuts.
The Fed should only be the first to place aspects of financial stability during a serious crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England interest rate-fixing committee.
The recent turbulence does not come near this level, he said.
"She certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest rates because the markets are getting up," said Pozsen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until this is changed, I do not think it should go ahead.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown, not Thai Town.
The market / stock is a central contact point and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need engine oil.
The store is huge, and it takes over an hour to walk through the corridors.
If all the shopping makes you hungry, there is a meal in the LAX-C BBQ Express for you.
The kitchen (good and inexpensive) in this store is close to the checkout and has various take-away options.
What is there here: Do you need anything - something - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are cheap and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and fileate the fish and even fry for you on request.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezer department. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melons and gallant, whole ducks, fish, cattle blood and bile, pigs-natural intestines, fish balls, regional sausages, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and cooks, also individual families and individuals.
The wide corridors are suitable for shopping cars and forklifts.
You will find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the register.
Where it is located: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking lot.
Hoyerswerda: Small life support for refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany these days.
To give you a warm welcome, does not go without the commitment of countless volunteers.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerswerda who support non-profit asylum seekers in the city.
Among them are Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She still likes to teach with her 74 lenses.
She does it every Thursday at the asylum-seekers' home on Dillinger Street.
There it helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is quite different from a proper school.
Brazil's Paediatric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast-feeding
The Brazilian Paediatric Organisation SPRS is trying to tell women in a shocking way how important good nutrition is during breast-feeding. It is doing this by presenting pictures of babies who suck on breasts painted with unhealthy food.
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calcium intake by about 500 calories a day.
However, new research results suggest that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, Professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can have a negative effect on the immune system.
Exemptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The municipality of Bernried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may become flat for solar system.
The plans for the long-awaited gymnastics building on the Bernrieder sports grounds are progressing step by step: in the recent municipal council meeting, the work of the building application was unanimously approved without great discussions.
In the past, the body had decided, among other things, to apply for an "exemption" from the applicable construction plan.
The "exception" was about permission for a special form with regard to the roof construction.
This means that a "saddle roof with a non-middle first and roof superstructure" is to be built.
The background to the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar installations: "This brings us together a wonderful large south roof," said Mayor Josef Steugenberger in the meeting.
The "exemption" was again about the roof slope, which is to be below 10 degrees for energy reasons, other than those required by the construction plan.
The volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced.
A "exemption" was therefore necessary because the construction plan does not allow "exceptions" to the roof, with the Berrieder Gemederrat usually being more restrictive in the case of applications for exemption.
However, it is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent with this," says Steigenberger.
The Turnhalenbau at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
The cost is estimated at around 2.3 million euros.
Grants are expected from school and wide-ranging sports.
In the next step of the procedure, the building application for the 18 x 36 m hall is now submitted to the Landrat Office for examination.
Klinik Peißenberg is moving to Schongau
The hospital Peißenberg is to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes new medical director at Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of the employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is what the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district, confirmed by the Landrat Andrea Jochner-Weiß.
However, the Supervisory Board made a decision on this, and it will be meeting next Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans were to be implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to work.
The vast majority were to move with fishermen and the still existing internal station to Schongau.
The rooms were available.
The employees who cannot go to Schongau are to be offered a job in Weilheim, according to Jechner-Weiß.
The staff were informed about the plans.
The change has triggered the resignation of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been the medical director of the Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and has now changed to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
According to Jechner-Weiß, the name "Fischer," who agreed to take the lead from 1 October, came into play with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau this meant in any case a "upgrade" and a widening of the offer in the area of "internal medicine," according to Jechner-Weiß.
Fischer is a specialist in pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastrointestinal diseases at the inner station.
In the course of the next two years, if the Supervisory Board agrees, Fischer will lead both houses until next year the former hospital of the Knappschaft, which still has 35 beds, is finally closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
To date, the district had planned this for 2018 when the current rehabilitation at the Weilheim hospital was completed.
Landrättin Jechner-Weiß, who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board, met with rumours that the House, which is in possession of the Federal Alliance, will be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future.
"I rule out that." As the property continues, Jechner-Weiß could not say there are several considerations.
At present there are a short-term care of the Caritas and a day psychiatry.
"What was better could not happen to us, such an opportunity did not come again," said Fischer, via the quasi-move to the Lech, which had been taken up by the employees "positive and very understanding."
There has not been a real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as a chef for over 30 years.
He was asked by Mr Schongauer to take over the position of the Medical Director.
The hospital Peißenberg (once 100 beds) has been threatened with closure over the past decades, departments have been closed, for example surgery and birth aid.
The hand players of the Rhein-Neckar lions are required tonight (8.15 pm) at the mountain HC.
The table leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favorite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason to be overjoyed.
In the last season, the Baders had a painful defeat at the BHC and have something to do with it.
Hunting accident with two injured at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their May harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the fall on a maize field near Pratau (Wittenberg district) several hunters were in use, as the police reported.
After a shot, a 63- and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
How exactly the accident could come about was unclear at first.
The criminal police are investigating.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate victims of violence
A suspect has led the police to the body of the 16-year-old missing from Rhineland-Palatinate since Saturday.
In the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the young people and throwing their bodies into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate, missing since Saturday, has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday night in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, as public prosecutor and police reported on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old, also arrested on Tuesday night, is considered to be a suspect, who confessed to the fact and led the investigators to the location of the body.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home on the eve of a visit to a autumn party in Rockenhausen as agreed.
In the search for the young woman, the investigators first met the victim's personal objects.
In the case of interviews in the group of missing persons, there was a case-by-case investigation against the 20-year-old.
The suspect then led the police to a channel in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the authorities, the prisoner admitted that he had killed the 16-year-old and put the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old was to be brought to the judge on Wednesday, the investigators put a lot of slaying on him.
The further investigation is to be carried out in the light of the circumstances of the action.
Refugees need accommodation: study warns against housing gap
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for a affordable stay.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have long begun.
With the incoming refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing to a market that is already overloaded in many major cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable apartments.
To meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020.
This is the result of a study commissioned by the Social Housing Association.
For comparison: This year, 260,000 units will be completed in Germany.
This means that 140,000 apartments are missing.
Refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial reception accommodation after the first three months of their stay.
Many then enter the housing market and get into the long snakes in front of the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, in the last year less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees.
The study is also a major failure in the housing policy of recent years.
Germany is pushing ahead with a housing deficit, which is growing from year to year.
At present, around 770,000 housing units have been missing in the metropolitan areas, and Matthias Günther, author of the study, is complaining.
Many of the workers therefore lived in large cities in WG rooms.
Young adults were unwillingly staying at the "Hotel Mama" because of the flute on the housing market.
In the large cities, the number of square meters per head has fallen for the first time in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the "Social Housing" Alliance proposes a new start.
The aim is to bring new incentives back to social housing.
In this way, the basic labour market tax could be waived and the property tax for supported housing suspended for a limited period of time.
In addition, according to the Alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are needed.
The programme for the promotion of refugee accommodation at the State Bank KfW is already well on the way to cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start of the project, with 184 million euros on Monday night, more than half of the around 300 million euros available had been made available.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees are free: Croatia and Slovenia set up a corridor
After Hungary, there is practically no way of getting through, as more and more refugees are taking the road over Croatia.
Zagreb announced that it would allow the transit through Slovenia to the north without any hurdles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to agree with the neighbouring country Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken to the Slovenian Minister of the Interior, and if it is necessary, we will organise a corridor," said Croatian Minister of the Interior Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have left for Croatia to get from there to Western Europe.
500 people had crossed the border with Tovarnik, reported the Croatian television station RTL.
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees the day before.
New laws, which came into force on the same day, also make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary practically superfluous.
Croatia wants to let the refugees happen.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel through and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are here, there are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, they were people who did not want to live in Croatia.
In the morning, the Croatian police took on the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU's neighbouring country Croatia.
According to most media reports, they came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both by bus and by taxi to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not encounter border fences.
The border strip has other dangers for this: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
The aim is to create a safe passage quickly.
However, after the closure of the border, there are hardly any more refugees to Hungary.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people arrested.
Just before the gate closed on Monday it had been 9380.
The new Hungarian laws classify the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a crime.
In the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged, 35 criminal proceedings were initiated.
The convicted are under arrest for up to five years and the deportation from the country.
According to the Immigration Authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established "transit zones," of which almost all - 93 - are the most important transition in Röszke.
Among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning, there would have been 40 refugees there.
In practice, however, no one has a chance to get asylum in Hungary.
In the Hungarian view, Serbia is a "safe third country."
The rejection of asylum seekers is to be dropped there.
There were only a few hundred refugees before the "Transseitone" in Röszke.
In Röszke workers began to clean up.
They collected the trash that tens of thousands of people left at the edge of the road in the past few weeks.
Sperrgitters were dismantled and one of the reception managers in the border area was rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the objective of this change.
Austria has only a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
But about 20,000 migrants were still in the country, according to government.
In Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for a further trip to Germany.
The train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instructions of German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drove "Strangled" across the border
"We were busy cleaning up after the bridge party on Sunday, when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent with travel offerings," says Wegenheine Mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they were going to Passau by train.
However, because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow, it was in Wernstein that it ended, "said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and drove the people who were killed along with two other helpers and their cars across the border to the near Passau.
Before that, we first served the unhoped guests, with jusses and drinks.
We said we'd take her to Passau by car.
"That was for us, of course," said Stadler in the OÖN conversation.
You were very grateful.
A man could not take it to give a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire department.
"We were very pleased," says Stadler.
On Sunday night in Wels, the stranded train passengers had moved from an ICE to a regional train towards Passau to try to cross the border after the short-term announcement that the rail transport to Germany was stopped.
However, the regional train was abandoned before the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border is generally high in the course.
The Brückenfest connected with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday, the days before a two-bridge run sporty - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán is sending us more thousands is a logical result of a seemingly sacred policy:
Instead of helping immediately in the Röszke camp to establish structures that guarantee humanity, our Chancellor has put the Hungarian government's position in the dark circle of National Socialism in a highly official and public way.
The suffering of this policy is not only those Austrians who are now facing chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees will also have to see that the "promised land" that they have invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge, given the continuing flows of refugees and the near winter, to create decent conditions for those seeking protection.
And it will be even greater - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35,000 winter-proof quarters
Konrad has all hands full with the refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is used to his word having weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos at the first reception centre of Traiskirchen has already got Konrad under control.
"We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen," he reported about his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was also done without great vortex, Konrad said and praised the organizational "master performance."
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a "critical situation."
In total, Konrad expects a need of 85,000 quarters in the year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 more accommodations will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to provide the countries, 15,000 of the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can make it.
"But it's not a barrel without ground," Konrad said.
He has already had talks with the heads of state.
These would have assured him to create quarters for the coming refugees.
"It's going well in Upper Austria," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-Mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, to clarify how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also places great expectations in the ORF action "Help like us."
On the platform, private individuals can offer easy accommodation.
In addition, we hope for hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticised the standards for accommodation as "very high."
In times of emergency, it could not be that quarters have to respect a certain height of the towel holders or the size of the upper lights.
For a limited period of time, "emergency standards" should apply.
In contrast to the Ministry of the Interior, he is more successful in the accommodation, and Konrad is the reason for his experience.
I am an older Lord, to whom one does not say the untruth to the face without further ado.
Convincing power was his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cost the Republic, as they themselves explained.
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four.
Its own quartersearch has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Stephan Square as an office.
But there are obviously problems with the approval.
Linz calls for a better distribution
For the time being, no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips arena and design center for the accommodation of refugees is planned by the city of Linz.
This is not necessary at the moment, as it is currently possible to accommodate those concerned without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, in the event of an emergency, further locations will be checked for their suitability.
The head of the city is critical of the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts must also make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "Limits will not be locked down"
In a longer phone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), the State Captain Josef Pühringer (VP) recorded on Monday the further action on the refugee issue.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders will not be sealed.
The continued movement of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany was still possible.
However, the relevant border controls are now in place.
Special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist for the time being.
However, the search for protection would be brought to Germany with regular trains.
From the other EU Member States, Pühringer once again called for increased solidarity on the refugee issue.
The fact that Austria is now introducing controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" for Pühringer from the actions of the Germans.
The next runtastic is a question of time
The general renovation of the "New shipyard" in the Linz Industrial Line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the listed IT group S & T has moved in, the rest (2700 square meters) is to be rented to young, innovative technology companies.
"In IT, the smart heads are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us," says S & T chief Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in the new yard's start-up companies and later acquiring some.
From the beginning, S & T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - something that Niederhauser promises: "The next runtastic is only a matter of time."
EUR 1.7 million was invested in the site by S & T, EUR 3.3 million from the Techcenter, which is one third of the city of Linz, the country of Upper Austria and the Federal Government (FFG).
The building is rented by Linz AG for 60 years to S & T and Techcenter.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters of the remaining area in the building are already rented, for another 40 percent there are requests.
Lia-Peroni-holder opened second shop in the arcade
The new shop will focus on Furla handbags.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to get a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the Taubenmarkt-Arcade had to move this project in a short time: after all, she has now been given an increase in the form of another business place.
In the Furla shop opposite the business where she sells bags, bags, shoes and clothes of different manufacturers, everything is now about Furla's women's handbags, wallet is available from 75 euros.
Bigger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
A number of weeks ago, it was rebuilt.
"But I've been thinking for a long time whether to open another shop," says Breit.
The decision was based on the fact that the Furla producers who are at home in Bologna were also affected by the idea of their own location where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the Linz area who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters who even have Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been put in the cradle by her mother.
I'm the most appropriate thing to do when something is developing and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why so many women, when looking at a beautiful purse, can not answer the expert with the last chance.
Maybe it's because a nice bag revaluates every outfit.
The Brutljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Pfälzer ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called anchors.
This property also connects some with the billionaire who wants to be US President.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for upsets.
Whether he is a foreign-enemy, a journalist or a lack of knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office is a strong player in the campaign.
And cut it off well.
This is also recorded in the Pfalzian Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate millionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the hair hairstyle is a term for many in the wine village on the wine road.
Some people in the 1200-inhabitants place are related to him.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in the campaign mode.
The cold town of Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find this kind of exciting, but they are not so deeply impressed in their kind of cold town," says Simone Wendel.
The native Kallstadt has made an amusing documentary about the place and its famous proverbs, which includes the Ketchup family Heinz, in addition to Trump.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, is also mentioned in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He didn't bring it to the King of the Hearts.
While there is respect for the performance of the family, there is also a tendency to believe that Trump is "a bit of a big mouth," says Wendel.
By chance, the nickname that Kallstadt has in the area, "The Brutljesmacher" - to high-German: the adversaries, she says.
So Trump is from the village of the owners.
The Trump's success story began in 1885, when the later grandfather emigrated and in the US opened a place for gold graves.
The real estate company's first real estate purchases were in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free from Tragik: their desire to return to their homes in the long term failed in the Bavarian state to which the Palatinate belonged at that time.
He did not take Trump because he had once left without permission, the director of the Institute of Pfalcian History and Volkskunde, Roland Paul, had declared the start of the film.
Trump was the grandson of an "illegal emigrants."
This is in contrast to the sometimes marked statements of the descendant.
He had repeatedly spoken in vain about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"As the padded, this is not as sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative trump ("The grandmother was a born trump, the grandpa was born Heinz").
The winemaker in retirement sees the American more distant, "he's always so upsetting."
Does he think Trump's coming?
"I can't imagine," says the 72-year-old.
"He never took care of Kallstadt."
The pension manager, Veronika Schramm, mentioned like some Kallstadter, that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which was generally well received.
"I can't imagine that from the Donald," says the 68-year-old.
They would like it better if he did not win the election, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's good."
If those who were in charge at the time of his grandfather in the United States had been like him, "he would never have arrived there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzerdaughter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
"It's not my president," she says.
And, "The grapes will be ripe without the President Trump."
Wendel's film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12,000 cinema singers, and in the USA, too, the interest awakens.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "Bergsteigerdorf."
From the hands of the Vice-President at the German Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-inhabitants village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
In Austria there are already 20 "Bergsteigerdörfer."
In the neighbouring country, the Alpenverein is responsible for the award of the award.
A "Bergsteigerdorf" may have a maximum population of 2500.
At least one fifth of its area shall be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the reviews, despite the attempts of Nine to take over the loss of leadership at today's show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson are moving to Canberra to report after the loss of the leadership of the Liberals, but it has not made any major changes in today's reviews.
The breakfast show of Nine was broadcast by the capital when Malcolm Turnbull managed to overthrow Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise, with the moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a one-week series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance did not seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise achieved an average of 397,000 spectators in the five capitals, compared to today 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number was lower than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, today reached an average of 318,000 compared to the 330,000 Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers at today's 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change concern these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the check!

The great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father, who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Raffers Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night was a clear "yes."
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.136 million viewers and slightly hit The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results at night two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17: 00 to 17: 30) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, showed an average of 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17: 30 to 18: 00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's hot seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 spectators and in the second half hour sat 720,000.
Hot-Seat on average 620,000.
The fall in the quotas for the second evening of The Chase Australia will be confident that Nine will eventually be able to win the Hot-Seat at 5: 30.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that failed to overrun the McGures show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly shown who wins The Bachelor.
The woman that Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor was covered in the greatest secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three become two, you may have accidentally given an indication of who the winner will be.
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
All three women have lyrically ruled out why Wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked, "If not you, who should get Woods's last rose?," their answers could become the player who won the Bachelor's heart.
Jevons-Fellows and Markoski both quickly called Mackay the best partner for Wood, except for themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship from the first day.
"From the moment I went into the house and noticed (Sarah's) and Sam's energies, I felt they were pretty compatible, and I thought that all over the show," said Jevons-Fellows.
"Sarah stands with both feet on the earth, it's so much fun to be with her," added Markoski.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said that the house visit last week made her realize that Wood could be "the One."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and the family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now unreservedly set on him," she said.
And when she was asked who to choose Wood, if not her, she was mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls as well - it's an indecision between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday, 7: 30 pm, on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent questions after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a smart decision.
Some coaches would have banished Hayne to the bank for the rest of the game when he lost a rumor as the Aussie Rugby League convertible did at his first point return on Tuesday at the 20-3 win against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next chance to a point return and also to the ongoing game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the changing cabin after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies through the mill before the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne in his post-game press conference.
The 49s sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his ruined catch and to take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne pattts at a point that was restored in the first part of the game by the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian pursuit had hoped for his NFL debut.
After the Fumble, Hayne left the field and later told the Australian radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his NFL career,
"This was a thing that happens, you only take care of the next game, and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer with his original debut in 2007 when a pass in his own in-Goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans and held an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss the rights of the gay
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested in a Siberian field with arms force.
After he had openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was sentenced to confiscate his oil company Yukos and to stop his democratic efforts.
The Free Electors call for the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees.
Party and group leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW autumn cloak in Großwallstadt about a serious crisis in Bayern's schools, if there are not enough new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from the collapse," said Aiwanger.
"Otherwise, we will get distortions in the Bavarian education system."
The country-day group of free voters will meet until Friday in the underground commune.
In fact, quite different main issues were planned.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Elector Meeting.
"Of course, the issue of asylum will overlay the lair," said Aiwanger.
Aivanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as they were during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s.
"This is no longer the case, we have to go to the causes," said the Free Elector Chief.
Rejected asylum seekers want to push off the free voters as soon as possible.
That is why Aiwanger also asked for more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum complaints: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW leader criticised that several federal states were not consistent: "We need uniform federal standards across the country."
"Bavaria is pushing off, others are not."
"We need to be more effective."
But the country policy in Großwallstadt should not fall under the table.
A year-long permanent burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Kultusminister Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) has launched a pilot "middle level plus" at 47 high schools, where an extension of the secondary school level is tested from three to four years - as a result it will take another nine years to graduate.
But that doesn't go far enough for Aiwanger.
"The issue of G9 needs to be accelerated," said the FW Chief.
We demand freedom of choice for all high schools who want it.
Free drive at the G9 wherever it is desired.
Festere Wall Street helps Dax jump
The German stock market has closed with profits after a long-distance, unfocused and nervous trade.

In the United States, the Dow Jones index last recorded about 1 percent in the plus.
Many stock exchanges expect that the markets will be on the spot until after the US interest rate decision and also for the large fall on the futures on this Friday.
In the meantime, the discussion about the burden from the nuclear exodus has pushed RWE's shares to a record deep and left deep traces even in the case of Eon.
According to "Spiegel," the German energy companies may lack EUR 30 billion in provisions.
The Federal Government rejected the figures mentioned in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat, but in the end lost 3.31 percent (RWE) and 6.15 percent (Eon).
Infineon shares increased by a further 3.22 percent at the Dax top.
According to a dealer, a positive report from the US investor magazine "Barron's" worked from the weekend.
As a result, investors currently paid too little attention to the German chipbuilder.
The investment in future-rich wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off.
Car values were required: Even in the traditionally weak summer month of August, more cars were sold again than in the previous year, as the industry association Acea reported on the launch of the International Automotive Exhibition IAA in Frankfurt.
The papers of the car builders Daimler and BMW increased by 1.34 percent and 2.21 percent respectively.
Volkswagen's benefits were at 1.26 percent.

4 people killed after police shoot rubber shots at demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber shots into a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution, said an official on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday night in the district of Rupanvehi, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the chief district officer, said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then shot it in the air before it used rubber shots.
20 police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber shots used, which are known to be able to kill, but which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern levels, where members of the ethnic group of the Madhesi say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been involved in violent disputes since the 10th
The four major political parties were killed in August, when they signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally ruled for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the draft Constitution in Kathmandu, and officials said that the new Constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The property at the Emder Jugenzentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt again.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meters area.
A mixture of trade, business and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a plot of about 4000 square meters in a direct neighborhood to the youth center Alte Post.
The preparations for this are currently under way.
It is planned to use the site for a mixture of trade, business and housing.
You are waiting for the appropriate offers, it is said by the city.
It is not yet clear which investor is to be considered.
In this respect, no contracts had been concluded.
The city of Emden had already bought a part of the property located on the Ringstraße / corner of Great Street a few months ago and had the building on it demolished.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home settlement at the Small Sea at Emden take shape.
The investor presented for the first time public plans for the project.
Some of the residents are still worried - they are afraid of selling out their leisure reunion
For months, behind closed doors had been negotiated, greeted, debated and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday home in the small sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized enterprise "system construction," presented his plans in the Council's urban development committee on Monday night for the first time.
This item was originally on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP Group, who called on the investor and the administration of the secret business, Ralf Behrens went from the system-building management to the offensive: "We do not yet have an answer to all the questions," he said to the members of the Council and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to meet all the rumors now.
The EUR 10 to 12 million project has been under discussion for months.
The pictures and new details for the desired hotel construction were the result of a serious reaction among sea-bed owners who had come to the meeting.
Roberto Schulz, Meerboden owner and member of the board at the interest of the Anlieger, Pro Hieve, complains: "This is going to be a huge piece of shit that overlooks all the other buildings."
He also fears, like many other project critics, that the intended size of the plant would increase the traffic significantly: "There must be whole bus loads to make this count," says Schulz.
What is happening exactly on the well one hectare area of the former restaurant is still open.
There is no operator yet.
"First we must have a coherent concept," said Ralf Behrens.
Because this was still missing, the construction plans were still variable.
Two-year-olds at Gorillas in the Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is happy about its young people with its gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins yesterday.
Gemini births are rare in gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo is almost 50 years ago and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, it is said by the zoo.
The sex of the newborn gorilla twins is not yet established, as Mother Dian keeps them close to the body.
First the "picture" had reported.
NHC predicts 60% chance for Cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands
On Tuesday, the US National Hurricane Center predicted a wide low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde islands, which has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low-pressure system, such as in the middle between the Cape Verde islands and the small Antilles, also has a 60% potential to form a tropical cyclone over the next two days, added the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google launches double-donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL. O) announced a double-donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organisations to help thousands of refugees who have overrun the European nations as they are fleeing from the war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusual personal approach to the announcement of the donation call on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
"Our journey included many dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants: doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations will be doubled to $11 million up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com / refugeerrelig.
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven over 4 million people this year.
Many also fled from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya, which was torn by the war.

Weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly overweight diabetics.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data need a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote an article on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight-loss operations or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgery has been effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people who are ill-fed with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain amount of weight in terms of size, is considered to be normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI of over 30 are considered to be fat.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they have collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and gastric ulcer formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained approximately the same in those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments at 29.
Among those undergoing surgical surgery, the diabetes disease was completely dissolved in 36% and in 28%.
In the medically treated group, diabetes was completely dissolved at only one percent and in part at only about two percent.
In addition, the results in the control of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the 'surgical' group," the authors found out.
The researchers also monitor the patient blood level of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects the blood sugar levels over time.
Haemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the operation, the average haemoglobin A1c level decreased from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the medical treatment group it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycaemic control" - as you are reflected in the improved haemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to the leading researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results for the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gas rectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved major decreases in the BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and had more of a complete survival of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, Blackstone from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix says.
In the Swedish study, it was about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years in the case of fat-bearing people undergoing an obesity operation, compared to a group that tried to use more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgical patients, Blackstone said it was soothing for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," she said, without an increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have collected these genetic changes that have firmly connected their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really difficult. "
Love story plays in the Hunsrück
It is a subject that is currently more in the field of belletristics: a young woman, unpopular and untenable at school, meets again after years the bosom of her youth, and he falls in love with her.
So also in the recently published novel "Actually we are not like this" by Luisa Binder.
In addition to the love history, the novel should be especially interesting for Hunsrücker readers, because it plays in the weiler and the surrounding villages.
The main professional author grew up in Weweiler and is pleased that she was able to set a literary monument to her home town.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not accept all the refugees, the Dalai Lama said and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan-Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in the home countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He called for the interests of humanity to be placed in front of the interests of individual nations or even continents in the circumstances.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, the situation was not appropriate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"To take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime, you have to think about long-term solutions, how to create real peace and real development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's action after the terrorist attack of September 11, and pointed out that the US's violent response was a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in the lack of violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that has caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increase in the use of hand disinfectants by children in the last 4 years
Toxic control centres in the US report an almost 400% increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow highly alcoholic hand disinfectants, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Georgia Poison Center, the cases of income from hand infections in children under 12 years of age reporting poison control centres increased from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"Children get to these products more and more often, and unfortunately a percentage of them go to the emergency room," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectants intentionally, while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mother sample in the social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Young people have allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcohol-containing oral water to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive scents of the disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand-disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange fragrance that are very attractive for children.
Hand disinfectants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol somewhere.
Especially for young children, a few syringes can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison emergency centre in the hospital of the University of Kansas, the Fox 4 station in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn't let a sip of whisky stand around, but people leave these hand-disinfectants in the reach of children, and when kids get there, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four sprites of hand-disinfectant scented in the school after strawberry, was taken to an emergency.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold that is legally considered drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who treated her in the Gwinnet Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah read her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors watch her overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had hit her head, said Ritchey.
"That was very frightening," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijahs mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and store hand disinfectants outside the child's reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand disinfectants containing a toxic, unexplained ingredient.
Health authorities' staff suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal solution instead of ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three fourth-class students in the state of New York planned to poison their "mean" teacher by explaining antibacterial products around the classroom, "it reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and exiled them from her room.
The police considered the plan to be "chatter" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged

The lack of title competition in Scottish football boring Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers midfielder and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador to Ajax, said: "In the Netherlands they no longer show highlights of Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't here.
People here are not just talking about the Rangers coming back.
You're talking about the Old Firm.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the Old Firm games, and it is not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm gonna turn things around, Deila swears.

Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel that way, but we have to move on.
We really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better.
It's so important to get together now.
Warburton careful at January transfers

The ex-boss of Brentford said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you saw with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.

Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged between May and July at 164,000, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9% was higher than that of the UKs of 5.5%, as the figures of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed.
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent over the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
The Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy."

Why I will witness an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will watch a man get killed.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in an audience gallery in the death room in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation took place for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
When the day came closer, I began to fear.
So why would I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the United States, and as there are often more applications than places available, a more macabre lottery takes place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
If you are selected, you will see it without emotion.
I can't do this.
I will be sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with calls and a two and a half hour visit.
I like this guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of giving up my impartiality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it, and you get access.
I was complaining to her.
She admitted that she "could have put it better," but she still thinks it's wrong what I do.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He won't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I told him he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
If he dies, he thinks that the public relations work of the movement against the death penalty will help.
Kim Bellware, a reporter at the Huffington Post, will be sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I made.
I don't want to go back to all the details here.
I can't be sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there's a strong chance he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I'll see him die.
I can't say I'm really objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can turn.
What you're gonna get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man after wet police chase persuaded to come out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale police officer remained dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in the shallow and swamped water, just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "gently persuade him to return to the shore."
The Canning Vale police were called on Tuesday to a house-break incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He was standing in the water and said 'I'm not coming out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too excited about making his uniform wet, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good cop negotiates."
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Master football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousin's car went into the ditch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousin biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that stewards tried to spy on him and threatened to end the race.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables in the past year and threatened to stop the race immediately.
He aimed at the Stewards and the Integrity Division of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the Late Scratching of Lady Tatai for a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cobalt-tupper test at Lidaris that he can't explain.
He had held back for 18 months because of the espionage charges and did not want it to "look like too high-hanging grapes."
"I had no intention of saying anything about it, and I've been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out at once," Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to go around the top, and I want my owners to think that I'm trying my best for them.
If they start to think I'm not doing this, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I'll have to think about what I'm doing with my license.
Previously, Moody had let the bomb go up in an interview with racing.com that the Integrity Department had tried to spy on his stable.
"18 months ago, Terry Bailey, Doyle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - I will name when I'm asked - and offered him an employment in my stables to provide information about what I do within my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.
You seem to think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should certainly get to their noses because they failed in trying to get to me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, President-in-Office of the RVL and Bernard Sauntry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still aware of it today.
Is that supposed to make me think it's going to be personal?
Did the RVL act cowardly and perhaps make people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they have to take my license and break me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying is making them think about it now.
But I have now arrived at the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The frustration levels of the trainer have been built up with the long-lasting cobalt investigation at Lidari, and late Scratching led him to say that he could "throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation of the undefeated Master Black Caviar, called the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or sound was applied to the horse legs, which was contrary to the rules.
"It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this, "he said.
"One of my employees has miserably applied mud on his leg.
It could have been like that last night.
It could have been like that all day yesterday.
But it was like that on the race day.
Moody could be faced with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the package on the race day. An investigation of this matter was opened.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all realize that we need rules, but you've gone too far here," Moody said.
Man arrested after driver's escape
The police arrested a man on the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and then a driver's escape in Cobram.
The cyclist was delivered to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with a helicopter with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on the Murray Valley motorway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver continued without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia came to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with a driver's escape and a lack of assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is staying in the hospital. He is in a stable state.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy is beating back against rivals for claims to ring fights
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has described his players' tackling as "agenda setting" by two Premier League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Rooster's coach Trent Robinson said that the referee allowed the storm players "ring fights" with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Bronco's coach Wayne Bennett made a little cover-up note on the storm team after his team had won the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "model example" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended his team's tacklimg and said that they were only focused on their "contact" when they were tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches on his team was a confident vote, as it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the storm team.
"This always shows up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about ring fights when they hit us 24: 2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed our defensive system or the techniques all year round, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact at Tackles a real focus, and this has provided us with the trend turn.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he's probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny how this always shows up at this time of year.
Bellamy has attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennet's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne is talking about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night with our game on Friday night and how exciting her game was, "said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010, St George was criticised as a boring team, and Wayne said he was gonna take care of this shit.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players at their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his type of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like this.
I'm building greater trust because they say these things because they're a little worried about having to play against us.
They probably didn't think about us six weeks ago when it was about the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against Rooster achieved a higher result than the game Broncos against cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16: 12?
Our game was 20: 18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are there breaks and no points something exciting?
For me, it's the game plans.
When they mention us, it means that we will still meet them at a stage.
The Storm team is free this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks on the next Saturday night in the pre-final at AAMI Park. The ticket sale starts from next Tuesday morning.
Serbier with $200,000 deposit by drug charge
A man who may be threatened with life-long punishment for trying to get into possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released against a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and started in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed meeting his co-defendants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo.
Despite a possible life-long penalty for trying to own a commercial amount of cocaine, the lawyer of Maksimovic argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to own the whole amount and that in the café could have been for a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the risk of escape from Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, "he explained to the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had offered a deposit of $200,000 as security together to achieve his release.
"After reading the statements of the two people, it is clear that the issue of a security of $200,000 is a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But this alone will not be enough to stop him from not appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released against bail, under the conditions that he will issue his Australian and Serbian passport, report to the police every day and stick to a curfew of 18: 00-06: 00.
Accident at A5 near Karlsruhe: the driver's house breaks apart
In the event of an accident with three trucks on the 5 motorway near Karlsruhe, a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday night.
Two of the three trucks involved had stopped in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to avoid the last moment to the left, as the police reported.
The driver's house of the accident-cause broke completely apart.
The driver was seriously injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed for over six hours to 2 o'clock.
There was a damage of 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used phone from girls to lure pedophile to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when it was sleeping, logged in to an online messaging service, from which he received a series of unstanding pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She saw it through, found the confusing reports and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five pictures, then analysed computers found under the address and discovered "relevant" web-research that used terms for the search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he did it because it would lead to "pedophile on the Internet" and then he "pretended to be a cop to scare them."
The prosecutor Eiligh Robertson said to the Dundee Sheriff Court, "he said it was an addiction that he was addicted to frightening people.
He admitted that the search on the computer was carried out by him, but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a police officer to scare pedophile.
He was asked about his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and who he asked to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in his head when he was drinking, and he said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added, "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was trembling and crying.
She also saw the impermanent pictures on the phone and confronted the defendant with it.
The girl was interviewed and said that the defendant used computers and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared guilty in the sense of the indictment that he had taken pictures of children on 14 June last year, that he had violated the conditions on 25 January this year and that he had not appeared in court for a hearing on 24 March this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg does not appear in the register of sexual offenders, as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" is to be found in his crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael moved the verdict until October to get background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody for hearings on other outstanding cases.
He was included in the list of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment.
Schleuser deviate on small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being taken away from the major control points on the German-Austrian border.
Many locks, for fear of discovery and arrest, increased people at smaller border crossings
on the Austrian side, said a spokesman of the Federal Police.
Along the border river Inn, more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and dam pipes.
They are received and forwarded to registration by federal police.
At the Munich Central Station, according to the Federal Police data, there were more refugees again than at the beginning of the week on Wednesday.
By 8: 00 p.m. alone, some 700 people had arrived in the capital city, said a speaker in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls on the German-Austrian border, on Tuesday 1759 refugees had reached the city.
Stuttgart: Exterior of Tropenstorm "Henry" in the southwest expected
Meteorologists warn of storms in the south-west of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low pressure area over Western Europe, hot sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart.
The strong deep was the outflow of the tropical storm "Henry," which had been pulled over the Atlantic from the Bermuda Islands in the past few days.
Heavy storms and thunderstorms are expected mainly in Baden.
According to DWD, even until Thursday morning in the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alb and in the Bodensee district, there are also a number of soils from 60 to 90 hours of the hour.
On Friday the sun can therefore be seen for a longer time.
The mass does it: every two years the car builders at the IAA show their new things.
In 2015, there is mainly movement in the compact cars, which are currently selling very well.
Cars from the compact class are currently in particular demand: around 28.1% of new registrations were made on this segment alone in August, according to the Federal Aviation Office (KBA).
This is also reflected in the IAA (public days 17 to 27 September).
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new high-class and luxury cars, many new compact models are presented this year.
One of the biggest premiere for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be with the dealers in the autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
For the volume model to sell well, the new Astra is not to be much more expensive.
Opel is looking forward to an entry below the largest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW / 100 hp.
The Hessen also offer additional diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp, including three-cylinder petrol for the first time.
Unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is first only available as a five-door driver.
As a second variant, the combi will follow in the spring, which can also be seen on the IAA.
And what is being done next to the Astra at the IAA on new compact cars?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra competitor Mégane to the race.
At the fair, the Mégane can only be seen as a five-door version in a conventional and a highly sporty GT version.
He will be on the trade at the beginning of next year, then also as a combi.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is new in the segment.
With the new model, the Nissan-Amer wants to find its position in the very growing segment.
The compact Infiniti with its curved lines fits fully into the design line of the brand.
The basic model will receive a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp.
The offer also includes a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is the Suzuki Baleno, who is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbocharged engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp.
The maximum torque is 170 Newton meters (Nm) according to the manufacturer.
The start of the Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but all over again the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen at the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble Citroën-Ableiger were especially hand-in-hand at the front: here the cooling grille was redrawn and the modified headlights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was mainly modernised, the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and the first time Apple's CarPlay was integrated.
In addition, at the IAA in the compact class there are a number of revisions and new variants such as the frozen Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are unworthy of human beings
The Federal Constitutional Court has given justice to an ex-prisoner of the Tegel District Court, who was held in a cell too small for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are in principle entitled to financial compensation if they are placed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, the parties can even hope for money if they were locked up in the too close rooms for a few days (Az.: 1 BvR 1127 / 14).
In this way, an ex-prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful: he was housed in the Berlin-Tegel Justice Centre between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of floor area; the toilet was not separated in space.
After that, the man who, according to his lawyer, is now on the free foot had been moved to a larger cell.
His action for liability for the unworthy conditions of arrest against the Land of Berlin failed.
But the constitutional judges lifted the judgment of the Chamber Court of Berlin and rejected the case for re-examination there.
You see the man's human dignity hurt.
The Court of First Instance now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days of the period in question were in charge of compensation, a compensation claim was made.
Otherwise, "a mockery of the legal protection of personality" would be to be feared.
The Chamber Court now has to clarify the amount of the damage to the money.
The constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
So they only agreed to a prisoner's compensation in April because he was locked up naked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is also unworthy of human dignity.
In addition, Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 a man-unworthy accommodation.
The former plaintiff was housed in a cell like the Karlsruhe case between 15 and 21 hours a day for three months.
The Berlin prisons have also come to the headlines in the last few weeks for lack of staff.
Prisoners are therefore always included for 23 hours, the aggressiveness is increasing, even in the fight, because of the tense situation.
According to the Justice Press Office, 21 posts in Tegel are not occupied because of the lack of young people, and 19 are expected to fall away in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We can do this"
The immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What is the point of Germany?
According to the Federal Ministry of the Interior, some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) Germany is even able to take up one million refugees.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do this and we can do it."
What is coming to Germany is the following overview.
According to different forecasts, between 350000 (estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimate of the Pestel Institute) apartments are needed each year - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as it has been built so far (250000 apartments).
The lack of housing is dramatic, however, especially in the case of affordable rental objects: every year 60000 to 80000 social housing will fall out of the rental price binding, and refugees will also apply for these particularly favourable apartments.
Federal Minister of Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
This is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social housing would have to be created annually and the federal government would have to invest a funding of 6.4 billion per year.
Some of the scientists and Federal Minister of Construction are concerned that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing.
The Institute for Labour Market and Vocational Research estimates that 55% of the refugees can be employed in Germany in the long term.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications in order to help them get in, Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation, criticises.
For the integration of refugees, however, it is crucial that they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, to the appreciation of the host society, but also to the self-esteem of the immigrants, says Migration researcher Dietrich Thänhardt.
In Germany, according to Thränhardt, there has been a political change: from the ban on refugees to the recognition of work.
While there was a prohibition of working for asylum seekers up to five years old, it was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the residence obligation, which restricted asylum seekers to one place of residence.
In society, the majority of the people in the labour market, also because of the shortage of skilled workers, have taken the view that refugees should be allowed access to the labour market more quickly.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is the lack of German knowledge.
There is not yet a sufficient range of general and professional language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most often provided by personal contacts.
The development of networks is therefore, in the view of Thränhardt, the Royal Way to work integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few fled parents give their children to the Kitas, estimated at 10 to 15%: "For the unrooted parents it is first of all very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
In order to convince the family of the benefits of the Kita, the administration distributes handbooks in different languages.
If the need for teachers was to rise strongly by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more specialised schools.
In the countries, students with no German knowledge are prepared for education in welcome classes.
But they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffer of the Berlin School Administration.
The German student work estimates that about 20% of the refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no Federal State will prohibit asylum seekers or the patient from studying - the only exception to date was Berlin, but interior senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his position.
Students could be given access to higher education.
For refugees with a residence permit or a right to receive no more benefits under the Asylum Applicant Services Act when they start a study.
In principle, the latter do not receive a Bafög, as they do not fall within the circle of the Bafög persons.
Permitted refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to Bafög, this range is reduced to 15 months from 1 January 2016.
However, this financial gap must also be closed, and Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the German Studentenwerk.
The students should get Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should successively grant Islam the same rights as the churches have, and further develop the existing state-church law to a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that takes professional care of the newcomers.
The rights also include obligations.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and give it certain control options.
This includes the willingness to act against religious fundamentalism.
The Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed the concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany.
Those who wanted to face such conflicts in Germany "have immediately exercised their right to stay here, in Germany," he said in the Bayrische Rundfunk.
He proposed that the Basic Law be translated into Arabic.
Integration will be a subject of the whole of society in the future much more than it is today.
This will also require a change in the majority society, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will be more urgent.
Germany has, as a result of European decisions, had an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law for a short decade.
But it is very slowly, as the NSU series showed, that the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
The same opportunities for all: what migrant organisations and the interests of non-white Germans have long been calling for, and what international agreements such as the Anti-Racial Convention require, must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and use its new citizens' opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care for the refugees that have been expected so far, says doctor President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As far as man-power and capacity is concerned, we can do this," he said to the day-to-day play.
However, additional money would have to be put into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery calls on all arrivals to hand out health cards as soon as they are registered.
Benefits provided could later be taken into account with the Federal States.
And in the long term it is highly questionable to eat so many people with the limited range of services provided by the Asylum Applicant Performance Act.
Otherwise, doctors make the most of the language barriers to create.
Already so far, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has proven that migrants are getting worse informed about their diseases than other patients.
It is not only in clinics, but also in medical practice, that interpretation costs should be taken over.
However, many refugees would also be helped with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnostic look.
There are, for example, much more untreated disabilities among refugee children, and the young people are concerned with HIV education.
But with the partly other disease images, German doctors would be clear from their training, says Montgomery.
"Parasite infestation or tuberculosis are not so difficult to see." And as far as the medical problem is concerned, the refugees may even be in sight for relief.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, and some refugees were even doctors.
In order to be able to practice, however, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly carry out further tests.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to the estimates of the Federal Psychotherapist Chamber (BPtK): most suffer from post-traumatic stress or depression.
It is particularly vulnerable to refugee children, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recent study by TU Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traumatized in Germany.
Those who are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder suffer from, among other things, so-called flashbacks with difficulty in breathing, dizziness, heart rate and death fears.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, strong horror and emotional numbness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment was necessary, Munz explained.
So far, however, only four percent of the mentally ill refugees have received psychotherapy.
While mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social offices, the processing usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social offices, most of the staff or doctors who are not trained for mental diseases would decide whether or not therapy is necessary.
This often leads to misassessments, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new production "Passion," the Circus Probst uses the traditions of circus art.
The aim is to draw every age group into the banishment of fascinating acrobatics, animal dressings and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites to the manege on the brick to wash to dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior chief.
"Passion" - under this motto is the current mane-production.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the family Probst.
So the gift of enthusiasm lies in the blood of the family.
"It is important for us to take people away from their daily lives and take them to a completely different world for two hours," the 27-year-old junior chief stresses.
"Manegencocktail with World City Flair," says Director Reinhard Probst.
50 cities on the 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair.
The programme of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family brings the audience to their senses with a joke and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of the silent films it wants to take the Cuban duo loose.
Easy and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art on the mast is to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
Apart from numerous salmon almonds, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinates with fingertips and joints.
Balance with the unicycle on a bullet?
No problem for him Yuan.
Snake people fascinate and frighten at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics as few others and fascinated by their mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," stresses Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
There are only too many problems in the attitude of circus animals at various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also takes a position on this: "If our animals are not well, we are not good either."
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit.
The "four-legged artists," as they are called lovingly, are read by the eyes as much as possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel well, it doesn't want to go to the manege.
So the top commandment: take good care of the animals.
The family of Probst is particularly proud of its zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland Ponystallion and a zebrate.
The two animals have lived together for eight years in a joint and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The zebroid is not yet ready for the manege, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
So there's something for every visitor.
"One is certain," says Stephanie Probst: "No matter whether five or 1,200 spectators, we always do our best and are with all our hearts."
From September 17 to 20, the Circus Probst invites you to his ideas at 5: 00 and 8: 00 a day.
The program will start on Sunday at 11: 00 and 4: 00.
Thursday is family day, for the show at 5: 00 the prices are reduced.
The animal show is also open daily from 10 am to 6 pm.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe is making a wrong speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year.
He remained unhurt, but the video of the case quickly spread over the social media.
The opening of Parliament was also shaken by allegations by opposition members that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned that Mr Mugabe's speech would be accompanied by buhrufen.
Last month they had booked him out and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The spokesman for the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that they were waiting to disturb Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Death'," he said journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members of Parliament concerned that immunity will end in Parliament, and once they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity will no longer be effective.
The chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and saving efforts in the company's services.
HP will later this year split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its faster-growing company hardware and its service business activities.
The expected job reduction leads to a burden of over $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, said HP in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will allow for a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a wide and deeper portfolio of business that support companies in the transition to a new style of business," said Whitman.
As an independent company, we are better placed than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion annual sales and "will be focused on providing previously unachieved, integrated technology solutions for companies," a company statement.
It divides a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical systems and whose Palo Alto Garage is called "the birthplace of the Silicon Valley."
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to manage the departure from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The measure of HP, the world's second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies, is the latest in this area, based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance.
FC Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says that team colleagues must stand behind the injured Jack Wilshere before the game against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger pointed out to Wilshere that it was only September and as long as his rehabilitation is planned, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and, given his history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is certainly uncertain.
The great shame with this current problem is that Wilshere had finished the last season after a separate ankle injury and had then returned to his old swing during the pre-season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten the career," said Wenger.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
This is not a bigger matter.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or to the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also recognised, there is the associated risk of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation of Premier Injuries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenals 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The wider picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08, which have seen the most injury days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you have to strengthen your body and win a struggle," said Wenger.
Jack's young enough to get through this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger is taking a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are expected to start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Girud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give the players who need a little break," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal are clear favorites to get on through group F, the Maksimir stadium in Zagreb is one of the most intimidating places in Europe.
Dynamo is also undefeated after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, with 3.2 measured on the judge scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from the last season with the Champions League surrender against Monaco and remains driven by the far hope of leading the club to its first European Cup triumph with its management.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
It's never worked on Arsenal before.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm in business long enough to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The lack of similar shows in shows is obvious, especially with regard to how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever before, as suicide rates among young men prove on a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably announced 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the fight to meet this challenge.
A recent study in more than 2,000 high-school students with depressive symptoms found that if the suffering had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood," his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course you have to have friends first so that a friendship can work.
In the age of communication through social media, with its focus on style over substance, the immediate nature of the answer is often more important than a significant contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, lifeline and successful, even if in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsical values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship, which has a much deeper impact on our mental health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can't buy luck.
The beauty of friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Each character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, which was shining through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments when watching football in cozy armchairs and the longing of Ross for Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it, even though they often stay away from exploring their feelings completely.
As an employee of the telephone services told me:... "my listening role for people who feel depressed and are at risk of suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old phrase "I can handle it" has an enormous effect, as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when you talk about problems openly. "
Friends is one of the shows that comes to my mind when I try to offer more long-term response mechanisms.
She clearly presents the small moments of men's friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may help people in the moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so when you visit Comedy Central Friends Fest this weekend with the completely redesigned backdrop for the celebration of the day, why don't you take your friends to a drink at the Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting around in Starbucks alone, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends will be sent to Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for # FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria is celebrating with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.
Di Maria makes his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG move to Malmö.
Here are the game report and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani took the course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö in the Prince Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who launched the French master, but after that they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when Cavani scored a head ball in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish Master, as they not only aim for the qualification for the KO rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game by Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahim's missed chances in front of the gate. He was later replaced in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he started his illustrious career already in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League. Therefore, it is a good start to win 2: 0 to cause problems and look back relaxed, even if there are certain things we still have to perfect over the season," said Blanc.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we did not achieve another goal or two. "
After his injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team in one of three changes, which was able to hold a 2-2 indefinitely in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend, but he was stung out in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentinean wing stormer was called the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he indicated why, when he was running into Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö defense before he closed off to Johan Wiland in the long corner of the network.
But if anyone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, he was disappointed.
Malmö, who hit Celtic in a play-off to reach this stage, joined Anpiff with nine national players in the field and was a serious opponent with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle field.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who went far past Kevin Trapps posts in the 34th minute, they offered little to attack.
Instead, PSG sometimes gave up on itself, with some misfits and bad accounts, not least from Ibrahim, who did not take less than five tests alone in the first half and then was abandoned after Cavani had used it after the reboot.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he put his fellow players in the game, and it was a pass by Ibrahim himovic, who turned Di Maria into a shot, which was passed by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the post...
The second gate finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguay player achieved its sixth saisontor after Ibrahim had fished a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all the thought that Malmö could come back to the game, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz, could keep the final result low before the replacement player Ezequiel Lavezzi was recognized a gate at the end.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
The qualification games are not enough. "
Take your hat off from Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion through stock sales
The Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, which is affected by falling commodity prices, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a stock sale as part of its huge debt-sharing plan.
The company Glencore registered in London said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off its own debts.
The company, which lost 57% of its market value this year, is fighting down commodity prices, as China's economic downturn is pushing demand and has a devastating impact on markets.
The issue of reference rights brought a rapid increase to the top of the London stock exchange in trade on Wednesday morning.
The share jumped by 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had announced last week's $2.5 billion stock sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to eliminate about a third of his $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new 125 pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the final course on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half, coal, copper and other raw materials prices have decreased by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday morning, 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar after a mostly long flight.
The refugees are from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xis's first official in Washington, will take place on September 25 and will return President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, said the statement.
The US President and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also be host of Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner this evening after the two leaders have had bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will provide the opportunity to extend American-Chinese cooperation on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to address areas of disagreement constructively," the statement adds.
XI, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to meet several US technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before moving to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concerns about alleged cyberespionage and its growing self-awareness in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.
440-PS sports cars borrowed and drove to scrap
A 29-year-old wanted to fulfill a dream and borrowed a Ford Mustang.
On the rain-wet highway then came the evil awakening.
At a company in the district of Gotha you can meet the dream and once borrow and drive a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.
This was also done by a 29-year-old from the district of Gotha.
At the A 71 near Arnstadt the dream was then out and over.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, got into the loop on the wet track and went to the board.
The sports car suffered total damage, no one was hurt.
The damage is estimated at EUR 40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sad Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
The FC Bayern was obviously just a few years ago before the commitment of Spain's Superstar Xavi, who played for Barcelona at the time.
Eight times Spanish champion, three times Cup winner, four times Champions League winner, two times Club World Champion, two times European Champion, one time World Champion - the title list of Xavi is breathtaking.
In the summer, the now 35-year-old left Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sad Sport Club to Qatar.
But in an interview with the Marca, Xavi now tells us that he was already standing before the EM 2008 before leaving Barcelona.
"I was told that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything at that time, we won nothing," he says.
And this was also registered by FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"Rummenigge wanted me."
In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't change
The change was not achieved.
And the decisive man for this works today for the German record master: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça signed Guardiola and I played a great EM."
"Pep told me I wouldn't change that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"He got me with that."
Who knows how Bayern's 2008 / 2009 season would have run with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against the Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn, turned off the Red (4: 0, 1: 1) and at the end celebrated the Royal Class triumph.
Matt Damon plays down diversity in film creation
Matt Damon confronted the African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a series of Sunday Night by HBOs Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown, when she stressed the need for alternative perspectives, in relation to a black protagonist in the selected script of the project, interrupted.
"When we talk about diversity, you do it in the occupation of the film and not in the occupation of the show," Damon assured.
Brown was shocked, with insulted disbelief and called "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when the comments of the actor of The Martian were confirmed.
Damon and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrell brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I would like to ask people to think about - whoever the director will be - how they treat the figure of harmony," said Brown first.
The only black person, and she's a hooker beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dar White People was in favour of the finalists Leo Angelo and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights of the film; Damon replied that their direction "could at the end give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded before disapproval of Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr. Pooni expressed his anger over the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's SO WEISS that it hurts."
The tweet made more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its publication.
Damon's comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of the social debate.
After the teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement achieved national effect and urged legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against coloured content.
In February, the singer Prince made an allusion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Album still matter," (albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black life, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have published a statement in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," said the Führer.
Recently it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
"American Ninja Warrior" crowns first champion
The first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took home the $1 million Grand Prix.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all the steps of his obstacle course.
During the season, two men, Caldiero and Cameraman Geoff Britten made it to the final.
The last task was to climb on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within time, with which he was the first athlete to complete the tiring phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero ended this challenge full of three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E! News after the hard-fought victory, still under the shock of winning the Great Price of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about I've never made more than $10,000 or had a life," said Isaac E! about his lot of money.
All of a sudden... as I can't even imagine... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why British, even though he was the first to finish the race, does not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time," said Weed.
How much money is a wonderful price and life changes, it gets the great congratulations.
I don't think he's having any grudge about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received many awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He's a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they'd changed the roles.
America Ninja Warrior was extended for an eight season, the filming will start in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tigers.
They used to be one of the best teams in baseball, and today the tigers are in the last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as a spoiler, but played this part perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the Target Field on Tuesday.
The Twins lost a chance to rise within a half-game of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard place.
For Detroit, if only for one night, it was a return of the three letter F-Word, which was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All the victories are fun no matter how it comes," said Tiger's manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to end this year," Simon said.
It's hard to throw every game in the bullpen, and that's why I want to go into the game very focused.
The designated Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was the first three-hit game of Martinez since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swam the wood well," said Ausmus.
He looked good in the (impact training), looked much better in the bullpen, and he put it right in the game.
With three runs at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a coin, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before being replaced by the left-hand Blaine Hardy.
Hardy overran the wall, the only man he was confronted with, in front of the designated rookie drummer Miguel Sano, who took a two-run from the right-handed Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the final run at the second, Verhagen brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the leading 27 times in the Major League this season that Plouffe hit a double play
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth innings, the wall created an RBI double against the close of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and reached the level of 5-4.
The right-hand man, however, stared Sano at three pitchers for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from a not yet moving Phil Hughes to start the game.
The Tigers achieved three runs in the first two innings against the right-hand veteran, which had been removed from the injury list before the game after he had been missing for more than a month because of a back suffering.
"Obviously not the beginning I wanted," said Hughes, "but I felt better when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitchers there in the third inning."
After they got the Leadoff batter in the first place, Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who created a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
The third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, made another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers added in the second, achieved a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single by Center-Field Anthony Goose to 3-0.
"That was a big blow," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he got the right job.
Hughes was in a pitch-count, and he did not score any points in the third inning before being replaced by the reliever right-hand A.J.Achter.
At Hughes there were three runs at six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez left because of an injury to the throw shoulder.
He was examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the injury list due to a shoulder fracture, is to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injury list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30
He's been missing since August 20th because of a fracture in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will finish their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees are to be found in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hessen.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people who arrived in it shall then be put in shelter in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden reported on Tuesday night.
She was expecting 450 to 750 refugees to come.
Several sports halls of the Hessian capital had been prepared for this case in the past few days.
Up to 1000 refugees can be temporarily accommodated there.
They are then to be distributed to other municipalities.
In the past ten days alone, according to the government's first-rate Giessen, 7500 people had arrived in Hessen.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency accommodation in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria to be a possibility.
"I believe that the decisive thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany," he said.
He proposed to the European States "collective vision of the way."
Four years ago, we were glad that the cup of a military participation in Germany passed.
"Now the conflict is falling on our doorstep," he said in the German radio.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international assistance on the ground for refugees.
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Minister of the Interior Johanna Mikl-Leitner said on Tuesday night in the Austrian television station ORF that no one will be sent back to Hungary.
Germany, too, did not send refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's agreed," she said.
On the question of an agreement that Germany could take up a certain number of refugees from Austria a day, Mikl-Leitner said that there had already been talks on this between the Director-General for Public Security and the representatives of Germany.
She did not mention concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
Over the past few days, tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria through the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU leaders, requested a special summit for next week.
Germany had started temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU countries have not yet been able to agree on a common approach in the crisis.
The EU's Home Affairs Ministers will take a new start at a special meeting next Tuesday (22 September) on the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees.
In view of the strong rise in the number of refugees in Germany, the Federal Government wants to support the countries more strongly in the initial reception and distribution of people.
The Federation would manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced on late Tuesday night after almost four hours of discussions with the Prime Ministers at the Berlin Chancellery.
Merkel stressed that those people who needed protection would also have them.
But if you do not have a lead-only perspective, you cannot stay in Germany either.
This view was strongly shared in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now had to cope with a "huge effort of strength."
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed its 175 km long border with Serbia on Tuesday night.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania would be closed with a fence.
This neighbouring country is different from Serbia in the EU.
Hungary wanted to prevent tugs from looking for information about Romania, said Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijarto on the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had measured the fence.
In Turkey, as eyewitness reports say, thousands of other migrants were on their way to the Greek border.
Space probe "Cassini" finds ocean on Saturn moon Enceladus
A global ocean swings under the ice-panzer of the Saturn Moon.
This is what researchers conclude from observations of the "Cassini" space probe.
The moon is thus slightly swamped around the ring planet on its track.
This taumelist movement is only small, but it is too large for a constantly fixed celestial body, it is said in a communication from the Cornell University in Ithaca (New York State) of Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the "Icarus" magazine.
It was known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice ceiling of Enceladus.
For example, "Cassini" had already discovered ice volcanoes on the south pole of the Saturn Moon in 2006, spying the water vapor and ice cream and thus feeding the so-called e-ring of Saturn.
At least on the South Pole there must be an underground sea, the astronomers closed at that time.
However, the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich has to give up about a month on offensive artist Valdet Rama.
An investigation has resulted in an adductor injury to the 27-year-old, the association informed.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Munich's lions, the diagnosis is "expected to mean four weeks of forced break."
"This is hard for us, Rama is a dubious loss."
"Of course we need to think now," said sports director Necat Aygün of the "picture" newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of an unparalleled professional.
As a training guest, however, the Sixties first presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract with the VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croat has at present "the opportunity to demonstrate his ability."
Torjäger Rubin Okotie can return to team training next week after his concussion.
On Thursday the Austrian national player is to start running training.
Ocotie had injured himself in the game at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0: 3) at a violent clash in the head.
In contrast to the first fears, he remained without a serious injury.
No diet fruit - mangos contain a lot of sugar
Mangos are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But he who wants to pay attention to his narrow line will often be turned away from them.
Because mangoes contain relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
The exotic fruits are still healthy: in them are B-vitamins as well as the vitamins E and C. Mangos, however, contain a lot of vitamin A and its pre-stage beta-carotene.
Those who eat the fruits thus support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying mangos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The shell color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangoes can also taste very delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet food.
A mango, however, also gives a special touch to savoury dishes.
It reduces the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as chicory and radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The US UPS package service restores up to 95000 support for the Christmas business in the US.
The company has already started the recruitment of seasonal workers, UPS informed on Tuesday.
The most important thing is to look for drivers.
Last year UPS had already increased its staff for the holiday season by 95000 grants.
In view of the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making arrangements for the Christmas business since the past year.
In 2013, late deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the package services.
First, hair storm, then striking cold front
The next night, in the valleys of the Alpine north side of the hair, the hair breaks, as Meteoschweiz reported on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and the night to Thursday, the hair dryer partly blows through the hair valleys with storm.
After the end of the fire on Thursday morning, a striking cold front crosses us that brings strong rainfall, wind bowls and a temperature drop.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front side of an extensive low pressure area across the British islands in a strong south-west flow.
On the north side of the Alps, the hairdryer breaks through the valleys on the night of Wednesday.
As a result, until Thursday morning, the hair dryer blows in the hair valleys with floors from 60 to 100 km / h, in a single and especially in the Urnerland also with more than 100 km / h
The hair dryer can enter the adjacent middle country, and even orchards of more than 120 km / h are possible on the mountains.
While in the north on Wednesday, stormy hair-dryer provides summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, the moisture on the Alpensüdhang is beginning to dust.
This is where rain stops until Thursday night.
In total, the south of the Alps will have to be expected in the next 48 hours with some more than 100 litres of rain per square metre, after large amounts of rain have already fallen in the last few days.
On Thursday morning the hair goes out of the air, and a cold front rolls from west to east with a strong, partly watered rain over Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind is very much to stormy, and the temperatures are falling significantly.
The following days present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees, while in the south it becomes sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees on the weekend.
Rome now has a Martin Luther place
Just 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome.
In the presence of the city president Ignazio Marino, a previously nameless place in the park on the Opio hill was christened on Wednesday to the name of the German reformer.
At the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now honored as "German Theologian of the Reformation."
The park is located in the middle of the old Rome just next to the Colosseum.
The name was requested by the working community of the Evangelical Churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, reminded on Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the Popes for centuries as a minority could often only live their faith in the Hidden.
With the place becomes symbolic that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) stayed in Rome for a few months as a young Augustine monk around the turn of the year 1510 / 11.
He then felt the city as a forsaken sinner.
According to historians, his negative impressions may have encouraged him in his later fight against Rome.
With his thesis against the trade in waste, Luther had then started the division of the Endland Church.
Hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (gold-plated) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar Alt has painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not in the Otmar-Alt Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent pictures.
At the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with colorful colors and imaginative forms has been preserved by the 75-year-old - but this is not equivalent to "funny" pictures.
On the contrary: adapted to the specific issues, this can seem rather gloomy.
Around three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective-artistic selection from the many themes of the "Book of All Books."
There are cycles that deal with issues such as the way of the Cross, the plagues, the commandments or our fathers.
With this he has spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther-Verlag with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler-Verlag with its focus on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who, based on the painting, has dealt with the respective Bible sites.
He has interpreted the Bible sites selected by Otmar Alt and so to today, in current contexts "translated."
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alt's painting.
They are embedded between the original bible quote of Martin Luther and a set of the artist, who here formulates his very personal thoughts on the situation.
The jewelry cover has golden letters.
So the 75-year-old allows twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high degree of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately the result of the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in 1940 in Wernigerode and grew up in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Order of Hernghuter.
"The upbringing has already happened with the cane," Othmar Alt remembers.
"I have tried to work this out in order to make up with the Lord Father."
His second concern was to make art more important in a fast-moving period of time: "The perception of image worlds is today marked by advertising, and that is loud.
Symbolic is being pushed out of there.
Artists have a different desire and joy to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "fall into the pictures," to make them work on them, to discover and to feel what power they have: "The image is looking for its opposite."
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt Bible in the Otmar-Alt Foundation, "always" to be a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures."
Alt did not pay attention to the full coverage of the Bible, but selected the important, also mysterious issues for him.
"This was not an eye-level cooperation," Altepost says: "This is about the pictures, the text only explains." A Bible of images was created.
For Hans Möhler from Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom."
Otmar Alt's pictures speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
A part of the original - paper and canvas pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on November 15 at the Otmar-Alt-Foundation.
Start of construction for BMX-Bahn near
Plans made, place found, company commissioned to model earth hills for a round course: A year later almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BMX-Bahn was already finished.
The failure in politics and administration was a cause of depravity, especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the train.
So, the hill was shut down, new place was looking for - now with formal planning and application for building permit.
The approval will be received in October, the first municipal office Sabine Mosebach-Bock was now able to report in the children's and youth's committee.
"I hope that this year is still visible," she said.
It was then to start working at the former indoor pool without "further recess."
DFB intensifies commitment to refugees
The DFB will extend its commitment to refugees until 2019, and the Bundesliga will provide a clear sign on the weekend.
Football is responding to the growing situation in Germany and ensures that the policy is helping to address the problems ahead.
"I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since the reunification."
"No one can say, in principle, that's none of my business, I have nothing to do with it."
"This must be of interest to everyone to tackle this issue," said DFB CEO Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany in an intensive way.
"I will be in the office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State, Mrs Özoğuz and the Chancellor there."
"The subject will certainly play a central role there," he announced.
The football could and wanted to help.
But the decisive course must be political.
The German Football Federation has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1: 0 for a welcome" by four years.
"Through the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019," said Niersbach on the edge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's / Malta.
Some of the federal ligists also support this programme.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional clubs set a clear sign when they will wear the imprint "We Help - # refugeeswelcome" on the left-hand jersey instead of the usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can," said Leverkusen's sports director Rudi Völler of the "picture" newspaper (Tuesday) and called the project "self-evident."
"The refugee drama concerns everyone, no one can look away."
"We football federal ligists can, no, we need to use our radiant power, our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly," said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league."
The national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Saale for the EM qualification game against Hungary on this Friday.
Niersbach referred to the support of refugees as "a great joint work of German football."
The fact that all 36 licensing clubs in their places had started their own projects is great.
Just as great is that small and small clubs are active there.
The message "1: 0 for a welcome" that we have spent is lived in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
In this and next year, the Association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, will provide EUR 300 000 for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already made the whole amount available for 2015," reported Niersbach.
Reports: SAP Chief of Management loses an eye in the event of an accident
The head of the board of the largest software group in Europe, Bill McDermott, has lost the left eye in several reports due to a fall in early July.
In the accident on the stairs in his brother's house in the United States he fell after midnight on a water glass he had carried in his left hand, reported the "economic week" on Wednesday.
"He was almost bled, fainted, then dragged out into the street - he told us so last week," says the "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Platner.
But McDermott could do his job.
"At the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," said Platner.
The 54-year-old manager was at the meeting and "fully working."
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday edition) that he would come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software business.
"I'm full of SAP, full of my job."
"Of course, I have been in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman, Hasso Platner," said McDermott of the "SZ."
McDermott usually commuts between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It was important to him to go to the public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said: "This can happen to anyone."
"It's important to get up when you fall."
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen out of combat...
Magnussen tweeted a corresponding photo and explained that he had suffered the injury when he fell off the wheel.
He is therefore not eligible as a reserve driver for the two tribal pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button during the night race in Singapore on the weekend as well as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan.
Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback by Marco Reus have finally broken in the first group game of the Europe League.
The national player will be missing the table leader of the Bundesliga also in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (7: 00 / Sky).
"We cannot rely on him, unfortunately," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen, the BVB coach left open: "We expect to return from him to the training on Friday."
Given the high load of his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his tribal melon the Reus position.
So he announced a change in the goalkeeper position.
This is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of Stepkeeper Roman Bürki.
"He trained at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
However, it was not clear whether the game was used in all Europe League games in the future, that Tuchel left it open.
He is likely to also contest the second game.
The research by fellow player Reus that the final entry for the BVB in the Europe League must be the goal, says middle-field player Julian Weigl: "Marco is not so wrong."
"I think we have a good chance to take the title."
Robotercars: Government wants a leading role for Germany
According to the Federal Government's will, Germany is supposed to be a technological leader in the change of the car.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrendt (CSU), which includes investment in the development of digital infrastructure.
On Wednesday in Frankfurt, on the edge of the IAA car, Dobrendt spoke of a "new mobility age."
Automated and networked driving will increase road safety and reduce congestion, said Dobrendt.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries, who also meet with industry representatives at the IAA.
The Ministry of Transport's strategy paper stresses, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio.
In order to test new technology, a test line is currently being developed on the 9 motorway in Bavaria.
In order to "avoid additional liability risks" for the driver, the Federal Government wants to "review the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt it to the new developments."
Germany, for example, wants to work internationally to increase the maximum permitted speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 hours.
The Federal Government is also committed to a change to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
In automated driving the car takes the lead, the driver becomes more and more the passenger.
The technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, the "far after 2020" of non-road vehicles on public roads is "to be expected."
The value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location of Germany is estimated by the authors of the study for 2025 to be around 8.4 billion euros.
"The digital network of the car can lead to more safety and efficiency in road transport," said Sören Bartol, SPD transport policy.
However, the question of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of the personal data of drivers must be clearly clarified.
Yet the German self-driving cars still see skeptical - much more than French or American.
A survey by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the Dekra audit organisation on Wednesday at the AA concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will take place in the next ten years, 32 percent only expect in 20 years, 31 percent don't believe in it at all.
In France, 21% of respondents expect autonomous cars by 2025, 33% in the US.
However, the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-driving vehicle.
After a survey of the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to pass control on all roads throughout the journey.
On the highway, this could at least imagine 15 percent in the flow of traffic, 45 percent in the congestion.
Well, every fourth would not leave the car to control under any circumstances.
Boll renders team and double start at table tennis EM
According to the current state of the art, Düsseldorf wants to only strike in the single at the title fights from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision is to be taken by 22 September at the latest.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The boys found out in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo," said Federal Trainer Jörg Roßkopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf.
At this time, Boll was on the flight to a long-term agreed sponsor company in China.
The 34-year-old German master is expected back on Friday.
"Without Timo, the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favorite," said individual European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who led the Setzlist in Yekaterinburg, also reminded of the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
"Timo was also missing at that time, and we have become European champions."
"We should focus on this," said the world rankings-fifth.
The English national football player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury to the right leg.
In the Champions League game at the PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit in a tackling by Héctor Moreno and replaced after long treatment.
The first diagnosis in the 20-year-old player of Bastian Schweinsteiger pointed to a shabby break.
Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax-figure chorus cabinet: the designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The highlights: display window dolls, which look terrifying human thanks to video projections.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, which, among other things, became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits - and by putting men in skirts.
"I can't say today that I'm the Enfant Terrible of the Haute Couture because I have white hair."
"It used to be bleached, it's real now," said Gaultier.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From the sidewalk to the walk), which is to be seen in the art hall of the Hypo-Cultural Foundation from 18 September, it is a good thing that the fashion creator has changed his initial negative attitude to a show about his person.
In fact, he was against it because, "For me, an exhibition sounded a little after death," he said.
If you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris stations.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the art hall, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the hardly visible work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an education.
The show is not built up chronologically, but it is an excellent choreographic work of art, for which a lot of effort has been done: For example, to freshen the dolls, a stylist was dedicated.
According to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, 14 tons of material have chartered the makers to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest, there was another special piece of work: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and in people who are a little different, said Gaultier.
Gaul's old Teddy is also to be seen in the exhibition.
He stands for the first, timid, fashionable walking attempts of the designer.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he dressed his Teddy BHs and clothes, said Gaultier.
With a doll, his parents wouldn't have allowed him to play.
He later taught himself how to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaul told in Munich.
But I bought them later, of course.
For his first fashion show he was unable to pay for the models.
They got nothing, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Plauener's lace as fashion niche
It used to be about the long embroidery machines in and around plums to make meters.
The embroidered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers who, for example, processed them into blankets and curtains.
This alone is no longer working today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the Plauen fashion tip.
Instead, the fashion is important again.
In the early times of the Plauener lace fashion played a greater role, then was pushed out by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as niche.
Reinhardt gives some examples: lace in jewelry, accessories such as bags and regional designs.
The so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past stilepochen, is an increasing potential for orders.
Those who do not use niche in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already make half of all the orders.
Modesspitze Plauen is a member of the industry association Plauener Spitze and embroidery together with nine other companies.
Only they may bear the protected label.
Over the last 15 years, about 80% of the turnover has been broken away.
There are almost no private shops and also wholesale shops.
Our products hardly reach the customer in this way.
The mass goods are now made much cheaper in the Asian area and almost exclusively distributed over chains.
In addition, exports are weakening, currently to Russia and the USA.
So enough reasons for new ways.
The industry association is also trying to score points through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer of the rock pearl in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce environmentally and socially acceptable."
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used."
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger outpost of the University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Art - and specializes in embroidery and lace.
To counter the competition from the Asian region, you have to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think primarily economically, "says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball tip.
The machine chokes small balls in some places.
The Plauener goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Kraußen was inspired by this: "Before I could not start anything with the traditional Plauener tip."
Now she's using the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, it marks the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify with the theme of Plauener's top - young and old," says Reuter.
It also supplies to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in plums and surroundings and who want a piece of memory.
With this I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauene tip.
Disney is planning new "Mary Poppins" film
Legends are not to be touched, but Disney still dares to have a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins."
However, according to "Entertainment Weekly," this is not about a new movie, but about a kind of sequel that plays with the magic nanny 20 years after the first movie.
It is about the experience of the Nanny with the Banks family in times of the world economic crisis in England.
Those who play Poppins for more than 50 years after Julie Andrews are still unclear.
But the director is already established: Rob Marshall, most recently with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges to open the economy more widely to the world
The economy needs to open up more widely to promote growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday, a group responsible for steering the reform.
"China should work to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business start-up strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Management Group to deepen a comprehensive reform.
To promote new start-ups and to promote reforms will create new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, said Xi.
The Management Group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list on market access, the relaxation of border control policies, the promotion of state-owned enterprises (SOE), private capital, and a review of the local reporting system.
According to the statement, a negative list is drawn up, identifying sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by testing programmes.
The initiative is important as it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensures a state-of-the-art business environment and makes the market more open, said the statement.
The government will also loosen controls on the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how they conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open up state-controlled sectors, further areas for private investment will be opened.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them," said the statement.
It will also make it easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimising requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to carry out their duties and to set up professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and major leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit in predators
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predators and thus to give consumers a significantly higher dose of the nerve poison.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a corresponding EU working paper, strongly criticised the plans: "The risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policy are passed on to pregnant and young children with full force," said Matthias Wolfschmidt von Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish for "economic reasons" are to be increased from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
However, large predators are already so heavily affected by mercury that, on the basis of the limits still in force, about 50% of the catches may not be sold.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 percent would be unsold.
In return for this relaxation, the EU wants to increase the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch, however, called this a "trick," because smaller fish, such as carp, are usually so low-loaded that they already meet the planned maximum levels today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfide distraction maneuver, which only helps the economy," said Wolschmidt.
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans, which is highly enriched by the food chain, especially in predators.
The Federal Government therefore warns against the fact that "already small amounts can cause, especially in the case of unborn damage to the nervous system."
The Federal Ministry of the Environment, on its homepage, explains, however, that it is not expected to be "a health hazard to the general population."
Mercury comes into the environment mainly through the burning of coal.
According to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment, the German coal power plants have more than six tonnes of mercury per year to Annalena Baerbock, who is a member of the Green-Bundestag, two thirds of the total quantity issued in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in Elbe, Rhein and Danube, was "permanently and comprehensively exceeded," had quoted the "mirror" from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings against mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU's RASFF warning system.
