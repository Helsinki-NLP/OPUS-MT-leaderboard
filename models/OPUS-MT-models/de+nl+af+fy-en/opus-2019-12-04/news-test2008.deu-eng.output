Food debt to European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation measured in the euro area was the rapid rise in food prices.
In the 13 countries of the euro area, inflation was higher than expected in November - after 2.6% in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1% was recorded, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts have been based on only 3 percent, reported Bloomberg.
In contrast to the US, British, and Canadian central bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the central rate, and the reduction in interest rates would, in their opinion, favour the rise in raw materials prices and the slight fall in unemployment.
The ECB is trying to keep the inflation rate below two percent, or at least close to the two percent mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in the twilight mill: it is necessary to "cancel" inflation in order to exclude the need for action later.
At 3.3 percent in November, the inflation rate in Germany reached a 12-year record level; in Spain, the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The increase in food and energy prices was responsible for the rise in inflation in the euro area.
The MATIF wheat quotations increased by 88 percent, and the soybean price also reached a record level since 1973.
There was also a significant increase in food oil and milk products in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil increased by 52 percent this year - last month the price per barrel of black gold reached almost 100 US dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1% to 2.5% in 2008, but it is expected to fall to 1.9% in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts expect a 3-percent inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1%.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to reduce interest rates twice.
Gallup places government crisis
After a long period of stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathizers has grown significantly until the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has the largest base camp, while the approval of the Socialists has reached an unprecedented 13 percent low point, according to Gallup.
In the case of the party-ridden voters, the difference is clear thanks to the high determination of the opposition supporters: more than two thirds (71 percent) are opposed to one fifth (20 percent) of the MCSP's consent.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are under the parliamentary barriers to entry: they reach two percent in the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low point, the general economic mood has continued to deteriorate - never before has the proportion of those who consider the economic situation of the country to be "very bad" been so high (41 percent), while a further 46 percent consider it "rather bad."
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expect a further deterioration in the situation; only one-tenth of the population is expected to be better.
A Gallup survey carried out in December showed that 71% of respondents - a historical high - considered the work of the Prime Minister to be "rather bad than right."
Thirteen percent of respondents have great confidence or trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the share of supporters for Viktor Orbán is 38 percent.
About 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared to 27% of the mistrust against the party's head of the Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the political mood is the number of people who think that the dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister could be tackled even without change of government.
If, after the unrest last October, 35% of the government and the head of government were still in office, this share is now only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent said they would "participate with certainty," and another 20% would "probably" vote.
By comparison, if the parliamentary elections were to take place this Sunday, only 55% would go "with certainty" to the urns, a further 15% would consider their participation "likely." In view of these trends, the result of the referendum would be foreseeable.
74% would vote against the tuition fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% against the hospital daily allowance.
Moved to the group of participants in the popular vote "with certainty" the shares of the opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would be 81, 84, and 89 percent respectively.
Auchan the most expensive, Tesco increased by almost a fifth
This year, the hypermarkets in the Budaörser trading area continued to maintain the average price increase of 16% of last year, with the exception that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Article from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budapest trade triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has also increased by 16 percent this year, but in all hypermarkets price increases of over 1,000 HUF have been recorded.
Since prices in the food markets were "galloped" last December, the rate of inflation has not been drastic, compared to the already high, previous level of output.
However, it certainly has a deterrent effect on consumers that what they have paid for in the last year is not even available for $10,000 this year.
The price of the "Napi" shopping basket exceeded the magical 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the markets under investigation.
The highest price was HUF 10,573.
(In 6800 the price was 6.800 HUF.)
The prices for Unicum and live fish remained almost at the previous year's level, while the prices for turkey breast fillets, nut and poppy have increased significantly.
Prices for flour and bread were in line with the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but at Auchan there were 1kg of bread for 139 forint.
There was no competitive price fall in the product to below 200 forint.
The price of a two-litre Coca-Cola Pfandbottle of less than 200 forint was also surprising, so the drink including Pfand cost only 257 HUF.
However, this year, in the "Napi" product basket comparison, Auchan was the most expensive, and Cora was the best.
Our calculations have shown that Cora's prices in the "Napi" shopping cart compared to the Christmas prices last year have increased by 15, while Tesco and Auchan have increased by 18 percent each.
The difference between the cheapest basket of the previous year and the most expensive basket of today was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest basket of last year and the most expensive basket of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was HUF 1,480.00.
The average price increase in the previous year was still 1,206,00 Forint, but the increase in VAT at the prices at last Christmas was noticeable.
This is exactly what has struck trade: it seems that the stores of goods were not able to decide what price margin they should apply to the individual articles, as the effects of the price increase on consumer behaviour were essential.
(If the trader does not plan the speed of circulation of a product, it may fall by significant profits in the price margin, which is based on the transport intensity.)
The increase in the "Napi" basket was so radical last year that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, while the price difference in the cheapest basket was only 844 Forint.
This year such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost around 1,630.00 forint more than in the previous year, and even the cheapest one was a price increase of 1,284.00 forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic increase in prices, the price of daily consumption items in the hypermarkets increased by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This in turn does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic food, the Statistical Office recorded a more than 30% increase over the 12-month period.
So in about next to flour also in eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems to be almost impossible in the latter, as the price level of the product that was already expensive in the previous year has increased by little more than 10 percent even in the worst case.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers - after all, they were able to turn the drastic price increase on the multis.
In the golden trade triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; it is constantly reported of good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three stores no longer look at the prices.
It is bought from all large quantities, and can be kept in pallets across the shop tables.
Wednesday morning in the morning there were endless snakes at the cash register in all three stores when the number of customers suddenly exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country, so many multis complain to opinion researchers that they could not even achieve the planned turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Many places are saved on disinfectants
More than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals due to an inappropriate treatment of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in hospitals, the overlay of beds, the overload of staff - all factors that are not exactly conducive to the containment of infections, says the leading doctor of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Many places are also saved in the case of disinfectants.
In the traumatology department of the János hospital, an MRSA infection has recently been diagnosed.
The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient who was admitted to the hospital after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection here.
The injured person of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but a little later the man had to return with an MRSA infection. An important operation could not yet be carried out because of the bacterium that is still in the patient's body.
By 10 December this year, infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were reported to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System from hospitals in 1094, according to the leading physician of the National Epidemiology Centre, Karolina Böröcz.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been registered in hospitals, but the dark rate is likely to be higher.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSA, which is resistant to methicillin-oxacillin, Staphylococcus aureus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about one third of the people in their nose without causing a disease.
SA-related infections (such as throat inflammation, almond inflammation, skin inflammation or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well-treatable.
However, if the means are used too high or incorrectly, the well-responding bacteria produce antibiotic-resistant, which are rapidly spread in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
These bacteria may cause severe infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis, especially in patients with a weakened or permanently poorly functioning immune system, but also in the elderly or low body weight patients.
According to the medical director of the János hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents are part of the day-to-day disease.
One should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, warned Tibor Nyulashi - MRSA alone does not exist where it is not sought.
Resistance to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the care staff carry rubber gloves and masks at the supply, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment" - said Tibor Nyulasi.
When they are admitted to the hospital, the patients are examined for MRSA, but an infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling too rare
The majority of the infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoided, but the current conditions and circumstances would be unfavourable for the control of the emergence or spread of the multi-resistant disease, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and old-age homes, the hospital should examine the patients who have been delivered and immediately isolate MRSA infected.
However, in the Hungarian hospitals, the microbiological sampling is not used as often.
Not least because there are no subsidies for this investigation on the part of the State Health Fund.
Most cases would therefore only come to light when the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, the medical director of the epidemiology centre.
There are strict recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine on the part of the European Union, but there are also guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and diseases in Hungary.
Antibiotics therapy should be targeted, that is, microbiological studies are necessary to ensure that resistance to the drug cannot be established, but this directive is not always respected by hospitals.
Among the outpatient, or patients in primary care, microbiological sampling is even more rare, says Karolina Böröcz.
is saved in the disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most often transferred from one patient to another by the care staff.
This is why hand washing or wearing gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant shortcomings in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but there is not always the possibility of isolating the infected patient in the home hospitals.
The rooms are often overcrowded, the beds are close to each other, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from an epidemiological point of view.
As Karolina Böröcz further points out, unfortunately, in the less well-placed hospitals it is even possible to save for disinfectants, there are few carers, many patients - all factors that directly favour the development of infections.
Such infections are shown to be much less common there, or can be stopped the further spread of the pathogen where these protective measures are observed, says Karolina Böröcz.
Government programme against MRSA
To control MRSA infections causes enormous costs to health insurance, so they are fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its containment in the government programme, has been recorded.
The first signs show that the programme is successful - as published data show, the trend of MRSA infections in England has fallen.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals to be one of its priorities.
The police chief of death was not drunk
The official opinion is now available in the case of a fatal accident caused by the police chief of the XXII district.
The now retired police chief of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday in a car accident, was neither alcoholized nor under the influence of drugs, said Attila Morvai, the press speaker of the Budapest Supreme State Attorney on Friday after the official opinion on the case was submitted.
The opinion confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before taking the tax.
The former police chief, with his own car in the XXII district, bowed into the Kossuth Lajos street and ran over a 55-year-old man who crossed the road in an unmarked place.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a mitigating fact - the handlebar has, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the zebra strip, posture.)
The pedestrian is on his way to the hospital after he has been admitted to the hospital.
According to police reports, the handlebar suffered a shock, then returned his functions and asked for retirement.
The Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office has launched its investigation into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief had been cooperating with the investigators from the beginning.
A further EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Minister of Finance János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three EUR 400 million credit agreements in Budapest on Friday, which are to be used in education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects implemented by the Cohesion Fund with grants. The EUR 100 million loan agreement was signed earlier, and the current agreement concerns the use of the EUR 200 million granted.
The sum of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement will also be used to finance the budget of education projects.
The EIB has granted a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary, and the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later on in the context of the extension of the credit contract.
In the field of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly be implemented in research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, the underground line 4 was also discussed.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of underground financing with the EU, the original contract and possible modifications will be rediscussed.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects worth EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan interest is committed to EURIBOR, the loan is made available by the EIB with an 8-year extension, without any commission.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - the whole of Europe is looking closely at the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who is buying the EU's still cheapest market, but it is becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re / Max Division.
Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most sought-after patch for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe, with favourable ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Between the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, with Albena, the "gold coast," the "solar coast," and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the riders, but the real estate around Kavarna and Balcik are also increasingly needed.
According to estimates by Re / Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior of the country also used to attract investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the very favourable area of Russe has more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers tempting offers - commercial and office areas offer highest yields.
Bulgaria is on the best track to become one of the most attractive European golf paradise, thus attracting tourists in the other two seasons, in addition to the summer and winter season.
This is why forward-looking investors are already buying in in large-scale, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who purchase real estate in Bulgaria are also seeking to change their lives.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested parties from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and in the ski areas.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Geordu Jankov, Regional Director of Re / Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle down will either buy revitalized properties by 50-100,000 euros, or come down houses by 5-15,000 euros, which they will then renovate themselves.
Good connection and accessibility as well as communication possibilities are well written, but the proximity to a large city, shops and doctors are also crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group makes up business people who invest with the aim of a medium to long-term increase in value.
However, real estate in the capital is becoming increasingly expensive, due to the growing demand.
In the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the last five years there has been an increase of 21% per year.
The increase in real estate prices is far greater than the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentage
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue by Ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries will discuss the Bali Roadmap, which sets out the post-2012 emission reduction measures, that is, after the end of the Kyoto Protocol.
A major debate is currently taking place between industrial and developing countries.
The US has already indicated that they do not want to negotiate concrete figures, but they would be ready to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40% by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major issue of the conference is whether the developed countries are prepared to support developing countries both financially and technologically, in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement on support for developing countries has also been reached.
The adaptation fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member Council, expected at the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as shown in the Piac és Profit.
Hungary's six percent
Minister for the Environment Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection measures and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (as measured by 1990 values), whether the "post-2012" agreement is successful or not. The Union would even be ready to work for a 30% reduction, if other major developed countries in the world, or developing countries, are also ready to meet their obligations in a strong and responsible manner.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the objective of the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2%, while the EU, with its 15 Member States at the time, had already committed itself to a minus of 8%.
The target for Hungary is a 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the years 1985-87 - a target that the country will fully meet, as shown in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The deployment is high on Bali - at least the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would not come into force until after 2012. In this case, the reduction project set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new international emission reduction system, the importance of which also has been highlighted by the IPCC, the international UN Scientific Climate Change Committee, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in its recent report.
This would delay the emission reduction, and the increase in the average temperature of the earth by more than 2 ° C would be inevitable, which, according to scientists, would have very serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army is on YouTube
British Army units have published recordings of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase popularity on the video portal.
First of all, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: Special Forces stationed in Afghanistan have been charging videos of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reports.
The miniaturcameras that are mounted on helmets are checked at the airbase in Kandahar and then sent to London where they are placed on the Internet.
Political message inevitable
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under "defence headquarters" in spring 2007 to publish videos of Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the international peace forces (MNFI) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Use in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defence says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual objectives of foreign operations.
This kind of propaganda was almost free of charge compared to traditional television advertising, according to defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain amount of political message in themselves, as they confirm the existence of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
Americans advertise with game
But the army must also fight against amateur recordings, which, in addition to the carefully worked, censorship images, also create on the network - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the losses are spoken at the most, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
By the way, many videos were already in use on the platform of the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, but this "genus" has only recently been discovered by the British.
The Americans, however, are advertising in a slightly different way, namely with the free-download shooting game "America's Army," in which the player can slip into the body of the soldier in the context of a more or less life-consuming simulation.
Christmas party with Tombola and Pogatsche in the ministries
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth is by no means cunning: instead of a Christmas party, she is organising a working conference in which her staff can make the year 2007 sound out with coffee and pogatsche.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others have a wonderful Christmas mood with Tombola or a toast to the officials' hearts.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and buffet - this is how the power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already taken over the offices.
The largest Christmas celebration of a ministry is held here in the defence department, but the staff of the ministry are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas party of orphans" children are given by fallen soldiers, at the "mission party" family members of currently stationed abroad are served, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resort provides about 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other departments, the National Agency for Development (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport are on the verge.
The 4.32 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is held in the House of the Future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
The main focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a Tombola retreat.
The National Agency for Development (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million-year-old Christmas celebration in the House of the National Justice Council (OIT) on Wednesday, with concerts and a ceremony.
The rental was 1 million forint, the rest was spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, one of the NFÜ's departments is also invited to another Christmas party organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
The building of the "Vígszínház" was rented for the celebration.
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information, as we have not reached the responsible.
What's the suit for?
The OIT building was not only open to the guests of the NFÜ, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia ball there instead of a Christmas party on December 7.
They didn't have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a minister's speech, after dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo] it was announced that there was no ball wear or suit obligation at the ball.
The ministries of health, work, and self-administration are preparing for puritanical celebration.
The Ministry of Health is organising the celebration for the employees in its own four walls for about 400,000 forint.
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth officially invites her staff not to a Christmas party, but to the conference for the annual publication.
It is expected to have about 180 guests, who, according to the press department, are only served with coffee and pogatsche, so the celebration is based on 350,000 forint.
The self-government minister, Gordon Bajnai, with his colleagues, will simply be in the aula of the Ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is organising a Christmas party in its own festival room, for which 436 employees are expected.
The expenses were measured with 2,500 forint per head - around this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent arrival.
Since the beginning of the term of office of János Veres, the PM staff have been celebrating this way every year.
However, there will be no real party mood - not only because of the official speech of the Minister, but also because the party was scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites on 20 January to a New Year's reception, the Christmas celebration of the Ministry is this time out.
One hundred guests are invited to the castle of Vajdahunyad in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the department, the expenses are estimated at 1,000 forint per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple reception, to which foreign diplomats accredited only in Hungary will be loaded.
The reception, which is held every year, has traditionally started with a short speech from the Minister and has a restrained sound.
As the relevant press offices report on [origo] request, there will be no Christmas party either at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or at the Ministry of Education.
Question about the costs of the Christmas party could not be given to the press department of the Ministry of the Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the party, which is held in the art industry museum.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation will form their Coordination Committee on Friday for the indefinite duration of the strike starting on Monday.
On Saturday a protest general meeting will be held, on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act - the establishment of the labour market will begin.
It is expected to have strike-related, significant traffic barriers, as rail transport is almost completely shut down, and the public transport business (BKV) is also on strike until 1 p.m.
Details of the strike on Monday will be announced jointly by the League of Trade Unions and the Trade Union Federation on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee is also set up to coordinate the actions on Monday.
A protest general meeting will be held on Saturday, and from Monday all organisations that have joined the strike will lay down the work for an indefinite period of time, provided that no agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike, which began on the day of Parliament's vote on the Health Insurance Act, was not defined.
If the National Council does not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the law is adopted, the strike committees shall meet to discuss further action.
On the basis of the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even conceivable that there will be a vote on the Health Insurance Act only in the later hours of the evening, or even at midnight.
The strikes that start on Monday will have to be expected to lead to significant traffic barriers: the railway workers will lay down their work for an indefinite period of time, the majority of public transport and more than half of the Volán companies will remain silent in the morning.
At the same time, there will be many local motorway blocks of a direction.
The call for strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organisations - the list of participants is constantly updated on the Liga website.
Some organisations announced strikes for an indefinite period of time, others are planning temporary employment.
Until Thursday afternoon, no agreement could be reached between the Hungarian railway MÁV and the Free Trade Union of the VDSZSZ railway company, although more and more people are on the track just around the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, the LIGA trade unions for electricity and heat energy are running at the BKV from start-up to 1: 00 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 and 9: 00 a.m., the LIGA trade unions are laying down the work for four hours, and the teachers' union, for example, have called for 2 and 2-8 hours of strike.
The Hungarian Medical Association is in a state-of-the-art conflict at various times, the EDDSZ, the democratic union of the health and social workers, a suborganisation of the SZEF, the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the League is that the government takes back the draft health insurance reform and presents a new concept for social discourse.
The second is the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
The third requirement is that the qualifying professional groups should be able to access the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ, which is part of the League of Trade Unions, did not accept the offer made by the Ministry of Transport and now calls for a new approach.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increases State Risk
According to the Political Capital Risk Analysis Division, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded in August, with the support of the "Movement for a Better Hungary," have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
The Institute's "Risk Warning Report" states, among other things, that, in the context of the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "intensification of the existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy populations in Hungary, which could lead to violent ethnic conflicts even in the short term."
The main reason for this was the Hungarian Guard's strategy, which is probably aimed at provocation of such a conflict, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure by the political leaders: "People of public life have left the discussion of the Roma question to representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary contrast."
It is believed that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, promote extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent conflicts.
The research institute also considers that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention of the national and foreign media, "significantly damaged the image of Hungary abroad, in particular as regards confidence in stability and democratic maturity."
We remember: since autumn 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extremely right-wing groups in Hungary has been on the rise, so that since summer 2007 several organisations known as the "national self-defence association" have been established.
"These groups are common that they define themselves as a civil organisation, while they are openly boasting to prepare their members for - sometimes armed - defence tasks (civil protection, state defence, order prevention), calling for the insuitability of the police, the army, or the state itself," they said.
And further: all this is done according to that method, which tries to cover various political aspirations, based on the political and party detentions of the population, as a bourgeois initiative.
So the emphasis on civil character and the form of association is not just about circumventing legal barriers that could appear in the course of the registration to the court - it is a political strategy at the same time.
The analysis shows that the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-enhancing factor in relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, so some of the ultranationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see the emergence of the Hungarian Guard as the confirmation of its own anti-Hungary policy.
All this has an impact on the political stability of the region "- it was said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central-Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the whole region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, the establishment of which was announced by the right-wing extreme Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
In the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard, there were the Roma mass eruptions that took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has taken the incidents as an occasion to set up the National Guard, arguing that the aim of the organisation is "national protection."
In her view, in the last 17 years, a correct "gypsy terror" has been felt in Bulgaria, but the state has remained indecent and indifferent - according to Political Capital.
And further, the initiative would have been a serious debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I have said, the increased risk of ethnic conflict is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced that they will set up their own guard for resistance.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that the Hungarian Roma also respond to the threats by organising their own protection, it is stated in the Political Capital Risk Alert Report.
Attila Juhász, research director at Political Capital, said at the request of the news office: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Annual risk analysis reports would be published and, if risk-changing trends are identified, public opinion will be informed, as in the case of the issue of the risk-warning report.
Festive days are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary, holidays are regulated by law, so that the practice of redisposing of working days around the holidays has now been established, but the coming year will give us less days.
In the EU and in America, something else is understood as "holiday."
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between state holidays and work-free days.
Non-working days are mostly church holidays, or are related to important historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year's: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are work-free days - the latter alone so that the New Year's celebrations can rest.
We have a total of 14 holidays throughout the year.
The public holidays are the 15th of March, which reminds of the revolution of 1848, and the 23rd of October, the anniversary of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20, the foundation of the state, on May 1, the work is celebrated, on November 1 and 2, we will commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each at Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our public, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "working day shift" has proved itself in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on the Saturday before, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the public holidays, is finally to be completed, the Minister of Labour has for a long time been laying down its own regulation.
The legislation applies to all employers and employees, to public employees and public service officials alike.
Only companies and facilities in which the operation is continued without interruption, including on public holidays, are excluded.
Heuer is only a little confused by the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24, the life of this country will remain formal, as most of the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve will take a time-balance, or take the special holiday for it.
In the next year, more holidays fall into the middle of the week, or the end of the week, so that there will be less shifts in working days than this year.
The calendar is first "put on the head" around the day of work so that people can stay at home for four days at a time.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day so that Friday, May 2 can be a rest day.
The second shift is related to the holiday on 23 October: on Saturday, 18 October you will have to work on Friday, 24 October in advance.
The end of the year, however, will be in the sign of the public holidays, after everything will lie and remain on the 24 December, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six frightening little things to annoy colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, language messages that we never get - harmless lies that we no longer notice: they bring "color" into the everyday life of the workplace.
The question is whether to get used to these little inconveniences, or rather to the challenge, and try to deliberately avoid these misunderstandings, for other annoying situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone from the marketing department called" - says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make it up to it by calling the marketing department and saying that you forgot to send the message (that is the less usual method).
Most of the time, the thing is done with an apology.
Before you get into embarrassing excuses, you should think about what really makes your colleagues uncomfortable moments and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Losing something that doesn't belong to one of your own?
There's hardly anything more annoying than taking a document, office accessories, or the phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday the handler was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost pen found on a colleague's desk?
There is no need to borrow from colleagues without questions, because they are rightly annoyed when they find that something has come away.
So, don't put any caverts or post-it out of the office in your pocket, because it could hit you yourself: no more if you need it.
You're talking about the personal life of your colleagues?
There is no effective way to stop a tragedy that has already been put into the world.
Who did what to who?
Where and why?
If possible, the information (or assumptions) about the private life of colleagues should not be tied to everyone!
And if someone opens up and tells us his inner secret, we should not abuse this trust!
It is best to remain silent as a grave, rather than to address those who are not present, even if others also know about the problems of the colleague.
Did you report sick for no reason?
When you call in the office to report yourself sick on the basis of a painful headache, because you are feeling unwell right now, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: your own work, inexcusable accomplishments, projects with fixed dates now have to be done by your colleagues instead of yourself.
So don't be too bad with the colleagues!
If you know the day before, that you won't be able to make it to the office the next day, or that something could come up, which is why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Gummed, Gagging, Telephone
You are in the middle of your work, but are you suddenly disturbed by the voice of your colleagues?
Unintentionally heard a phone call you shouldn't have heard?
One should not annoy the colleagues with sums, singing, loud conversations (which one leads beyond their heads), trample, constant chimping or nostrils.
All this can be very disturbing, even if they are not very much in one task (writing, planning, organizing) deepened.
Is it always the others?
If a project is not finished in time, one has forgotten to send an important letter or important news, one should not seek the guilt of one's own forgetfulness!
If possible, you should not talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
The best way to admit to his mistakes is to apologize if others were affected!
The question of how to make up for the mistake, or to make up for the failure, is only too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like home?
Training pants and sleeping: comfortable for home, but has lost nothing in the office!
Not even then should one dress so army if the workplace would actually allow it!
Just don't get too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself to the extent that you dress up in the office - if you want to, you should also be beautiful and elegant!
To make it right for all - or how to get uninteresting for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning traffic.
A strange melody sounds from the radio: the sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I'm gonna turn the volume up.
The pace changes, the bass comes to the previous sounds, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which sounds on mr2.
The home music scene has not exactly spoiled us for a long time with a high-quality electro.
But now you even see the congestion differently when you hear the new album of Zagar.
The appearance of Yunderboi, so some new and exciting production from the local digital underground scene is slowly contributing to a change in the overall picture, and even if the garage rock with its guitar quiz is "in" again, the domestic electro-top proves: there are new ones under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs, even in the band Yonderboi, before he - perhaps because an inn does not tolerate two pillars - began to take his own way.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, the elements of jazz, electronic, and pop melts, but he only managed with the request to compose the soundtrack to a film to him (e.g.
= = References = = = = External links = =
The formation, which initially appeared in smaller clubs, became known to the wider audience only when the magazine "wan2" redirected its first album from 2002 among the top 50 national albums and Zagar, together with Yunderboi, was the almost only trend setter that could be marketed in the West.
Zagar and his band were "trendy," but none of them cared if they liked to wear this brand.
The band has responded as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album now released with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open up new ways to them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression comes from the time when Balázs Zságer was still on the road with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would be fine, but besides the essential character of the music, the louder guitar - in line with the spirit of time and the trends -, the influences of the rock 'n' roll, are striking.
With these songs the singer György Ligeti, living in England and working with the band "The Puzzle," presented himself at the premiere in the Millenáris.
A song from the album even made it to the radio beat - which has been sending pop music from early to late, mr2 Petőfi has successively set the earworm to the listeners with the number "Wings of Love," which was recorded with the participation of six local singers ("Underground Divas").
So you're all right (?).
The hvg.hu has requested from Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "shift music" does not mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be good and unsaying, but it can also be produced only for the sale that makes it commercial music.
A good pop number can also be created from an honest motive.
The willingness to receive the listener also works in accordance with this principle, independently of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience to your music?
B. Zs.: The pop music has a greater tradition abroad, especially west of us.
There are not only teenagers or twens on concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that are happening around them much more closely, because they also think they are part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience have in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many hear your music?
B. Zs.: Of course it is a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts.
But we have never composed for the market.
With us, the music is not created to serve a purpose, but for a particular reason.
The role of the audience is usually felt in the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but in turn there is only in the unreachable changes of the moment.
But I noticed one thing: if you want to make it right for everyone, you're no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yunderboi?
He is on his way as a soloist and has built his career more in the West.
B. Zs.: We don't really go his way, apart from trying to interpret this in our music over and over again.
We see ourselves more as a team player who trust in the other's musical presence and let them unfold.
At first, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yunderboi were inevitable, as several of us came from his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petőfi, "Wings of Love" is the first place.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening deliberately staged with a slightly more popular style towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We did not have any plans to write a hit that should then be used as a train horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was thought to be the final of the album with which we wanted to solve the sound orgy and the somewhat more difficult issues.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why just her, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea to put together the choir from gifted soloists of the home music scene.
So the six-member choir was created - that is, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then baptized "Underground Divas."
hvg.hu: Did you want the song to be the same, or did the girls play it?
B. Zs.: The number has been in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this number still needs "something."
The chord sequence has formally called for a voice.
I sang the melody the same night, later they learned the girls.
It all came practically at once and very spontaneously.
I remember, I was quite electrified at the time, but it was already the "Divas."
With my voice alone, the song would never have been so strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, however, you had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (apart from Judy Jay's short solo), they have no role, they sing together completely and are not louder than the music, so their song is not only accompanied by the music.
They were also standing on the stage.
Is it on purpose?
B.Z.: The fact that they were standing behind was the case because of purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want to give them solo roles.
The number is also about having to forget about your ego a little, forget who came from where and where we went, let's just let these particular wings, the wings of love, lift us up.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was created.
hvg.hu: Which was the most elaborate song?
B. Zs.: In the musical work of creation, there was actually none, there have been more difficult tasks in mixing.
For example, at "Dorian Gray's Dilemma," in which I play on a concert piano, or at "Rock'n 'Roll Goes To The Girls," where the groove no longer wanted to work, but gradually everything has joined together, like with a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which is your favorite number from the new album?
B. Zs.: This changes with the concerts all the time and now that I have released the album.
It is currently called "Prophet Is A Fool," "Escape From The Earth," and the number "Never The ame."
Defraud broker risked billions because of inferiority
Soil-free fraud
For example, his former employee Jerome Kerval is the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komerční banka.
It came at almost EUR 5 billion because of it.
It seems, however, that Kerva was just a big player who wanted to do it like his colleagues, but was certainly not incapable.
In contrast to all the large bank houses, he recognised the crisis in the American mortgage market in time.
"He is more psychologically weak," was heard from the mouth of his superiors who showed him to the police.
However, as is clear from the statements made by the French media, for example the daily Le Monde, he was a person who, at the end of last year, had achieved a profit of 1.6 billion euros in his business.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in his statement.
In the summer he was able to make half a billion euros, especially in the American crisis.
He had already taken the opportunity to do so at the beginning of the year.
In February, there was first news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as low-income customers or those who had previously had pay problems, would be in trouble.
However, this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kermuch didn't believe this and was right.
At the end of the year, he had made his profit up to EUR 1.6 billion.
"Even when I had made the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain it," Kermuch admits and says that he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
During the whole interrogation, he admits that he forged documents so that they wouldn't get him on the verge.
He even managed to lead his heads behind the light, even though the Eureka stock exchange was gradually interested in his business.
Risk profile
Was he afraid to fly up?
I don't think so.
"I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank."
How did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to step up his position.
He entered the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51000.
After two years he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90000.
But he knew he'd never make as much as anyone else.
"At my first conversation in 2005, I knew that I was being watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development, "Kerva explained to the investigators.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
With the shares of the Alliance, he made a lot of money by putting half a billion euros on the price losses of this title in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you make a profit, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the heads said they knew about everything, or they knew it.
"As long as I made money, you closed your eyes."
But then the big blow came at the beginning of this year.
On a single day, he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend in the middle of January, he wanted to make up for it.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it lost five billion euros because of it.
And how did they get to him?
He was a suspect on a vacation.
"I only took four days of the previous year.
A broker who does not take a vacation is one who does not want to see him in the cards, "said Kerva in conclusion.
Czech Republic has the chance to come to 365 billion
Czech Ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, which will allow the Czech Republic to reach 14 billion euros (around 365 billion crowns) in the coming years.
This is about half the sum that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to get around 100 billion crowns from the "Company and Innovation" programme.
The most money, about 150 billion, will flow into the development of transport.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22% of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money will increase in line with the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have a budget of 90.8 billion next year.
The "Enterprise and Innovation" programme is intended to help entrepreneurs and companies to gain funds to innovative businesses.
This will help companies to gain finance for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful to date in the current money acquisition from EU funds.
Nicaragua court confirms 20 years' imprisonment for ex-presidents
A court of appeal in Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday the 20-year sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, to which he had been sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud of $100 million (almost 1.8 billion crowns).
But later he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his Hazienda at the Nicaraguan metropolis.
According to the news agency AP, whether the former head of state (1997-2002) of this Central American state is back behind bars is currently unclear.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the arrest officers whether to leave Alemán's sentence at home or whether he has to go to prison.
A court held four years ago that Alemán had regularly moved government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictional and the accounts really belonged to his relatives and closest supporters.
Some of this money ended up in a fund that Alemán had set up to finance his election campaign in 2001.
Budget is by
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget that this government has designed and adopted without the support of the opposition by the majority of the coalition.
The current year was still approved with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because Minister Sobotka (by this party) had submitted it, and the ČSSD could not allow it to be rejected.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives approved this traditionally little observed, yet very important, law in peace.
That's kind of paradoxical.
All governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of the policy, but is covered by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more grateful issue for the media, and that is why they pay more attention to it.
A dispute between politicians is much more interesting for the public than sober figures.
The government budgets suffered from three weaknesses in the past Social Democratic governments, which the 2008 budget cannot at once eliminate:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure that is compulsory by law, which is not only pensions, but also social expenditure, which has decided on the "tacit" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (Communists) last year before the elections.
The second is the deficit budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third restriction is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the budget deficit of the municipalities.
However, the greatest risk is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is under public control and, to a certain extent, is under control.
But a real time bomb is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to revenue from taxes, taxes and bank loans, often issued unthought-of debt securities to overwrite their city houses.
In recent years, they have been able to pay off these debts by mass sale of shares of energy and other supply networks that they had received from the State on the train of privatisation.
Now this source is already sealed.
As far as we only follow official and verifiable facts, we note that:
For a few years now, like the rest of the world, our economy has been going through a growth phase, the ČSSD has been boasting itself without delay.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, these governments owed the state even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more rationally than our Republic.
This is a huge shame, which is mainly due to the former governments.
We are one of the countries that, on a global scale, are least at risk of poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes, which, unfortunately, have been overblown to a huge extent in recent years.
Although it has been possible to delete part of the dissenting populist expenditure that was adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if there is not a shift in the retirement age and a pension reform in the near future, virtually all policies in this country will end, and no matter who is in power, it will remain nothing but pure management.
It is only slightly exaggerated to say that then, from ruling politicians, officials who mechanically divide most of the tax revenue into pensions and social expenditure will become officials.
That is why this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the displacement of normal expenditure through compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion crowns for 2008 would be quite unnecessary if former governments had not spent in the last ten years, which was only possible.
If we do not want it to really be a matter of becoming pure administrative officials from ruling politicians, then we need to be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend as much as it is able to take on taxes and fees in order to seek peace in the preparation of further reform laws.
This is the only way for a balanced government budget to be implemented gradually.

Banks want to cope with crisis
The American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the crisis in the financial markets together.
For example, by means of auctions, more than $100 billion will come to the currency markets.
On these auctions, banks auction interest rates at which they are willing to lend each other money.
For example, the US Fed sends $40 billion to auction, and another 24 makes it easy for the European and Swiss central banks.
It is the first time, after the attacks of 11 September, that the central banks of each country agree on such a coordinated approach to the defence or mitigating of the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is intended to eliminate the major difficulties of the economy, i.e. the increasing lack of freely available capital that banks can provide," wrote in a report for his customers Bernard Baumohl from the Economic Outlook Group's consulting company.
"The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the US from 65% to about 50%," added Baumohl in his report.
The banks have already lost $60 billion for non-good loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions of losses.
"The central banks must have been really afraid of what can still be done, but decided to do so," said the head economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he said.
Central banks are afraid that if banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, they will also be more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and bring the American economy to a recession, possibly with an impact on economic growth around the world.
The central banks have decided to do so after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the London Interbank rate used in the lending of funds between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid of borrowing each other's money, even though the central banks of the US, Canada and Great Britain had reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as a further reduction in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of the Agency Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this step by central banks contributes to the warming up of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Ecologists' debates are incredible
Global climate change is said to be the most damaging to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again expressed his views on the issue of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the forthcoming UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue, No Green Planet," he said that the debates of the ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which is a strange mix of government representatives and those of non-governmental organisations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that it is accompanying and the reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word fireworks, which is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems," said Klaus.
In the presentation of his book, the Czech President stressed that his subject was very important to him, and that he was so committed to this.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared in German translation because "I often meet on caricatures of my views."
So now interested parties could read their attitude in full.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climatologist, but he considered that he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
Finally, he is an academic, capable of understanding and assessing technical processes, has experience in statistics and is also an economist.
As the main statement of the book, he described the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not too big and serious and therefore not a threat, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate are superfluous, ineffective and unacceptable.
In addition, he considers it unacceptable to impose other unproven views as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems, he sees this as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
On questions from those present, he repeated that he was not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who do not take into account the relationship between effort and yield."
Klaus had already spoken about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600000 people failed to change their driver's license
600000 drivers missed the time limit to change their old driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when you can apply for the exchange to enable the authorities to issue a new driving licence by the end of the year.
But the Ministry does not fear that after New Year's, hundreds of thousands of drivers will go to the streets without valid driving rights.
According to the authorities, mainly those who no longer want to drive have not changed their driving licence.
While small places report a strong decline in interest in the exchange of the lead, the offices of the capital are overshadowed with requests, and the interest in the exchange grew this week.
The city administration accounts for around 2000 customers every day.
You have to stand for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140000 drivers have not yet changed their driving licence.
The exhibition of a new driving licence takes 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a reduced period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver must pay 500 kroner.
Car drivers who do not make the required exchange by the end of the year and leave without a valid driver's license are at risk of a fine from January.
The culprit pays a maximum of 2000 kroner.
The police can, however, also give it a reminder in the event of the transgression.
In the event of an infringement, the penalty may rise to 2500 kroner.
According to previous information, the community may also be subject to a penalty that does not drive at all.
It was said that he could threaten a punishment of even 30,000 kroner.
The Ministry has already called on the offices to have a mild government and to impose a maximum penalty of 1000 kroner.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one is threatening a thousand-dollar sentence.
The driver's licence is a document in which everyone can decide whether or not to own it.
It is not a identity card that everyone, and that is a valid one, must have.
People who don't want to drive should give their license.
It is enough to take him to the competent municipal office or to send him there by registered letter.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will be invalid.
However, the drivers must also gradually change other types of driving licences.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 have three years to change.
The validity of driving licences issued in 2001 to 2004 will end in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more driving licences.
Court lowers penalties for detectives who were linked to Berdych
The former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of having done the same thing with the band of David Berdych, were arrested for 13 and 10 years respectively.
This was decided by the Supreme Court of Prague in a judgment of law, which reduced its sentence by one or two years.
Originally, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight against Organised Crime" threatened 14 and 12 years respectively.
There is no possibility of appeal against today's judgment, only revision at the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also charged with this matter, but he is before the first instance of the judgment.
In other processes, however, he had already received penalties of a total of 16 years.
He can't be sentenced to anything more.
In January, a district court accused 19 people in particular of taking part in robbery, and the Oberlandesgericht today negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the accused have been arguing the charge from the beginning on the grounds that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, police members in agreement with, among other things, Berdych criminals provided information from police sources, covered various robbery and helped members of the gang to evade the prosecution.
The band left Opava and Koňařík 30 percent of the prey.
The prosecution is about the crimes of the gang from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, about robbery, the victims of which have often suffered serious injuries, but also about the presumption of office and unauthorized possession of weapons.
In the case of house searches, the police discovered illegal guns, ammunition with steel core, a laser target remote tube and a machine gun.
The gang, according to the charges, has been enriched by many million crowns by their robbery.
In addition to nearly 20 men in this trial, Berdych courts and a number of others were legally recognised as guilty for further robbery.
Other men from Berdych's area have to be responsible for another trial, and other cases have not yet been brought to court.
The main negotiations have so far been missed by Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in prison in Ireland and are waiting for the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children switched - bill: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a maternity clinic, the lawyer of the damaged parents, Igor Veleba, from the hospital in Třebíč, wants to demand 12 million kroner compensation plus court costs.
For each of the mothers each three million, for the fathers each two million and for the children each one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent couple.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, therefore does not agree with the Velebas proposal at all.
"We reject such a proposal, it is too much," said Dostál after today's trial.
"However, in order to be able to give us an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the opinion that the other side had drawn up.
We'll see if it's even worth it.
But we insist that this should be in the hundreds of thousands for all together, "said Dostál.
According to him, the amount should be between 100000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the family from Jabloňov wanted a million crowns for every month that she had not raised her biological daughter.
For Veleba, the basis for the compensation negotiations was an opinion that the University Hospital in Prague Motol had prepared for him.
The parents of the children are considered to have suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms in different strength and depth from those in the area of psychology and psychiatry.
The men made the stress situation better, even if they saw themselves in the face of allegations that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborn.
The women, in turn, are in a worse position to cope with the effects of the experienced trauma, as well as with what is now going on, Veleba summarised the content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses from the maternity hospital in Třebíč on 9 December last year.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
The district captain of the Vysočina (Bohemian-Moravian height) handed over 100000 kroner to each family at the end of October as a substitute for the expenses they had incurred by the fault of the hospital in Třebíč, which is under the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law for liability.
In the event of doubt, they must reach a reserve fund, but only exceptionally can they request assistance from the institution.
The courts have so far allocated relatively low compensation amounts to those concerned, the amounts have been determined by tables and have moved in the area of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka came around his kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the argument about the "Kingdom of Walachei."
According to the judge at the District Court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the term "Walachian King," but the project had built a team around Tomáš Harabiš in cooperation with the actor in many years of work.
Polívka did not take part in the trial today.
According to his lawyer, this is probably not over, and his client will probably make an appeal.
"The argument is about Mr. Harabiš and his team wanting to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polívkas parasitic," said after the trial of Polívka's lawyer.
All of them introduced themselves to this actor and comedian in the words "Walachisches Kingdom."
The same opinion is also Harabiš.
"We have an almost ten-year work behind us.
Money creation and concepts of activities, "he said.
According to him, the occasion is a fight for money.
"After years, they noticed that the project is successful and that they could also have some of it.
They want to win parasitarianism in our work, "he said.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the name "Walachischer König" for the first time in one of his television broadcasts.
In 1993, the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him.
But that was not in line with the intention of creating a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came to the thought of spending Walachic passports.
From an original fun action a business and an entrepreneurial activity was crystallized, to which Harabiš then joined the foundation of the company "Walachisches Kingdom."
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and signature in the passports and even offered discounts to their owners when visiting his farm and his theatre performances.
Who's gonna sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabiš only used the only idea that Polívka had made public on the "Manege" mission for his business intentions.
"The popularity of Polívkas has certainly helped the project of the Walachian kingdom," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, who had been very devoted to him.
The cooperation of the parties that have been disbanded today lasted until the year 2000, when Harabiš organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
But since then, between Polívka and Harabiš, the disputes that culminated in the deportation of "King Boleslav I elected until the day of St. Nicholas."
The leading role was then taken by Harabišs Jarmila Šuláková as a royal mother at the suggestion of Harabišs Jarmila Šuláková.
In 2002, Polívka filed an action against Harabiš and his company, which the court rejected today.
The Harabiš-prepared competition around the throne and half a princess could bring clarity in the fight.
A new king should come out of this.
He didn't want to tell the details and an appointment yet.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It was supposed to be something like the king's move in the Walachery.
The king should be elected for a certain time.
Mr Polívka is also able to register quietly, "added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Swing forward parts
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of Peugeot 206.
His driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gear line, the steering and also the processing could be described as rather below average.
But now his successor, Peugeot 207, is on the market, and it is much better.
The combi called SW is a bit further, and I just have to rethink my opinion.
When I had tested the classic Hatchback of 207, for example, I had to complain about the too little head-free on the rear seats.
These complaints are no longer present, because the body of the combi is designed so that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Go on
I'm just going through the interior, not to repeat myself too much.
This is a quite successful design, where I have only objections about the cumbersome middle tunnel.
I would like to welcome a little more design design where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and the times are over, where we may complain about too short seats or headrests.
The side-stop has also improved significantly compared to 206.
As far as space is concerned, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the body here.
In the combi, the lack of head freedom mentioned above is also eliminated.
Suitcases in the trunk
The main thing about this car is the loading room.
I must call it a very good loading and space-saving (also because of the retractable back window).
The cave rooms are equipped with a holding garden that is an ideal compromise.
They do not interfere, can be pulled apart and also hold heavier objects.
But let's talk about the load volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment, it is 428 litres, which is a rather average value compared to competition.
However, not compared to the most sold vehicle in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
When we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot is clearly 52 litres behind.
This value is already critical for a holiday abroad or when a baby's car is invited.
But in order to highlight the positiva, I still have to mention the very flat loading room or the very low loading edge after the back seats are folded.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with engine capacity 1.6 litres and an output of 88 kWp.
And to be honest, this is what a 1600-cubic engine should look like, driving a family hatchback.
It is quiet, has a low consumption and is moving away well.
If I compare him with his counterpart at Škoda, who sometimes works as if his exhaust was blocked with a rag, then I can only be thrilled by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not very popular.
But we have to remember that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400s petrol engine of 329900 kroner is still on.
With our engine it costs from 410900 kroner, which is already quite a lot.
The premium of the test car is once again with 80000 kroner in addition to beech.
However, we had kopfairbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen wiper release, electric window levers in the back and...
The total cost of the car is 531900 kroner.
This is a lot, but you can calculate the additional equipment of a Fabia and you will arrive at a very similar amount.
So the only thing left is to decide which brand you want to choose.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools does not succeed
In British schools, the number of children from countries of Eastern Europe is increasing, which causes local fears about the further development of local education.
The integration of the Eastern European population has so far been faced with a number of obstacles.
British schools even identify cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants increase in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools is very much illustrated by the case of North Kent, where the conflicts between local and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
In the case of children, there is no reason to believe that this is the case.
The situation has already developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended himself with the boy insulting her with racist harassment.
The police also had to intervene on a Slovak immigrant after an attack by two minor girls.
The girls had allegedly made racist comments to the man and threw him with stones.
"When we went home, a boy climbed on a bus house and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw us with apples and pears and then exposed his buttocks, "a mother of Slovak students in the newspaper The Times described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even called the fight for survival with the immigrants from Eastern Europe.
The cases mentioned show that the mood between local and immigrant people in British schools is getting more and more tense.
In the UK, 70,000 Slovaks have been reported, who came here to seek work.
Some 30000 Slovak students are therefore visiting British schools.
Cuba - most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, that will be fulfilled if you only choose the right thing.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet as a pond.
Palms and All Inclusive with waiters who offer pizza, ice cream and stunning cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this to a large extent.
But only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye has ever seen.
Havana once became a camp or transit camp of treasures that the Spaniards had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the end of the 20th century.
It was built by one of the leaders of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the US (especially during the prohibition) was seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among others
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise houses grew, over the wide boulevards were driving cars, which were among the cult symbols of the fifty years of the past century.
Ernest Hemingway bought an estate in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht lying.
Stars of show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
And today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
At the bar at the Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails as you like.
And the cult cars of the fifties are going around in Havana to this day, because the once imported Shigulis and Fiats have already fallen apart in the salty and humid air.
May Havana, in particular its oldest part, have come down strongly, and nowhere in the area you can find as many wonderful colonial sights as just here.
Other places are being cleaned out, for example Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism is making the most of the money needed, there was a green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have been created not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another Marotte that is unique in the world and especially attracts railway lovers.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam and diesel-operated narrow track tracks to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see a rich and fully functioning locomotive that has been in the museum for a long time.
Excursions
The most important places do not leave out the majority of visitors to Cuba.
So you don't have to write about Varadero or Havana in detail anymore.
Only to mention that there is a museum in the already mentioned Hemingways estate, the visit of which should not be missed by the person who likes this writer.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on limestone.
The mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, in their hollow areas the fertile soil gathered, through which also weathered rock areas are covered by dense vegetation.
This valley is where the perhaps best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form you can meet him when you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
It may also seem interesting that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spaniards colonized the island.
Glory and wealth brought her the trade in slaves and sugar.
The wealth was embodied in the beautiful beauty of the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountains, is such a remote place that there was no road that would have connected the area to the rest of the country in the 1950s.
This insulation contributed to the fact that it was not respected.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was torn down, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than an afternoon time for Trinidad, it is worth looking at interesting places in the area, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the "valley of sugar factories."
In the evening one should then go to the Casa de la Música, which is reviving after the darkness, and where the music does not remain silent until the morning.
Baracoa
This town in the east of Cuba calls some of them the most beautiful of the island.
This view is certainly also influenced by the path to it.
Both roads that lead from Guantánamo must overcome high and tiled mountains and run through a landscape that is hardly touched by human intervention.
This eastern subpost of Cuba included UNESCO in its world heritage directory thanks to its untouched nature there.
The best chocolate is made there, in the church you can see the cross of Columbus (in fact it was created about a hundred years after the trips of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the present hotel El Castillo, is located, several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
Over the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountains, the Pig Bay and the island of Isla de Pinos, over the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, over the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves confess, many pages could be written about this.
But, as they say, look better with their own eyes.
allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
According to the United States, too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment influence the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should design a concrete plan for the next few years, according to the words of Minister of Defence Robert Gates.
The mission in Afghanistan was not in line with its ideas, and the representatives of the countries that have deployed units in the south of the country agreed on this in the Scottish Edinburgh.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban, the eight participating States are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its defence minister Robert Gates, called NATO units to more activity, the United Kingdom sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development aid.
"In Afghanistan, a forward development is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable the inhabitants to start their own development of the economy and security, "says British Minister of Defence Des Browne of the BBC.
Ninety percent
According to the American army, the activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest level for five years.
The number of acts of violence increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, and even by 60 percent in the southern province of Helmand.
The NATO countries have deployed about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached an absolute limit on the organisation and equipment of the units.
In concrete terms, they call for further helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the specific objectives for the next time and how we can achieve them," said Gates.
Today, the Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hope, expressed a similar opinion.
"I am not pleased with what we have available in Afghanistan on land and in the air.
We have about 90% of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that is too little, "said De Hoop of the Agency Reuters at the end of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
The countries involved have been fighting over the last few months about whether all the allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
For example, Germany was criticised for its passivity.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country, "said Gates.
This week, the British "Sun" was the name of the German soldiers as a lair.
"Afghan Non-Stuer Determines: The Germans are playing games while our boys are fighting," wrote the "Sun" in a post that was supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German image was turned over to the counter-attack and printed a picture of a British unit in a rugby competition in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt will be high on a trillion in 2009
Each Czech has a government debt of 84000 kroner.
The total debt increased to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
The government had planned to make a debt of 159.2 billion dollars this year.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the better development of public budgetary policy.
The Czech Republic's government debt increased to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its information on the government debt from the beginning of October.
Each Czech has a debt of 84000 kroner.
Over the past year, the state owed itself more than 111 billion kroner.
"To date, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not exceed the limit of a trillion crowns until 2009.
Next year, the debt should move between 900 billion and a trillion kroner, "said David Marek, analyst of Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
It is similar to Vladimir Pikora, analyst of the Next Finance: "We could come to the overrun of a trillion in the course of 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next budget we do not know.
If the situation on the political stage changes, and politicians should be ready to save more, this could take until 2010.
But I do not assume such a change, "he said.
Debt growth
The government debt comes from the government's debt and comes mainly from the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The government debt is financed by Treasury orders, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, by European Investment Bank bonds.
The domestic debt has now increased to 719.4 billion kroner this year.
The government's foreign debt has now increased by 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable government debt reached 803.3 billion kroner at the end of September and since June fell by 13.7 billion.
The average maturity of government debt increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased by 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really a lot given how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting that the growth is mainly in debt securities, where the increase is 20%.
It is bad that debt is increasing, but on the other hand, it shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes, "Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the handling of government debt for 2007 show that the government had planned this year to take up 159.2 billion crowns.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kroner thanks to the better development of government budgetary policy.
This amount is mainly due to the government budget deficit, which this year will obviously reach 76 billion kroner instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
This is also the maximum amount of funds allocated to the consolidation agency of 13.3 billion kroner, a ten billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of public debt securities of 43 billion and the rate of the loans to the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion.
For giving a name to a teddy bear, she was brought to a court in Khartum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher accused in Sudan of insulting Islam was sentenced on Thursday evening by a court in Khartum to 15 days in prison and subsequent expulsion.
The British was accused of allowing six to seven year-old students to give a teddy bear the name Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
She would have deserved to be bullied.
After several complaints by the parents of students from the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old primary school teacher who worked at the Unity High School of Khartum was taken up at home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code.
In fact, this matter takes its beginning in September, when the teacher asks her six to seven year-old students to choose a name for the classic eddy.
The children propose eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports head of the school Robert Boules.
After all, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as the favorite first name.
Certainly, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all also a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the image signature My name is Mohammed.
The bear itself had no sign with this name, but the problem is quite simple that the representation of the Islamic prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who taught at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well, and she would never have done anything to make her come near a religious faith, I only regret that she has asked the children to vote for a name, and he believes that this is just an innocent mistake.
An opinion that shares many students of the teacher who describe it as very attentive to her students and as a person who never speaks of religion in the class.
It is remembered that the first name of Mohammed is also the second name given in the United Kingdom, for which there are 14 different forms of writing in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered to be a kind of devotion to the Prophet (it is often given to the first-born of a family).
But what are the rules on the use of this first name?
Can you give it to a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, at the last negotiating meeting in Vienna, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and final discussion meeting on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their controversy about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not reach agreement on the status, the European intermediary Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace is at stake in the region, his American counterpart Frank Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina called for their commitments to maintain peace and continued the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
There are no expected acts of violence in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added and indicated that there are quite clear tensions.
End of the conciliation on 10 December
The troika's mediators, which the European Union, the US and Russia are united in themselves, will meet one last time on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province, which is 90% of Albanian-speaking, could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-KHartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiating meeting since the Troika had been commissioned by the UN last August for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked Kosovo's independence from the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this end date.
Russia was and remains advocates of a negotiated solution, a consensual solution, said Botswana-KHartchenko.
One-sided declaration of independence?
After eight years of Kosovo under the administration of the UN, the Western countries consider independence under EU supervision to be the only solution with the future.
Pristina is ready to announce them unilaterally if the Security Council should not decide on their behalf.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, the President of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations were held in the last chance since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, shared his regret.
He added, however, that the plan proposed by Belgrade belongs to the autonomy of a past that has led to murders and deportations.
Domino effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, felt that a compromise had always been sought and warned the Albanian majority of Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly a "domino effect" in a region that has been weakened so much by the wars of independence in the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision be taken alone and alone in the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto right.
The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word
Only a decision from the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end up the way they started: in the Security Council.
The journalists were told by Fatmir Sejdiu that the Kosovo Parliament would have the last word on the status, and added that any unilateral declaration of independence will be made by the Albanian-speaking population in coordination with the Western countries.
Bush is launching an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the International Peace Conference, which was held in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do anything to help them conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructure and Israel must stop its colonization work, Bush said, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the peace roadmap they had agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities under Abbas, at the end of the day, are seeking a peace treaty to resolve all open issues without exception, including the central issues.
This term covers the three serious problems which are mainly affecting the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees who were expelled from their home in the course of the 1948 conflict, which is in the present state of Israel.
After the American President, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be conducted in a comprehensive, thorough manner and provide for a settlement for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert took the floor, he committed himself to the forthcoming ceasefire negotiations being conducted directly and without interruption and to making an effort to end them before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of its vision of two states, one Palestinian and one Israeli, which exist alongside each other, for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that Bush has received an assurance in this sense from Bush before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has launched a plan taken over by all Arab countries to offer Israel peace, in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab areas occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis is a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects, says the Saudi-Arab Prince in his interview with the Arab-speaking daily newspaper financed by Saudi funds.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this kind of local news, official versions and rumors are opposite.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation by the National Disciplinary Authority of the Police (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 5 pm, a police car on the Rue Louise-Michel was headed towards Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no use, but was on strike, and drove at 40-50 km / h, without blue light, a spokesman of the police explains.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, without approval, i.e. not released for public road transport (see below), came, controlled by two young people without a helmet, at very high speed.
It ramped the left side of the police car after it had disrespected its advance from the right, a police officer explained.
The alcohol control carried out on the passenger of the vehicle is much negative.
The state of the car (bulkhead, split windshield, ripened bumper) is evidence of the force of the impact.
Very quickly, as early as yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation into the "facts of the involuntary murder and the lack of assistance to persons in danger," in coordination with the main public security department of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor said that she would exclude the investigation of the IGPN at this stage from the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident that were heard on Sunday evening have confirmed the version of the police, namely that this small-scale trade has reached their left-hand side relatively quickly.
Yesterday, a kind of rills, certainly caused by the friction of the footbars on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had been hacked together until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical review.
The bodies of the two victims were observed yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor was quickly made that the police had left the scene very quickly, and that without helping the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very careful, it would exclude this matter from any serious error.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigation that further investigations are needed and in which one must be very careful.
Libération has met an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows, he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, tells this witness.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disrupted police officer who was down.
Two others tried to revive one of the young people, the fourth on the phone.
In view of the tension that had quickly formed around the event and, as it seems, because of the certainty that the people present had about the unhoped situation of young people, the police were taken in the car by colleagues who had arrived at the accident site.
Still according to this testimony, the rescue forces arrived about 20 minutes after the police left.
They also used heart massages, but in vain.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police forces did not help the young people.
First aid has been given to these young people.
The fire department came right away.
Everything was done to try to save her, the prosecutor himself stressed.
In Pakistan, the tension increases
On Monday, the Pakistani police have defeated the first demonstrations since two days before the call of the emergency by General Musharraf.
According to evidence, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers, who demonstrated against the measures taken in the context of the emergency, were injured by the tear gas grenades used by the order forces there.
They then threw stones at them, with which they hurt the police.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
There were similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
Several would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court's attorney have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of opposition, human rights defenders and lawyers during the weekend.
Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the assembly.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (middle) and Peshawar (northeast).
The lawyer's movement received on Monday the support of the religious parties united in the powerful alliance of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose President called on the people to send flowers to the judges who have spoken against the emergency, and to those who have taken an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise no longer applies
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced Saturday evening.
In the following days he had to take a position on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct election on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was relieved and replaced.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the magistrate of the newspaper The News said.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to give the upper command of the army and to become a civilian president is no longer valid since the call for an emergency, said the Vice-Minister for Information Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform by 15 November, the date on which his first term as President ended.
The Vice-Minister for Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government disagreed with the rumours in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned a place of residence by his deputy army leader.
More than a third of pregnancies are still not planned
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the New Economy Act, which allowed contraception in France, one of three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the different methods of contraception such as the pill or the spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of pill users between 20 and 40 years of age using the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalisation of contraception has nevertheless enabled better control of fertility.
In any case, eight out of ten births are now carefully planned.
In one of five pairs, even exactly calculated for the month, and, if possible, in the spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will have taken more than seven hours in space to carry out the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector that is essential for the continuation of the scientific work on the station.
A bold exit that, due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools made by astronauts to carry out the repair, has achieved several records.
The problem occurred on Wednesday, when the astronauts had unloaded the Harmony module from the space ferry Discovery, a large cylindrical part, which is soon to take up the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratories.
But you have to be able to supply them with power.
The second task of the crew was to implement a 17.5 ton module for the generation of electricity through solar collectors, which was already on the ISS, in order to bring it into its final position.
After she had moved it, the crew made the restructuring of the solar panels of the module, the range of which is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors that can be seen as accordion was damaged by a clamp-in cable on a length of about one meter.
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collector any more.
The astronauts, who were originally to leave the space ferry Discovery for one control course and then repair another solar collector, whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around at the end of the 30-metre remote-controlled arm of the space ferry that had been installed at the station to carry out the repair.
He is one of NASA's best space walkers.
Large, resistant, very clever, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old trained doctor was therefore selected to operate the injured solar collector.
After he had carefully examined the damage, he severed the faulty cable and fixed some kind of rail on the damaged site.
He was supported by a second space walker, who remained close to the lock, and, from inside, from the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey bat, wrapped with insulator to prevent an electric blow on the solar collectors that generate several hundred volts, had the astronauts on board the station designed and built.
When the action was finished, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector had completely folded before he counted his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day's relaxation before today seven astronauts returned to the space ferry Discovery to start the return flight to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned on the stock exchange
After the aviation and defence group has announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to counter the A400M residues, the EADS share is currently showing a significant decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The Group was forced to re-examine its business forecasts for 2007, referring to the residues caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which delay the aircraft's maiden flight.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of their military aircraft amount to between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion for Airbus, announced the European manufacturer EADS's parent group.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new business performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 in the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, adding without further details.
The group also states that the assessment of the new costs is related to the six-month lag.
To remind you that the business performance of EADS fell from 86% in 2006, due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, the very large carrier A380.
The group had originally planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of status quo
On Sunday it will not be exciting when counting the urn: the mass of the Russians will choose President Putin's party, United Russia.
After a very repulsive campaign, she confirms her desire for stability, even for authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message to the voters, who have already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He does this in his capacity as a leading candidate of the United Russia, the Pro-Kremlin Party, for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, the President had nothing to see through when he received the foreign ambassadors, and was satisfied with providing a new point of attack against the Western powers accused of interference - his favorite theme during the election campaign.
We know the price of a true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have made a mistake.
It denies a campaign of oppression.
The Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there has never been such a dirty election, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, former chess world champion Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days in prison, according to his lawyer continues to be prohibited from visiting.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections without any tension, two more questions arise:
Who will be the president of Putin's successor?
The official newspaper announced yesterday the date of the first election of the presidential elections, March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
As he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot stand for a third consecutive mandate.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chairman of the majority of Parliament and the omnipotent party of United Russia, the government and president will choose?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary or presidential elections, the power to date will triumph.
It's tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus, they are not the master of their fate, says the sociologist Lev Goldkov, director of the independent centre of Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov from the State University of St. Petersburg is even further back: civil society in this country, which has been christianized five centuries after Europe, has developed very slowly; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has once again linked to the model of a paternalist state, which was fully accepted by the population, all the more because this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic prosperity, Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians, free of any personal responsibility they have given to the USSR after the collapse of the USSR.
Why think about it for a long time?
This phenomenon concerns all social groups, including the business world.
And the administrative elite understand to keep the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional leaders) lead the local electoral lists of the United Russia.
The new freedom coming from the West is often the same as chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: Why think about it for a long time?
Those who are in power are not so bad as to why they are to be replaced?
A heavy memory
After being treated confidentially for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are located at a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, have not been seen until now, except with a humanitarian intention, that is, individual and name-related, that is to say to ask a former victim or his family.
The 11 states responsible for their administration - including Germany, France, Israel and the US - agreed in May 2006 to make them available to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Healthy information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will enable research to be carried out, in particular through the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of the concentration camps and the state of health of forced workers, Reto Masters, the head of these archives, which are managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several countries, including Germany, have been opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public because of the delicate nature of certain information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The inmates' lists of the concentration camps or the arrest orders issued by the Gestapo had been brought together for a practical reason after the war: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and to provide them with possibly evidence of their arrest in order to pave their way to their compensation.
Even today, in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent, tens of thousands of personal requests are processed.
However, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
It is not possible to expect anything fundamental new in these documents, but it was stated in 2006 that Fr. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Centre for Antisemitism at the Technical University of Berlin.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008.
At present, the mutual trade between India and Europe is already reaching the EUR 60 billion a year.
The EU is India's main trading partner and represents 18% of its external trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, stated that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU Foreign Ministers had given the European Commission a green light last April to open negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean).
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the European Commission, India is only the ninth trading partner of the EU.
A free trade pact will make a huge contribution to the two economic areas and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans, confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products by India, the European Commissioner said. The Asian and European giants exchange goods worth EUR 47 billion per year and services worth EUR 10 billion, this week Daniéle Smadja, President of the European Commission in New Delhi, said, and regretted that the mutual trade has not yet exhausted its potential. The EU and India meet on Friday to their eighth diplomatic in New Delhi, where Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission will be present José Manuel Barrasso.

The Bank of England takes note of the concern and offers £10 billion for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England was concerned about reducing the current recurring concern about credit conditions, and announced a bid of £10 billion with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
In order to mitigate the fears that the conditions in the financial market will be particularly hard at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they are to organise their liquidity positions at that time, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its savings during the maintenance phase beginning on 6 December, in the form of an open market operation for five weeks, it shall state in a communication.
The Bank further states that in this way, on 6 December, at 12.15 GMT, 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put into circulation, at the base rate and only until 10 January.
This seems to be the first time the BoE has put liquidity into circulation for five weeks in an open market operation.
This usually happens for a week.
In its communication, the BoE adds that it is prepared to take further measures in order to obtain the different interest rates of the intermediary lending with its basic interest rate from day to day.
The interbank interest rate, which varies from day to day, was 5,829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has been set at 6.6%, slightly higher since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums put into circulation by the Bank of England have been linked to criminal charges which had prevented the banks from using them.
According to some rumours, reinforced by the development of the fund rate in contrast to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums put into circulation by the European Central Bank, to more favourable interest rates and with more secure discretion
UMP and NC refuse to review PS's proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
The text produced in the framework of a socialist niche (meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary group) indicated about ten measures adopted on Wednesday by the PS National Committee, of which the majority of them were 50% on the employment allowance, the re-introduction of the TIPP flotante, a transport check or the limitation of rents.
After UMP and NC voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which gave rise to some serious changes of words between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before the television contribution by Nicolas Sarkozy on purchasing power.
The leader of the members of the PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would present the whole of its proposals as an amendment to the legislative proposal for the correction of finances, which had been examined by the Assamblee last week.
A new festival is born
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter / producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in cooperation with the Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, no longer and no less, has served as a model for the current festival movement in America, told Charlie Jones from C3 on Bilboard.com.
C3 is the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival will probably take place from August 8-10 on a 500 Acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The head of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the world's most prestigious festivals.
In 1989 he took over the lead of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people every year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also been a co-owner of the production, licensing concessions and organisational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he's ever been to, says that his company and Melvin Benn's work in parallel to each other to offer the area a European-style festival event.
We have selected Philadelphia as a market and are working with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We had negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have been stuck in policy debates about the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival in an exceptional place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents has brought the Lollapalooza Festival back to life in the Grand Park Chicago in 2005, after it has been working together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the world of festivals in 2002.
The two events were able to reach $9.8 million in 2007 and $11.8 million in gross tax assets.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, while the one that we are more interested in is on the urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to merge these two concepts in one way or another, in order to present at the same time the impression of a rural festival in the European and an urban way in the American way."
Vineland is about half way between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, is taking on the burden of this event with joy," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to include a festival that will hopefully have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the recording capacity of the festival is "very large," in about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of viewers," says Charlie Jones.
His partners from C3, who received the top independent promoter prize of the last Bollboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal is meeting the terminator.
Not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal, if no one is less than the terminator.
These loose tests are among the delegates' tasks.
A political "delicate mandate," because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denies the "Runaway Productions."
Is it difficult to negotiate with the "governor"?
"You have to be careful, because it's the industry that decides where it's going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those you think are the best, "he says.
The run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, at the moment, the main priority is to bring the cinema there to the fore.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all the festival on the West Coast, even though Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about presenting the films from Quebec, assessing them and ensuring that producers give interviews.
The dark age had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock exchange ahead of a final year rally? Disagreement with the experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With just under five weeks to the annual financial statements on the stock exchange, investors are already taking their hands on the coming end-year rally.
However, the experts cannot produce safe forecasts in this respect.
Banif believes that purely statistical, the month of December on the stock exchange is usually accompanied by a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to make forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics, especially if serious tensions are to be taken into account in determining the current market situation.
Although other experts do not support such a strong increase in the rate in the last few weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that the exchange rate is determined by the given liquidity of the market and of the market participants, which, due to the lack of secure equity funds, mainly invest in pension funds, which are heavily affected by the revaluation trend towards assets.
As a result, these experts believe that the stock exchange will have a rather lateral short-term trend, which is influenced by market fluctuations, especially because we are not yet able to estimate the extent of the possible fall in the US central bank's interest rate, an uncertainty which is mainly due to the increased price of crude oil and the risk of the rise in inflation.
Javier Barrio, President of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a good time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its highest brand on 8 November of 15.945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, Ibex 35 could successfully complete the year with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional grant of the pension fund every year.
However, the expert points out that this year things could develop slightly differently, especially because of the final year rally that took place in the second week of December, and therefore right after the bridge day on the day of the Constitution.
In the view of the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at the Bank Inversis, the previous market situation assessments are at an almost technical level, which could lead to a deviation from the index values which are likely to depend on the impact of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these will be positive.
In the selection of the values that the Ibex should promote to new levels, the analysts agree.
Solana from Intermoney is convinced that the great values are on the line this year.
The value-winners would include the two large banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of the Bank Inversis assures that the increases in connection with the banking and industrial sector will be accompanied.
If the Rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACS has been on a catching-up course in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will take the same path, the expert says.
With regard to the increased consumption behaviour during Christmas days, market events will be determined in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only in a small number represented on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has only had two falling course courses.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, this led the stock exchange out of its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real end-year rally.
This year, in which Ibex 35 picked up 28.17 percentage points, December saw a rise of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth year in a row (Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and will also be able to show a final year's rally.
Popular will have opened its 200 credit institutions from Monday to Friday 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernise a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of them are located in the most economic regions of Spain.
For the Institute, which operates under the name Popular Max, these branches are a major milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, since Popular is the first group of banks to be the first to start the opening hours of its branches on weekdays to 20.30h and to start on Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The BBVA banking group, which also repeated the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet made a definitive decision.
The Bank's current negotiations with the trade unions seem to be aimed at an agreement, with 75% of all branches being closed on Saturday and open for this on a day of the afternoon, if not for the customer.
Whether other banks will join the new initiative that will adapt to business opening times will depend on the experience of the Popular Bank.
And this is also the intention of the popular with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches which, because of their situation, can cover the commercial customers of their own, small and medium-sized enterprises, but also those of large stores.
The Bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as these are not new but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the Bank will redesign the premises of those branches that are already in business zones, while at the same time adapting them to the individual customer profile of the different zones.
The extension of the opening times is linked to a new space design of the branches, which is characterized by a more up-to-date, more colourful design.
The competent bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring would not require major investments but would be accompanied by an increased recruitment of staff, as a branch now no longer needed six but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, says Ángel Rivero.
The offices of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donell and Gran Vía have been selected for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently runs about 2500 branches.
And another 60 who operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and public holidays.
The model of the BBVA is not used in these branches of PopularMax, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to be competitive for our customers, explains Rivero.
With Telefonica they have provisionally reached the agreement to sell mobile phones with the help of external bank staff.
The Spanish private channel Telecom is doubling its stock exchange value for the first time and is thus overtaking its rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this set, the managing director of Telecom, Paolo Vasile, announced his satisfaction at the closing of the stock exchange. The channel he led had increased its value by twice its rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: that's exactly what's hurt me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that, despite the weak market, they did not fall too far.
Telecom ended the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its losses to 15.66% this year.
According to Bloomberg, the company's value now reaches the EUR 4.488.88 million, with Mediaset controlling the main share of capital (52%), and Vocento is only 13% involved.
The rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has been reporting a total loss of 40.5% since January, so its market value is 2,193.46 million to half.
On the other hand, the market value of other listed communications companies increases; in the case of Sogecable to 3,571 million, in the case of Prisa (editor of the magazine Cinco Días) to 2,518.53 million and in the case of Vocento to 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that these are two similar companies, Vasile says.
The question still seems uncertain as to the extent to which we can actually act on the market, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at the customer level.
A week ago, Telecom declared its intention to go up to the first television station this year with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising, which was assured by Guiseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecom and Public Services, the group's advertising company.
If the project were to be implemented, the channel would increase its advertising income by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net turnover increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the stock exchange (up to 734.4 million), while net income from the TV business could only increase by 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor for the better flow of telecinco compared to the market, is that the analysts see the high payout ratio that the company could have up to the present time: in 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarría caused a 100% dividend payout.
However, Vasile assures that the ratio may still vary after the purchase of 33% of the shares of Endemol, with Mediaset as a parent company, even if it is still too early for official notification.
We are obliged to pay at least 50% of the shares to the official compromise, even if we have said much more and more so far.
I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we have already been able to increase by buying 33% of the final shares.
According to the analysts, the market currently has certain loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecom by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This was the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will fall from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This also reduced the expected profit calculation of Atena 3 by 4.5% in 2008 and by 7.5% in 2009.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: relies on its high effective return and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: As a result of the multiple incentives and the prosperous market, Telecinco measures a more advantageous position than Antena 3 (hold).
3.
JPMorgan: recommends to reduce expectations in both cases in view of similar threats (saturated market and worse economic climate)
Congress agrees with the MIFID directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel to the parliamentary preparation, which today ended with the Congress decision in the Senate on the additional / amendments to the project, the government published the provisions resulting from the new law with a view to allowing the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of the congressmen and senates, who in their negotiations and votes had the aim of establishing the best possible arrangements to ensure the security of investors and to regulate the individual business activities in order to ensure a generally efficient market event.
In addition to the modernisation of financial markets, the MIFID, which redefines the Securities Services Regulation, aims to improve investor protection, increase the control right of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and promote cooperation between the various European Union control authorities.
The new Directive allows for the provision of financial advice to both specialised companies and to natural or legal persons, and also contributes to the creation of new financial services companies (ESIS), the advisory companies which are involved with the investment and mediation companies of securities.
It also extends the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions, so that regulated circulation markets are added to the multilateral systems of securities business and to the systems for the internationalisation of trade contracts, which would eventually compete with the current economic operators.
The law requires investment companies to publish the focus of their business profile, the confrontation and the forms of dealing with risks on the market and to register all the projects carried out in order to facilitate the control of the CNMV.
The Economic Commission of the Congress provided for further changes after that, with the decision that the title-issued bond must now be considered as complex financial resources for the investor due to its high degree of risk, the US mortgage and banking crisis has confirmed itself. (US mortgage crisis)
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal definition of the areas of work of diplomitic economists was used; 30 years after 1977, the regulation, which restricted the areas of work reserved for the economic scientists, was adopted.
The Senate, for its part, set new positions in the financial sector, as the economic media working on a foreign account does not require authorization from the CNMV and can at the same time offer its services for the commercialisation of products and for the production of customers several investment companies.
The harmonised consumer price index (CPI) increased by five-tenth in November and is now 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the inflation rate within the European Union provides the average price trend in Spain in November.
Its publication is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which seek to compare local and quality to US products by providing the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be prepared in advance by applying the same approach as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) warned that the pre-determined indicator would only serve as a reference value and therefore did not have to be in line with the final result, which will be announced on 14 December.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to Deputy Head of Government and Minister of Economic and Financial Affairs Pedro Solbes, the increase in the CPI was a temporary development in November, while at the same time ensuring that the price index would remain relatively high in the coming months.
However, Solbes found in the halls of the Congress building that even if the present number is not good, the inflation difference between Spain and the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also said that in November there were less surprises than in the previous month, where the government did not expect such a high increase.
We expected a value of about 4%, the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs announced with regard to the forecast published today.
Virgin expects Northern Rock revenues of over 42 billion euros in the next three years
Northern Rock's assets have fallen by more than half after the Bank had asked the UK central bank for an emergency loan in mid-September last year, and now it is only £12,000 million (equivalent to EUR 16.800 million).
At that time, the Bank's assets amounted to a record-bearing 25,000 million pounds, a sum that has fallen significantly within two and a half months due to the loss of customers' confidence and, despite the government's 100% guarantee that the money is safe, will continue to fall until the end of the crisis.
The company Virgin, which would continue the group after the acquisition under the brand name Virgin Money, must make about a quarter of the British banks' income from the facilities of the next three years, in order to acquire exactly the 18 billion pounds that are still needed to achieve their target of 30 billion.
The group of multi-millionaire Richard Branson, known for its striking advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to make £50,000 million (about EUR 70 million) flow annually into advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
This week, Northern Rock named the Virgin Group, in which three other companies are involved, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of insolvency.
The mayor of Totana arrested for alleged suspicion of participation in urban corruption
This morning, the Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the town of Totano (Partido Popular), because of the urgent suspicion of urban corruption that was discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo represented Juan Morales last May, currently a member of the Popular Party and at the time Chairman of the Municipal Council of Totana, and could, according to information from the radio station Cadena SER, be the original director of the plot.
The officials continue to search the business records of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not rule out further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer was accused of the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered at the beginning of this week.
According to the information of the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular and therefore privileged Member Juan Morales was arrested on leaving his client's place of residence on the basis of important burdensome documents that are to be related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information from the alleged order payments of Morales report to a Galician construction company which provided for the conclusion of a city-building contract in which the construction of a 200-hectare area was decided.
At the moment, eight people are in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the PSOE's candidacy in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory, in Congress.
Former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, and will therefore lead the list of PSOE candidates in the forthcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of a victory of the Socialists, take over the office of President of the Congress.
In this way, José Blanco, the organization secretary of the PSOE, and Bono announced it in the press conference, after a meeting with Zapatero took place today at the party's headquarters.
The head of government considers that the offer to the former minister is justified because it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the forthcoming elections, the Mancha politician would appear to be the chairman of the Congress for the Party.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as the President of the Congress, who had announced last November that he would not take part in the next general elections, that he would end his career in public policy, and that he would instead work in the university area for climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the President of the Government had constantly pressed for his return to political action.
He also pointed out that, as with the appointment of the Vice-President for Economic Affairs, the party did not want to prevent citizens from taking over the post of President of Congress in the event of a victory, and this was an act of transparency.
If he should actually take over the office, he hopes to turn the board into a house of respect, not of insult or of the story, in order to make it more and more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time, one gets the impression that the only place in which one cannot speak quietly and quietly in Madrid is Congress; so the President of the Senate was interrupted once up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Martín and his good work and said that he did not want to make the appearance of having already taken over the office, otherwise his political opponents would call it arrogance.
Climate propaganda
As the climate debate is being criticised by both the sceptics of climate change and those who put a social and political debate in the foreground in this respect, the movement as a whole must show strong cohesion.
Especially when it is a leader of the movement, which, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change to be more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
This proposal, however, brings it to an end in the need for action or non-action by its government, which has made a significant contribution to the fact that Spain is at the top of the countries that have least met the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol within the EU.
Who is responsible for the failure to meet the requirements on which sectors this is due, and why has his government, which had proposed the Treaty with the planet, not stopped this development.
He is also now forced to present to the Spanish citizens the measures he has planned to take to combat climate change without delay.
What companies will be affected by this, what behaviour of citizens will be changed, what individual and collective austerity measures will have to be implemented and what economic consequences it will have.
More precisely, who has to sacrifice himself and pay for saving the planet.
However, there is and will not be any such explanations in the future.
Just because it's about the sacrifice and the payment.
The measures that can be used in real terms against climate change are unpopular.
They are expensive, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the petrol cent proposed by the PSOE, Zapatero appeared to be in a strategic position to be so dangerous that he was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, that is, with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the otherwise suitable politician for election campaigns must neither speak, nor accuse, nor call for, but instead to follow the demanding issue, to decorate the meetings and to inspire others with his meticulous and kindness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not imply that the bike will become the only means of transport in the future, or if we are only allowed to refresh with one subject.
The mayor and the police chief of Totana due to an alleged involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the town of Totana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. In addition, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel operator were detained because of the alleged suspicion of urban-building violations, it was said today from the investigation circles.
The city council was arrested at his residence, from where he was taken to the municipal office and in whose premises he is still in, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the city administration and the municipal construction line Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the arrests that were already taking place in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid last Monday, where it was found that more than 2 million hectares of untapped construction land for urban construction projects should be redesigned under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria, which was to build 4000 apartments on the property after the local administration had received illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested directly, but were subject to an investigation procedure initiated and carried out by the first court of Totonas.
The first six prisoners were brought to the judge today.
According to the investigation circles, the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP MP Juan Morales are also being investigated.
In addition, his ex-wife, the owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend, who is resident in Murcia, are under suspicion.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria group, the Vigo lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the managing director of Suelo de Inmontar Pablo José M.G., whose company is to be a part of Nuaria and have received the bribe.
The investigation is carried out by the local authority against urban offences, under the supervision of the central unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, carried out 11 further searches, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas, Madrid and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regional-known poultry farming industry, which is supposed to have acted as a middleman.
The Nuaria group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in the town of Murcia, which should include more than 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired more than 2.2 million square kilometres of area in Totana, which had to be converted. The aim was to achieve a construction project that would raise the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, in Vigo, which operates the parking spaces of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activities are limited to the sector of direct marketing and Preconiza, specialising in the promotion, sale and installation of components.
Things that can happen

If you agree to this, we will turn away from the expression book of the month and instead try to invent a price name of other names with corresponding competences.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are cordially invited to make your proposals.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment published yesterday in the main Finnish newspaper, the Helsinki Sanomat (Finland, by the way, is at the top of the PISA study), which takes a position on the note published in the same newspaper on 18 November, which is due to happen on the day the issue of which included the criticism of the book Blackburn.
The content of the philosophy subject has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy about the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murders is an abitur who quoted the works of Platon and Nietzsche in his news.
The President of the Education Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, in an interview of the daily Helsinki Sanomat, called on teachers to take a more critical position against Platon and proposed to delete the teaching of Platon from the sublevel curricula for philosophy at high schools.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the criminal code:
A. The download of a song would be a breach of the law, which was taken six months in prison.
But if you rob a music business again below a value of 400 euros, this is only considered a simple infringement (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, the theft is classified as a criminal offence, but the penalty is less than a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it forty hours later, the penalty is still lower than when you download it (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than in a music data exchange.
To participate in a rebellious dispute is a prison sentence of three to 12 months after (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the exchange of data results in a six-month-to-two-year imprisonment.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment at work is considered less bad than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. The trade in copyright-protected films, whose authorisation has not been given by the authors, is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague is right, then someone has made his demands quite a bit.

My doctor gives me one of his long, strange research articles entitled: Money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially when the others get more of them.
So the feelings arising from the monthly salary payment depend on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was produced by a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn and the results were published in the last edition of the Science Journal.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Bonner Hirnforschungzentrum Life & Brain, the activation was the most powerful if the participant gave correct answers and his fellow player failed.
The researchers could see that the brain activity was always very moderate when both participants were correct with their response and received the same salary; but if one of them received the double, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure if it really requires so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The state prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been calling for the crimes of the Balkans for eight years. Her seat is in the prosecution's office of the former Yugoslavia's Criminal Court, based in La Haya.
Her mandate will end at the end of the year and Carla will leave office with a weeping and laughing eye, as the main leaders of the Srebrenica massacre - where eight thousand Bosnian Muslims were killed - the ex-General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbo-Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic continue to be on the loose.
Her names are on the list, which the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach presented for the title of his documentary film La Lest de Carla (2006, not yet launched in Spain); a film that, at the speed of a political thriller, follows the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in their attempt to track down the missing criminals and put pressure on their respective governments to tighten their networks.
Which insurance is best for me?
The KFZ insurance, which covers a possible case of damage caused by the driver, includes a high cost, the amount of which depends on various factors, including age, gender, time of production of the driving licence, family status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the appropriate KFZ insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, it must be clear to you what we are dealing with here.
A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurance company.
This agreement shall be signed in writing by means of an insurance contract which shall determine that the company will receive the agreed insurance premium and in return shall be obliged to submit the corresponding amount of the compensation in the event of damage.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance that is composed of several factors, including age, gender, time of drawing up the licence, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance undertakings set their prices according to the statistics, so that higher contributions are also due in the event of a higher risk of accident.
For this reason, both over 25-year-olds and women have to make less contributions, as statistics show that, due to their caution, these groups have a lower accident rate.
The same applies to married persons, as according to the statistical values and therefore also to the firm's conviction, they tend to suffer less accidents as a single person.
The benefit to the vehicle is affected by the frequency of the driving and therefore the probability of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
In drawing up the premium, insurance must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance that is most likely to meet his personal needs.
We now list the most important points that should be considered in the selection of insurance in order not only to make a performance but also a price-oriented choice.
The less than 25-year-olds encounter many obstacles in the choice of low-cost insurance, such as low driving practice and young drivers' licences.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance cover to be covered by full-cash insurance, there are still more expensive alternatives.
The cautious drivers can select a full-time cashier with self-participation, so that the services of a full-time insurance are covered but offered at a low price.
This type of contract means that the customer must pay part of the amount resulting from the damage itself.
The amount will be fixed before the contract is concluded and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher than the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, the main representative of Spain at First Europe, an online insurance intermediary.
Another option is the extended insurance, which insurance the customer against external accident damage, but not against the damage caused by his own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's a piece of advice.
When you are under 25 years old, it is in your hand to reduce the insurance costs; so your credit increases by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate of the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment involves an increase in the rates mentioned.
The amount of credit and penalty payments depends on the company and its income.
If the company has a profit-rich year, it may be able to increase the bonus payments, explains Noguera.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract, which is why the accident rate is falling with increasing driving practice.
It is therefore most appropriate to opt for full-scale insurance with self-participation.
Usually, young people cannot benefit from their experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, explains the Spanish head of the European company, and adds that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the fear of the beginner has been abandoned.
However, it is more advisable for a married customer who does not have children to complete full-cash insurance; of course, only if the financial situation of the person concerned allows it.
On the basis of the insurers, couples with children are considered to be the customers with the lowest accident rate and their contribution payments are therefore low.
In this case, a full-cash insurance with self-participation (with an amount of 300 euros) would be the best option. If you have received a high credit, an extended insurance that only uses for the third year of the vehicle is recommended.
They are more relaxed and have a greater purchasing power, which allows them to start a higher contribution payment, Luis Noguera notes.
For pensioners, it is possible to make a full-cash insurance with a self-contribution (with an amount of 150 euro) or an extended insurance that only uses in the event of a sufficiently high credit.
In the end, it must be noted that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage, but also because it has high costs that require a thorough selection that is in line with our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow hopes for the eighth final point in Milan
The FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will be fighting for the point that they are missing next Tuesday in San Siro to achieve their respective goals before the end of the championship league round. The Italians need the point to get to the top of their group, while the point is that they decide to take part in the Scots.
The Italian team already has five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with one indecision in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow needs another one with nine points to make sure that the Shakhtar FC does not catch up with the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two games of Group D will take place one week before the end of the sixth round of the game, as the Milan FC will have to join the FIFA World Cup in Japan, where he will fight for the first time in the semi-finals for the first time in the final, which will take place on the 16th.
In this way, this group will be completed before everyone else and the undecided in the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium will be the expected result, even if both teams are trying to win, because the Italians will not want to speculate at home the Keltik Glasgow knows that in the event of a victory they would be the first to have a better starting position in the eighth final.
The team of Gordon Strachan could be enough to win a defeat even in a sleep of the Shakhtar FC. However, he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because at nine points equal is the participation of the Ukrainians; they had lost in Glasgow last week (2-1) but could win in the second game (2-0).
Thus, the Milan will try to rent the evening to the Scots, hoping to reach the eighth final of the redesigned champion league for the second time in a row, after being defeated in the top season in exactly the same round by a goal of Kaka in the follow-up time (1-0) and by a zero to zero indecision on the play.
While Shakhtar is waiting for the Rossoneri to win, the team will have to focus on its own game, as both the achievement of the eighth final and its membership of the UEFA will depend on its victory and the defeat of the Celtic Glasgow.
In spite of its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the largest European championship, the Benfica Lisbon could win third place by winning the UEFA.
20,000 people visit the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls gave the start of their first tour after the band was dissolved in 2000 in the Canadian Vancouver.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) y "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) just before the start of their concert at the GM Place de Vancouver stadium, said that the mood in the reunited band was excellent.
Around the 20,000 people were able to experience the concert in the sold-out stadium, where a video on the history of the band, which had taken care of Furore at the end of the 1990s, was shown.
The reunion and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes its biggest hits and two other new songs, Headlines and Voodoo, which appears in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls carried golden bracelets on the stage, which the husband of Posh Spice, the English football player David Beckham, had previously given them.
The athlete was among the fan masses in the audience that made GM Palace glow, although the nerves of his wife Victoria had forbidden him in the previous days.
During the preparations for the show, Victoria Beckham made it clear that the British star has never even seen our wardrobe, and that's why I'm already very excited about what he's going to think of the performance.
Sporty Spice, whose resignation from the group in 1998 resulted in the dissolution of the group two years later due to internal differences of opinion, expressed her nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed, that the feelings about the Spice Girls had changed.
And that's why I thought why not; so I'm glad to have made this decision, Chisholm expressed his opinion on the separation of the band she had made nine years ago.
The singer also made it clear that the disputes were resolved and that they were all very much in favour of each other.
However, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of Spice Girls in 1998.
First of all, according to the report of the television station CTV, the group arrived in a special machine of Virgin Airlines in Vancouver.
On arrival at the airport, the band was received by an army of nannies.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will be next in California, San José (on the 4th of December) and Los Angeles (on the 5th and 7th of December).
In Madrid they will enter the stage on the 23rd of December.
New fears about natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute between Ukraine and Russia is in the process of increasing the risk of Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe being affected.
The majority of Russian natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) are led by Ukraine and every dispute between the two nations is very closely observed.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge higher transit charges from Russia.
A previous conflict between the two states last year reduced supplies to the EU countries.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow is happening at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine has to be charged more, as the Group has agreed to pay up to 50% additional for natural gas from the neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for the imports of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit countries in talks," said the Minister of Economic Affairs of Ukraine Anatoli Kinakh of the news agency Reuters.
"The changing prices of natural gas should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments on the level of transit fees [to Western Europe] through Ukraine."
In the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006 Gazprom reduced supplies to Ukraine.
This led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, which was a drastic increase in prices.
Russian gas is a quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas supply, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom supplements its own supplies of gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve the controls of the pre-trial registers for workers from outside Europe, said a member of the control body outside.
The recommendation of the Chief Financial Controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought together with the attack on the airport of Glasgow in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish State Health Service had no precise idea of the number of its foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important controls were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The main financial controller investigated personnel recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area as a result of the attack on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a ground car was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in the Old Bailey in October in a video transmission and was charged with the alleged car bomb attack in the UK.
The State Health Service is expected to carry out controls prior to the appointment of foreign employees to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorisations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review pre-criminal records, the Agency does not have the power to obtain this information outside the UK.
The report of the main auditor now states, among other recommendations, that the board should take up guidelines of the criminal record, which helps employers to control in different countries.
"Although we have found evidence of these controls in some staff documents, they have not been routinely carried out."
Black said that the Scottish health authorities would follow their investigation guidelines very much before they were appointed, but added: "Our report shows areas in which the system can be improved to ensure that precise information on the number of foreign health workers is available."
BMA Scotland President Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks prior to the appointment of potential NHS staff.
"The report states that the NHS Scotland is working well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of them doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number is likely to be higher, also because the board of directors have problems in identifying those employees who have been suspended for an indefinite period of time.
The investigation continued to establish that established control procedures of NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian were mainly observed.
This includes passport, work permit, and qualification controls.
the Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and guidelines for pre-employment controls for foreign staff in the NHS.
The Secretary of Health Nicola Sturgeon said, "I was concerned to do this work in the face of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
It added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines on control investigations prior to the appointment of all employees, including those from abroad, would be reflected next month.
Joy Division dominates film award ceremony
Control, the film biography about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, among others for the best film.
The award was also awarded to main actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before he was cast for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and co-actor Toby Kebbell.
Lady Judi Dench was awarded as the best main actress for the Thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Prize for bringing the British film to the world public.
The awards were given in a ceremony in the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis's rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black and white film - on the soundtrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was shot for only 3 million British pounds.
However, he has presented two awards to the Dutch photographer Corbijn, best known to date for the culinary cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree, as the best director and the best director.
Rock music was the center of another prize winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about the Clash singer Joe Strummer got the award for the best documentary film.
The award for the best actor was awarded to Viggo Mortensen for his role as driver of a Russian mafiabosse in David Cronenberg's London thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who is in the call to play hard guys, has picked up the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beist, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to get the award that was named in honor of the Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my type of man, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored. "
The independent film prices, known as bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organisers.
The bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nithy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it has arrested 208 militants for their belonging to cells that had planned an imminent attack on an oil plant as well as on the spiritual and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells planned to smuggle in missiles.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the TV report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000 man strong rapid intervention force to protect plants after a failed Al Qaeda attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to a domestic declaration, says that 18 of the prisoners were part of a cell led by a "rocket expert" who illegally entered the country.
He reports that the militants planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
According to the report, a further 22 of the prisoners were planning to kill the spiritual and security forces.
The government has warned the spiritual to do more to stop Saudis who are seeking Iraq to join Al Qaida militias who want to fight the Allied forces and the US-supported Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by the hardliners among the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaida militias consider many of the clerks in Saudi Arabia to be in cooperation with the authorities in support of the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaida leader born in Saudi Arabia to target the proWestern Saudi government - are looking for foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy sector installations.
"This was a very great effort by the security forces over the last... five months," a spokesman from the Ministry of the Interior told the state television.
The arrests also concerned a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to promote "Takfiri thinking" - the ideology of the radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims that are branded as unbelievers and renegade.
Among the prisoners were also 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could show a view of the future of the earth
The Venus was perhaps a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spaceship on a orbit show that the planet is even more like a turned-off twin of the Earth than it was ever aware of.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbour to the Earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and similar planetary pathways, but the Venus of the Sun is a little closer.
Billions of years ago, there would have been conditions on Venus that would have been very similar to those on Earth and could have been habitable, scientists believe today.
But because of the unbridled carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower rate of rotation, Venus took a completely different course of development.
Today the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express space probe, which has examined the plants for a year, offer a refreshing look at how the Earth could develop in the face of the catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Physics Department at Oxford University, one of the leaders of the Venus Express Mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, while otherwise the planets are quite similar."
"Our new data allows us to construct a scenario in which Venus started billions of years ago, possibly with a habitable environment."
"enriched uranium" seized by the police
A kilo of radioactive material, reported enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police speaker said that three people were arrested and that the material was being checked.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (£480,000).
All still open
Mitt Romeo said he didn't think it was worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the Presidency finally agreed to ask for a debate on YouTube, in which normal voters take up questions on video and submit them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, 28 November, were as ridiculous as the snowman, who questioned Democrats about global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time exactly reflected the state of the Republican party that is going to be in the elections next year.
It is not known, just like the producers of CNN who supported the debate with the selected YouTube clips to show the upcoming candidate.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, the longest of which was devoted to a single issue, immigration was the focus.
The subject is one of the most powerful issues for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undetermined voters to use a dial when they heard things that they liked: the TV station noticed the points of approval when the candidates spoke strictly about the borders.
The most sharp and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national leader, and Romney, who has moved forward in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to shake off the call that he had been very perplexing about illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his house.
The two were particularly concerned as to whether one of the candidates would support a "amnesty" (the illegal would give a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Unimportant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, were able to follow up on this subject.
None of the two men have serious chances of nominating, but both of them stay in the race, perhaps because they used to and harder than others on the immigration spell.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates share the same broad views: stronger borders, intolerance to illegal migrants.
This issue, together with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans to forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic when other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questions asked whether the candidates believe every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to the view that although the Bible is his preferred book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another question asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now in the first place in a recent survey in Iowa, despite all expectations, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressed to see whether Jesus would support them, he laughed at it and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains unusually wide open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul's recent fundraising and his incidental storms in the Wednesday debate.
These two have been shot out of nowhere because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more well-known and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party from the beginning with a victorious message about the size of America and a twinkling on both the wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall in; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly slippery.
No title seems to have been sold, no politician paid Paris hotel bills, no extra-marital toes have been sucked.
But the discovery that a rich businessman has spent more than £650,000 ($1.3 million) on the British ruling Labour Party under the name of other people for four years, and that the party has failed to report this is something that would have been good without the controversial Gordon Brown.
When two months ago the Prime Minister had withdrawn the call for a choice, in a stupid way insulting the intelligence of the British by claiming that opinion polls had not affected this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly sharp representative of the Liberal Democrats, expressed it, the once feared Brown from Stalin has developed into Mr. Bean.
The unskilful rescue of Northern Rock, a hit bank, showed regulatory weakness and bad judgment under fire.
Bad thought-out proposals to change tax laws have brought business associations against the government.
The tax loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative polluters.
A trio of retired generals started an uprising in the upper house in protest against cuts in military expenditure: to be Minister of the Armed Forces, they claimed to be a part-time job.
Now there are the many donations from David Abraham; Peter Watt, Labour's Secretary General (and their former head of performance) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown is going to be on his way back.
However, governments can reach a turning point that makes them feel impossible to govern.
Neither can people trust nor politicians, but they usually hold back their scepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister will improve the situation, and it does not even need to be there for a long time, this delay is over: the public service is beginning to become disquiet; the Cabinet ministers are beginning to chat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and ungodly.
In a way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he'd like to deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax records, for example, are related to decisions made by Brown as Chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if he was not directly involved in Blair's misfortune - as in the long "money for nobility" investigation of political party financing - the voters may assume that he was.
Still, Brown's situation is not as bad as it looks
The sins are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, or was completely clouded.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown's naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new commitment to political donations is a good example.
The garboeske Abraham, who compares his donations with his non-profit gifts, says he does not wish public recognition for his good will.
That may be the case, but he was not allowed to make the decision.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he knew about Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, will obviously have to ask some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's main financial collector, who was told about the strange donations in October.
But so far, Brown is not involved: there is nothing that indicates that he knew about these confusion, although most of the payments were made after he took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he watered this determination through the grieving of a known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - in order to complete the measure, by a bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this case, the "lessons to be drawn from it" are not very complicated.
If the law is broken, it's a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Public Health Standards, which has been unoccupied for six months, and moving forward with a radical reform of political party financing.
This would require the hard-liners of the Labour to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly give up the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party-mate like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some party facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear leadership in the opinion polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can achieve a victory is through indisputable justice and solid competence.
Card Sharks
Is America's credit crisis on the credit card market?
When blood is in the water, it's only natural that back-fins are swirling excited.
Now that America's real estate market is in trouble, the predators are targeting the country's credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts expect that the credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the risk of underfunded credit spread to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both bookings and rates of interest, which measure the proportion of loans that are not recoverable or are too late for more than 30 days.
HSBC has announced last month that it has taken a $1.4 billion fee collection from its American consumer financing, partly because of the weakness of credit card customers.
It's still too early to panic.
Losses and saumings are still low.
According to the Moody rating agency, the third-quarter column rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the US private insolvency laws in 2005 led to an abrupt case of bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a large part of the credit card losses; the number of applications (and thus saumnis fees) would increase again, whether the general conditions for borrowers are deteriorating or not.
The industry also reports on solid payment rates that show how much of their debt consumers pay each month
and trust in credit card-based securities is rather strong, despite the standstill in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney from the TowerGroup, a research company, expects the expenditure for 2007 to be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: it is more likely that consumers are taking credit card debt, now that home credit is drying out.
However, the card exhibitors look at the cash flow instead of capital values, therefore falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the borrower's creditworthiness.
They can even be of benefit to the card exhibitors.
Incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates are reduced if the real estate is less than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt among the repayment priorities becomes more important.
Card exhibitors can also react much faster and more flexible than lenders to the more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of assets.
"We will not wake up one day and reassess the loans completely," says Gary Perlin, Capital Ore's main financial reference.
Even if a sudden understatement crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable downturn are much more real.
If lower house prices and a reduction in credit are to push America into the recession, industry will undoubtedly face a more grim future.
Keep looking for these shark fins.
British bankers confess guilty in the case of Enron
Three British bankers who were to be brought to justice for their role in the fraudulent system with the former Chief Financial Director of Enron, Andrew Fastow, turned their requests into guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded innocent for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications for the alleged conspiracy with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure had been initiated on January.
But during a hearing in court in front of U.S. district judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty in a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former managers of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK during extradition procedures, which lasted two years.
In the United States, their case is a loose end to an investigation launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The allegations originally filed against them in 2002 made Fastow aware that he was the aim of a government investigation into the Enron decline.
The charges against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claim that they came to Houston in 2000 to create a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top advisor Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron, which was controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent enron-making companies that helped to bring the company into bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank had estimated the value of its participation in the subsidiary to be zero, but the three British men knew that it actually had significant value.
A company under Kopper's control acquired the bank's shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid heads $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the charges, Fastow misrepresented Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received 7.3 million dollars, while Fastow, Kopper and others were beaming about 12.3 million dollars, according to the charges.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty in two charges of conspiracy for his role in the Enron's plea.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is in a six-year prison sentence in the federal prison of Louisiana.
Kopper has a three-year sentence and a month sentence in a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was free on the basis of a $1 million deposit that made it necessary for them to live in the United States in anticipation of the trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the nation, crumbled in bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks no longer could cover up the billions of debts or make weakening businesses appear profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
The Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the context of the Enron collapse.
Skilling has a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were annulled after he died last year because of heart disease.
Not at the bottom of Moscow
The price of an aircraft of the Gulfstream G550 brand, equipped with a Rolls Royce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles is at least 54 million dollars.
But this is change for some of the rich Russians.
"It can accommodate up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you are asking for so many seats because it's for a private family or a business president."
Firer was at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the millionaire exhibition, a four-day orgy of shown consumption, which was held in a masked exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers had built exhibition stands, hoping to be interested in anything new to money, from mahogany-filled yachts to diamond-covered car grills that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer carefully targeted a shiny orange Porsche at the next stand.
"This is a nice car, but it's change compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Heated by an oil tree, the Russian capital seems to be so flooded with money like Dallas at its glamorous times.
"We went through the same phase in the 180s, when some Americans came to huge wealth and went to Europe in a crowd where they were considered materialist," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi-Arab overflies of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are the most visible free-of-charge money exhibitors in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the gold exchange.
In other words, this week in Moscow, a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, has attracted to exchange ideas on how to sell high-price goods on markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organised by The International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billion, which have a total of 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires are part of the second class, which are worth $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts at the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a committee of experts here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8% of Russians lived below the minimum of existence.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweler.
She had visited the trade fair for the first time with the Russian dealer of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all well-kept and the men are all worth a fortune."
As they go through the halls on Sunday night, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, call themselves and their clients millionaires.
"I've been looking for the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she was wearing, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The trade fair seemed to be aimed primarily at the neural features, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be ready to stand in the traffic for several hours to visit a forward warehouse that was made up of a shameless Cadillac Escalades, pocket knives from platinum, Mövenpick ice cream, custom-made billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddybears.
The public could buy tickets for 30 Euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a stand of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt image of hand-painted, blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in climbers."
In fact, the traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-track logos to the type of sober brands with limited quantities that would not market themselves in a trade show.
However, several thousand people, whether millionaires, emissaries of millionaires or simply tourists, pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil's beds here said he sold two 70,000 dollar mattress sets made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn gold thread.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that issued high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said that his company sold the bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that adapts luxury cars to customer requirements, said that he had sold three car-cooling glasses for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which are similar to each other, for $55,000.
He showed a reporter a car tire that was developed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a rouletterad.
The cost: $22,000 for a four-replacement.
"The Russian millionaire, who wants to have a picture of his wife's face from Cuban zirconium, will not necessarily go on these wheels," said Mr Karapetian.
"He'll keep it in his 30 or 40-car garage."
Even though many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in local real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they're probably already millionaires, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you believe."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich in a stand operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four red phone cells according to the British model, which were full of mountains of false millions of dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his employees had printed 500,000 false banknotes for the millionaire trade fair.
Passers stopped to throw around the money heaps, mobile photos, while they were standing back in the middle of the spare, having friends cut, or just to put a few million in.
"Look, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr Karryev.
Packed operation suspected in the event of death in New Jersey
It was the day before the harvest thank you when Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurants here and watched an ambulance at the white Cape Cod holding two doors further down on West Scott Avenue.
Soon after, there was a police car there.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the medical coroner's truck coming," said Livingston, a supervisor of the restaurant on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone had died."
The authorities learned that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newarker police department.
Now the investigators are trying to find out if she died because of a procedure carried out by a non-authorised cosmetic surgeon who did not identify the police and who worked in the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet found out what caused Mrs Arroyo's death and are hopeful that toxicological studies, the results of which could not be available for weeks, will help to clear up a mysterious death that has sent a grief through the leadership of the Newark police.
Mrs Arroyo has been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard working and persistent," said Mr McCarthy about Mrs Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pitbull.
She protected me. "
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newarker police officer working for the alcohol control commission, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a speaker for the Union County Attorney, Theodore J. Romankov, said that investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of an unapproved surgical treatment.
"This is one of the possibilities," said Mrs Walsh.
"It is an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 in the afternoon in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have reported little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to say whether Mrs Castro was questioned by the authorities.
The investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs Castros' house, where a welcome rose shrub is in the narrow front garden and a Dalmatian barks behind the house.
A blue barrel marked with "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a replacement for vanilla in food and perfume - sat in the parking lot next to a door that led to the lower floor.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark, after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable value and helped him to find himself in the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said," You have to pay attention to this or that, "he said.
"She was always here when I got here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing. "
Prospects that the central bank will reduce interest rates will lead to an increase in world market shares
The shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm the credit markets by further interest-rate cuts, were strengthened by the Vice-President of the US Central Bank, with hesitant comments.
The stock markets increased in London, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the central bank president, said that the policy had to respond "flexible and pragmatic" to the continuing pressure on financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm down sad markets, given signs of emerging credit tensions, Kohn said that the recent turbulence had "partially reversed some of the improvements in the market functions of late September and October."
If the increased turbulence remained, it would increase the possibility of further tightening the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken up by investors as a signal that the Central Bank is ready to intervene and to stabilise the credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest rate reductions.
The statements also helped to calm Wall Street, given further bad news from the US economy, now that sales of US real estate reached a new record deep in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence were underlined by the announcement of Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that it would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its global employees, in a cost reduction measure to offset serious losses from its lost bets in the US mortgage credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these places in London will disappear, where the Bank employs 1,500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent to close at 13.289.40, while the wider S & P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent to close at 6.306.2, which added more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standard values.
Germany's index Dax increased by 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Before that, the reappearance of credit pressure on the markets had been underlined, following a strong demand for an auction of three-month guarantees from the European Central Bank, which was granted to the European Trade Banks, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow and to enter further capital into the money markets in London increased as the three-month "Libor" rates for lending between UK banks were seen to rise by 6.59% to their highest since late September, following a continuous increase since 21 November.
England faced with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the other.
Who's to hit as number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who is to make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the President-in-Office, on call at least under this special title, is here to help the head coach Peter Moors and the captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English managing director, is gradually filling with applications for national electoral offices, if not even for those in part-time.
Whoever does not get the sixth battle position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is undoubtedly.
It is never easy to close down exactly, which allows a person to reach the top of his profession, while someone else never goes beyond the lowest rank, sometimes because of lack of happiness instead of ability.
It is not only in the cricket where the selection is difficult, where judgments are needed, which are always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to rise?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same may also be asked in another area whether, for example, John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young managers with good qualifications, who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class for a cricket player is unless he is given the opportunity to swim or go down.
Of course, figures have a great influence on decisions, but there are also opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to catch the captain's eye at the right time if he can take a wicket and a bat has to get regular chances of order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricket player.
To catch the eyes of the chosen is more complicated.
There were many who were better in the last season than, for example, when James Anderson, who would appear to be playing in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and how the wind is torturing into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets each with 33 runs to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hope for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara is playing at the Asgiriya stage can only be a question of view.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood who was still fighting to consolidate himself at that time, who made the breakthrough into a major test cricket player and who, although he was punching a double hundred against Australia in Australia, might still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will follow their conservative instincts and gut sense for Shah's greater experience of Bopara's youth enthusiasm after a further discussion during today's network meeting at the Asgiriya Stadium.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 top-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is seven years younger at the age of 22, and an excellent balance against turned ball.
But Shah only made ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus his immediate rejection of the voters as Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the momentum out of his battle, which was still evident in Bombay.
On the other hand, the Alleskunner from Essex has a bit of a joy of life.
He is not impressed by anything on a cricket site and his attitude aside was brought to the point when he recently overlaid a four-wheel vehicle in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to take out his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and call his team mate Alastair Cook, who had observed this from a distance, and say with enthusiasm, "Did you see this?"
Bopara is a much better field player, he steals his middle rate with some effect here on the fields, which seems to fit him and beats with confidence and skill.
To choose the right man is one thing to choose the right time another.
Maybe that's the real art of choice.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which does not mean that Shah may not be well if, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he is the one who will play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Qaeda
The first bus shipments of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced persons whose money or visas have expired, and others who hoped that the city would return to normality.
Some had even come back to fight the rebels they had expelled from their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operating with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned to private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper about what happened in Baghdad and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people, "he said, with regard to the Shiite militias of the militant clerics Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to return at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the vast Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime does not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbours in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local US-supported militia helped to drive Al-Qaida out of their bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been expelled from his house in Sheikh in the north of Baghdad by an attack with hand grenades after he had called on his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaeda.
He had come back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started one of the anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sheikh and that they need my support and that of my boys.
This is why I returned today, "said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62nd
Many told them that they had been lured by the increasing peace in the capital since the US troops increase and the growth of local "groups of affected citizens," which were armed and in cooperation with the American military to defend their districts.
But more were talking about being forced home by visa problems and money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-time father, expressed the general suspicion among the exilants that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled from the sectarian death squadrons in the country.
"We went well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government urged the Iraqis not to give any more visas to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis have been distributed from Shiite residential areas and vice versa, leading to the creation of many places where tensions have been reduced.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will rekindle sectarian tensions and conflict will arise.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest country is the leading country in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
It is only in one field of education that the Saarland countries are in the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I have declared yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Saar country that we are not French" - this slogan is the smallest country that is self-styronically on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland, which is in place five in the education monitor of the Institute of the German Economy in Cologne (IW).
In this way, universities are already working closely with neighbouring countries from a tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple diploma.
The proportion of foreign students is therefore high at 15.6%.
But also the children of the country bring the Saarland to higher education in over-average numbers - many of them without a degree from the high school.
"In the Saarland, the vocational education system is used," says Axel Plünnecke, an educational expert at the IW.
More than one in five young people acquire their right to study at a vocational school, which means that the Saarland is more than seven percentage points higher than the German average.
The combination of vocational and academic training has also been considerably increased.
According to the population, the equipment with dual study programmes is the second best in Germany.
However, despite the practice of training and increasing demand, the number of engineers has fallen by one third in recent years.
This is why the Ministry of Education of the country has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"After the first Pisa study, we started a number of reforms at the general education schools," says a speaker from the Ministry of Education.
For example, the government introduced national comparative tests.
The last Kita year is free of charge for the children to start learning earlier - a model that is now also copying other federal states.
It is only in the future that future comparative studies will show whether the performance of the students is improving in a sustainable way.
In Pisa 2003, the proportion of risk students fell from 29 to 20%.
In total, however, the Saarland did not increase as much as other federal states.
The Bavaria are better off.
And to the detriment of the Saarland countries, foreign language knowledge at Pisa is not measured - in this area one could otherwise point out.
The language of the neighbours is compulsory in high schools - even if the Saarland are not French.
Chávez is changing the watches
In Venezuela, the watches will soon be ticking differently from the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez will have the time-meters turned back in the South American country by half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a joke.
According to a new law, as the Official Journal of Venezuela said, the world-time watches are set minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
The US enemy Chávez justified his decision, inter alia, by the fact that the United States of the world had imposed the division into time zones at full hours.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time), Chávez announced the termination of relations with the neighbouring country of Colombia due to a hostage affair.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe President of Colombia remains, he will not have relations with the head of state or with the Colombian government.
"I cannot do this alone because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is driving a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil country must vote on on on Sunday in a referendum.
With the reform, it would significantly increase its power in the country.
The result of the dispute was the decision of Uribes to remove Chávez from the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, which concerned the release of hostages.
Uribe had "spit in the face" Venezuela with his decision, had criticised Chávez on Sunday.
In Spain, too, Chávez is in the mouth.
A new mobile phone ringtone provides furore in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you keep your mouth shut) is the set that has already downloaded more than half a million people from the Internet.
He was spoken by the Spanish king Juan Carlos, who had been raised at the recent Iroamerican summit by the constant interludes of the Left Spopulist and had overtaken it.
Germany is at risk of wage less in 2007
Despite the strong economic situation, German workers are forecast to lose real wages this year.
Experts called a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler-Stiftung, employees could expect in real terms to be less on the pay account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"This is due to the modest wage development, the increase in VAT and the price of food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute of Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the "Bild" newspaper.
A new burden could also be imposed on workers in the case of unemployment insurance.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück said the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent of the change in the year was correct and reasonable in the present situation.
However, if the Federal Agency for Labour should not be embarrassed to have to ask for loans or grants from the federal government, the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday it was announced that the price explosion in food and oil products has driven the inflation rate to the highest level for 13 years.
Prices increased by 3.0 percent in the year as a whole.
Venus is the hellish twin of the earth
In spite of its life-hostile atmosphere, Venus is more similar than it has been thought to have been: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind waves on the Poles, as they also occur on the earth in winter.
For almost three decades, scientists have been expecting it to flash on Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has demonstrated - it has detected electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: the lightning on Venus shoot at a height of about 56 kilometres from cloud to cloud, Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature."
According to the famous "Ursouppen theory," lightning has caused life on earth: thunderstorms are said to have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there was ever life there, it must have been in the very early history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there may be little living on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times closer than on Earth, sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the devil's twin of the earth, but it is a twin," said Russel.
Why the Venus, which is so similar to the Earth in mass and size, has made such a completely different development, is the fundamental question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, as no probe has been on the way to research this planet since the early 1990s.
The researchers believe that the latest research results, now presented in several "Nature" articles, do not only underline the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the similarities of our neighbouring planet with the earth are greater than initially assumed," the Esa reports.
In addition to the already known whirlwind on the North Pole, the researchers also found a skyscraper on the South Pole, which is turning much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air flows on the earthly winter hemisphere, a research team around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaciale e fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is almost as large with a diameter of 12.100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening stars, is circling the sun in just under 225 days.
But it is much slower around itself: a Venuday takes 243 Earth days.
Although Venus with a surface temperature of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar hardly reminds us of the Earth, scientists assume that both planets have been created under very similar conditions.
On both of them water gathered, which remained on earth in oceans, but on which Venus was lost in space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on Earth in carbon stones, it makes up the majority of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler calls for an end to the party dispute for the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticised the SPD for its attacks on the Chancellor after the September meeting.
President Horst Köhler is concerned about the reputation of Germany and has asked the great coalition to end the dispute about the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a split nation to the outside world on this issue," said Köhler to the trade sheet.
At the same time, Köhler signalled his understanding of the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I respect the diversity of cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but took Merkel in protection from the accusation that it was pursuing a new China policy.
"The Chancellor has not taken away from the traditional one-China policy.
China also knows that, "said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed dissatisfaction at the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from the Union's ranks.
Steinmeier had, among other things, complained about the Union's "shop window policy" in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lamas in the Chancellery, there was severe irritation in the German-Chinese relationship.
For example, the Chinese leadership not only unloaded the German finance minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to the information of the SPIEGEL, also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministers of both countries.
China's head of state Wen Jiabao has now asked Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
China rejects the official reception of the religious leader of the Tibetans by European politicians, Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The Dalai Lamas' actions and words showed that he was trying to split Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other provinces today, from China.
Schäuble warns against the claw like in France
Road battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like in France.
It was necessary to do everything possible to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany did not get rid of itself by force on the road, the Federal Minister of the Interior asked.
Barricades burned, Randalierer shot at the police with shotguns: After the heavy youth cramps in France, Federal Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We must ensure that social explosives do not build up and discharge themselves in violence.
We have to take this seriously, "he said the" New Press "in Hanover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change in social reality.
The federal government, countries and municipalities have been working hard to reduce problems, said Schäuble.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islamic Conference, this already shows first successes."
However, it was too early for a warning.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that there were no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had been carrying out heavy street battles with the police in the past nights.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings also burned.
However, the President of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater integration efforts by the Federal Government.
In view of the riots in France, Colat warned against "imitation effects."
The situation in Germany is not as brilliant as in France.
However, there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate for young people with a migration background under 25 years of age was "above average."
In particular, more training places should be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We must give young people a perspective."
However, the chairman of the Turkish community added that in Germany more than in France "social control in the families takes place."
Moreover, many young people with a migrant background did not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat said, "But we still have to be careful."
It was necessary to "give young people the opportunity to participate in work and training."
Meanwhile, it remained largely quiet at night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of the police were in use, a helicopter flew over the area with headlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning bins and cars.
Since the day before, a supply of about 1000 security forces has provided rest.
The police will go through as long as it takes, Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburbs.
The night on Tuesday, around 80 police officers were injured at Krawalallen in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the following night, the unrest took over on Toulouse.
The Kraalle was ignited by a traffic accident in which two young people were killed on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the death of the young.
In the realm of Angela Wolke
The Chancellor's far-off appearance of reality documents that the coalition is at the end of the matter - and that there is nothing to be expected of her.
What country does this Chancellor live in?
After her uncomforting appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was extremely and low in content, one must say: not here - not in the country that it would have to rule at last.
The accusation that it is too focused on foreign policy has been rejected by Angela Merkel with a very inexcusable sentence.
That was provincial, she said, and only showed that she did not want to understand what the critics are about.
In the Bundestag, it has clearly documented to everyone how much their accusation is.
There was neither a specific interest nor a sense of the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented himself: a defiant politician who is fleeing into foreign policy and who remains in the dark even there.
For example, climate protection: it commends itself on the decisions of Heiligendamm, but does not say how to achieve the climate objectives in this country.
In fact, the self-praise - that much immodesty the CDU chief would have failed two years ago.
Now she is clinging to the foss that the upturn is coming to people.
This will damage her image as a pragmatist who solves problems rather than speak the world beautifully.
But in the realm of Angela Cloud, domestic political problems are a turning point.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-earners?
She's got a few side-effects for that.
It is important to note how often it promises itself when it comes to the child supplement.
It takes three steps to get Merkel a half-straight set out.
It stumbles on a foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Attack Division
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney have a hard fight exchange - and now they have to fear an outside candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already getting off on the first subject.
He has made New York a "place of refuge for illegal immigrants," and Mitt Romney is proclaiming his counterpart Rudy Giuliani.
This, on the one hand, is in the face of serious allegations: "I would say that his own house was a port for illegal," said Giuliani, and accused the former governor of Massachusetts of having employed private immigrants without papers.
The candidates are blowing to the attack: Because the Republican base still has no clear favorites, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN in particular to discredit their opponents.
The self-turned 30-second videos that Internet users have sent in via YouTube are hardly more than keywords.
"With this kind of isolationism, we have brought Hitler to power," John McCain proclaims to his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also strongly read by the Vietnam veterans when he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding," a method of interrogation in which drowning is simulated as torture.
However, the fact that the important issues of the campaign are now beyond Iraq's war and torture debates shows the reactions of the Saal audience in St. Petersburg in Floridas.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, applause in the auditorium opens up.
This shows once again where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," explains Romney, who is displeased with the fact that he was still one of the abbot's supporters in 1994 before the base and the TV audience.
On the other hand, Giuliani comes into the loop when he is asked to interpret the Bible in a literal way.
Musharraf is the first to rule in civilian
One day after his resignation as chief of the army, the Pakistani leader Musharraf was sworn president.
This is how eight years of military rule end in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn on Thursday for another five-year term.
The Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony in the presidential palace of the capital of Islamabad live.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the benefit of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his office as army chief to his trusted Ashfaq Kiyani and thus bent on international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after he took power in an unblooded military coup, the former general now governs as the civilian head of state for the first time.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is an end to the state of emergency that Musharraf had imposed on 3 November.
Soon after his insulting, Musharraf will, according to General Prosecutor Malik Muhammad Qayyum, lift the state of emergency and thus meet another demand from the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied with him after the imposition of the state of emergency in early November, had rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan, five soldiers were killed and four more were injured in an attack on a military convoy.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of the Krautrock return
Germany's supergroup of the seventies is again playing: the three band members of Harmonia took their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
For the Revival a piece of her great time "Live 1974" appears.
Even then they were much more famous abroad.
The infamous sensation then takes place in the form of three right men at the evening table.
Everyone has their box ahead, their cables, and above all their buttons.
Dieter Moebius is in the flower-white shirt at 63 years in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years old and owned by laptop and guitar.
On the right, from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, focuses on the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds to a traditional piece of music.
The gentlemen themselves do not seem to be very disturbed by this.
That the band is playing harmonia again has caused some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
In this context, it is important to reveal: Targeted questions have shown that, although the name was swirling through collective poop memory, it was not so sustainable to miss this band for 32 years.
But why should the German also be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the seventies?
In particular, since what is called misleading Krautrock, in England and America, was always more than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize for Life Work to the survivors of the Cologne group Can in 2003, it was seen in the room in asking German poopslauchter.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and New! in the Laudatio, the surprise knew no limits.
At concerts, Michael Rother later hosted the Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage as an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and the transfiguration in the stranger is one.
The memory is already overwhelmed with harmonia because the trio existed only for two years and in that time also had a much lower power of action than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously performed with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
First, they played in the basement under the Berlin Schaubühne.
After that in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the Church.
Rother had briefly helped out at the power station and then played a reputation as a guitarist at Neu!, the perhaps most radical German group at that time.
In 1973, Rother followed the cluster musicians to exile to Forst in the Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruins of the 16th century, they lived as city-fleeting communards.
Less ideological than in the Commune I, where Roedelius was allowed to plunder himself as a nanny.
More like being a great artist.
It is said that in the "Schirrmüll" there was also a wimp of the singing association Harmonia Ottenstein and a name for art.
Some of them held on to Harmony.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the next "De Luxe."
Because so late and modest the music also sounded, the band suffered material need.
The collection of rice was not just for self-discovery.
The CD "Live 1974" was now released at a concert in Griessem, in front of an almost 50-head record setting, as someone thinks they can remember.
From Rother there came the desire to force harmonia and to practice it occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius a disgraceful demand.
= = References = = = = External links = =
Rother landed in the esoteric-spherical and secured his existence with albums like "Flaming hearts."
Cluster was revived in the eighties and has been more successful since then than it has ever been Harmonia.
The Greek live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record company Greenland has set itself the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as its own German contribution to living music.
New! was already excavated like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Public subsidies, within the framework of the festival Woldronics.
Julian Cope is here, the British, Altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler."
There is also the Loveparade inventor Dr. Motte.
Which would outline the entire range of the influences of the Krautrock on the following pop music.
The space of the supergroup is filled by Harmonia.
The phrase by Brian Eno is floating with the most extraordinary sounds in the room: "The only true music, it belongs to the future."
There are pictures that show the producers with harmonia in the farmhouse.
The formation of legends is used for projections of other black and white-and-white photographs of wire-wired devices.
Before that, the three veterans are again engaged in improvisation.
No more by sticking microphones to the organ and to the drums to unravel the instruments through self-built effect devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in the technical tüftler.
The choir of the house doesn't change that either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgensterns is coughing and frowned under sound clouds and sang in a beautiful place with the "Aaaaaaaah!" stage.
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never about rock.
The roots were less sought in the blues than in music schools (can), technologies (power plant) or on the run from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
He who calls here "'68!" is not quite wrong, and Harmony cannot be brought out of this right now.
The most self-evident is also thoroughly reconsidered on the stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can give you great luck to rob your nerves or escape moments.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Murderous Peace," two films again deal with the Balkan War.
But both of them don't convince.
Either the concepts rely too much on action and banners, or they are too stirring.
Richard Gere can't help in "The Hunting Party."
The good news first: while the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnia war, the actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had last lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because too many nice and uninterested roles in well-being films for women and too many press conferences on Buddhism have led you to feel the desire to have a look at it.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party - If the hunter becomes a hunted man" (Why do film titles have to be as long and confused as locator collective agreements today?)?
He provides a wonderful eye-binding representation: In fact, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have been made of gore if fate and the film industry were not so gratifying: a man who has long been behind his very best times, but who, as a ruins-like monument of his decline, has still preserved considerable remains of the former charm.
But in spite of this, "The Hunting Party" continues with the German production "Murderischer Peace," which also starts this week, only the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serbin from the Kosovan rear-guards, which one of them is also in love with them.
Although it is welcome that once the Serbs are not represented as the sole root of all the evil, the television-flat film is too quickly lost in banners and action.
It remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but with war for it.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" is an example of why there has never been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three US war reporters, who are opening up to track down the Serbian top-war criminal "the fox," could have become a new Apocalypse Now with another director and another screenwriter (both in Human Union Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the stories are very similar: both small teams go into the forest to do something that the military can't do and both times it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the cynical who came down with his heart when he was introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script has to add a romantic affair to him with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down the stream if the reporters within the last five minutes in the time-lapse process succeed in what Nato, CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have not managed in five years: catch the war criminal and leave the Muslim Bosnians to just revenge.
This is so bad that you want to call the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against kinology.
The film has a deep human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still on the loose, and he suspects the Americans and the French (they are supposed to agree on this for the time being) not to be too intense to pursue the persecution on the basis of secret political agreements.
But the good mean and the evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the work table of the poet: "I can see the swollen nostrils, pointing out how hard it is to be evil."
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly those threshold heads, but they indicate how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan War film.
Recently, in this newspaper, it was reported that all of the Iraq movies were Hollywood's big flops.
One can add: There has never been a good South Africa film.
It's almost always true that if a star is driving around the world's crisis herds or minefields, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "beyond all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "blood diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio will come out.
Perhaps all the conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, decades had to pass before Hollywood was able to make a good film about the Holocaust with "Schindler's list."
Some of the film will probably still be mature - the Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter," "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" now in a classic state were not celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But maybe today we know where every mass murder in real time comes home on two screens, even too much about the conflicts in the world.
And that's what robbers the screenwriters of the unthinking that it takes to tell good stories.
After all, "being or not" or "The great dictator" has become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you can't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Maybe you have to have the sarcastically distant artist's view of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was asked about parallels between his historical novel "Lemprières Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he said: "This is only because some things never change.
Large cities will always be extremely dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and war will always prevail in Yugoslavia. "
von Beust is harvesting criticism for Olympic rejection
The departure of the mayor from the Hamburgs application for the Summer Olympics has been a major criticism of politics and the economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the games on the water.
But by Beust, realism in the assessment of the opportunities is a warning.
The main executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, called a "not good for the economic location" on Wednesday.
No other project has recently developed as great motivation forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this objective, the momentum of sport policy could not be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to "that is based on a changed timeline."
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday with previous statements that the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic at least by 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said von Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation to apply for Munich for the 2018 Winter Games.
"This preference means that we will not have any realistic opportunities in the period we have planned until 2028."
However, the dream was not dreamt for all time, said of Bust.
The Hamburg Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This gives the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to take a chance to bury the plans at that time," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application is also in conflict with the statement of the Head of Senate on the occasion of a reception to the General Assembly of the German University Sports Association.
There, von Beust had called the application of Hamburg for the Universiade 2015 "not as a replacement" for the Hamburg Olympic Games.
The University Sports Association had only nominated Hamburg as a candidate city last week.
The SPD civil society group accused the Senate of not having used valuable time for housing construction in Hamburg.
"The development of the little Grasbrook has been delayed for years by the Senate because it has put on the map Olympia and has excluded housing," said the SPD Members Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always called for integrated planning for the little Grasbrook for Olympia and later home use, the CDU has put one-sided on the "event factor."
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics had at the time brought great enthusiasm to Hamburg.
Hamburg had failed, however, to Leipzig.
It's not Warhol's box.
Those who connect the terms Sweden and the wooden box think of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At present, wood boxes made in Sweden are throwing dark shadows on Warhol's work directory.
A large part of the ninety-four Brillo boxes of the "type Stockholm" listed there are forgeries.
After a few months ago, the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes in 1968, internal research in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now comes to an alarming result: the six "Brillo-Boxes," which the former museum director Pontus Hultén gave to the Moderna Museet in 1995, are copies - and probably most of the around a hundred more Brillo boxes of the "type Stockholm" that are in the international art market.
The history of the past is encapsulated, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes," painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard cartons of the soap powder "Brillo."
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet 1968 - with Warhol's consent - exhibited hundreds of cardboard glasses: these were not from Warhol (for cost reasons), but were delivered directly from the Brillo-Carton factory.
It was not works of art, it was their examples, just exhibits.
At the same time, in 1968, Warhol had given permission to produce a few Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, but they were not issued in the Moderna Museet.
Time witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes that were then authorized as original Andy Warhol Brillo boxes called "type Stockholm" rightly entered into the art and auction history.
Some of them have made more than $100 000 on auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén has later falsely claimed that it was produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were only produced in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time, Warhol was dead for three years.
Lars Bystrom, head conservatory at the Moderna Museet, has also examined three of Swedish private property, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their press panels were first ground and milled, and then white oil color was applied with a brush.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, tells us that the colour was applied directly to the press panel with a paint roll without foundation - it is also not oil, but acrylic.
"These boxes were not authorised by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes," says the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve, "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in his collection as copies / exhibition material."
However, in July the Authentication Board announced that it would follow up the "serious accusations" that are being made in the case of the soap powder boxes.
But since then, you have been there in unbeatable silence.
Rebellion soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebellious soldiers have abandoned, who are in a hotel in Manila, and had called for the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not be responsible for bloodshed, said the leader Antonio Trilanes, who accused the President of corruption and electoral fraud, reporters in the hotel.
Government-conscious soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been in the building for hours.
About half of them were in court on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trilanes.
He used the trial to suddenly deal with about 30 sympathizers.
The military policemen, who were supposed to guard him, had apparently passed over to him and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Local government forces were blocking the district around the hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Council.
The National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
"People have enough," said Trilanes.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who used to command the Scout Rangers' elite unit, said other army units wanted to join the march soon.
Government critics had called for large demonstrations against the President for Friday.
Your government has been overshadowed by allegations of corruption for months.
Manila's financial district was already the main scene of the attempted mutiny of about 200 military members against Arroyo in 2003.
The uprising failed after just under 24 hours in the refusal of the army to join.
Since 1986, at least seven coup attempts have been made against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
