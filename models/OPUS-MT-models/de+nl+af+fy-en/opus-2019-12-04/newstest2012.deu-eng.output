No liberating amendment for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament today refused to accept the request to abolish the paragraphs on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been condemned as part of a revision of the Criminal Code.
The new regulation, which could have paved the way for the release of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, was rejected by the Members at the second reading of the request for the reduction of the penalties for economic offences.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the conclusion of a supposedly negative contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet in force, and in December the appeal of the convicted is to be negotiated in court.
Tymoshenko himself denies the judgment as a political revenge of the regime and in the West the trial caused the suspicion of the court's premonition.
The request to remove paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was sentenced to leave the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 Members.
226 votes would have been necessary for it to be adopted.
Libya's victory
The history of the Libyan Liberation Campaign or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As it is common in this region, Islamists win in the elections, the question is only which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council was aware of the right of habit of the Scharīʿa, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would become a country without a crime, because for theft you will soon cut off your hand.
Women should also forget about emancipation as soon as possible, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society will be united by the Koran from each other's command tribes in the future.
In short - in Libya there will be an order that would hardly be imaginable and, above all, would not be desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objective one, it is not the best one, and it would hardly fit the above-mentioned Libyans.
In this way, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters could be helped by the unbelieving dogs at all.
The only reason for their apology is that NATO's air attacks were not led by any general from America, but by God himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We only took part in a change of shot, served the interests of Islam and our politicians got rid of themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to refrain from a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the Hiesigen are a concern - the expulsion of the crusaders.
But do the oil companies get the black gold at the spot price even without an occution?
The West can, at last, with the right of its self-determination in the protection of human rights.
If this does not destroy the Scharīʿa representatives.
The start of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm took place through Europe.
The Member States published their data on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, Germany and France.
The bond market today, however, is tearing up all records.
Investors not only keep an eye on Greece, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European zone, Germany, Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is expected to grow by 0.5%, which is 0.4% of France.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter in which Germany had a higher growth than originally expected (growth of 0.3% instead of forecast 0.1%), while France had a slight fall of 0.1% (initial data were only about stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in this third quarter compared to the previous year.
In comparison to the previous quarter, however, gross domestic product stagnated and according to Tsch. The trend in the growth slowdown in economic performance was confirmed.
The results are therefore worse than the analysts' forecasts.
The most important events are:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in this third quarter compared to the previous year, but stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonal data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
In the euro area as a whole and in the EU, the economy grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with the expectations of the analysts.
The Greek economy decreased by 5.2% compared to the previous year.
The return on its 10-year government bonds was 28.45%.
The return on Italian and Spanish government bonds increased to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also starting to feel problems...
The return on Czech government bonds is below 4%, even if the situation in the region is deteriorating.
In Germany, voices are made out that the ECB should become the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1: 0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has been the hardest task of the whole season!
She won 1: 0 in Montenegro, thanks to a well-laid-up goalkeeper Čech and a beautiful gate by Petr Jiráček.
With a large portion of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious lead from home play and will not once again be missing at the European Championship.
IHNEd.cz followed up the ascent game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech selection also won 1: 0 with the final weakness of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro, and has thus redeemed their ticket for the football EM.
Also because of the precise defence game of the Czech team, they were able to put more pressure on Montenegro in the second half of the year.
The game's bad luck birds were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two big chances.
Thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will be part of the European Championships next year, and it is also a pleasure to see that there is a premium of about 200 million for domestic football.
From the first minutes, quite a fighting football was played.
Both teams were long in combination and so was played mainly around the middle line.
In the second half of the year, the pressure of the home government remained and the large cuts in front of the criminal space were successfully rejected by the Czech defence.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's core program.
They made a living sign.
Some hundreds of university students formed a living sign around a nuclear object in Iran.
With this gesture they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country's core programme before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed before the object on Tuesday afternoon and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students from the University of Iran in Isfahan formed a living sign on Tuesday around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is processed.
They wanted to know that they were ready to protect their country's core programme, if necessary with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran seems to have not given up on its efforts to create a nuclear weapon.
Israel is also talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear installations.
Students had prayed at noon before the entrance to the complex and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
According to the Israeli press, in the case of an attack on the Iranian nuclear programme, the nuclear enrichment plant in Natan's attack target would also be from the centre of Isfahan.
The menu of a greasy child: it does not breakfast and eats to the evening bread sausage
More than one third of children from 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with 9% of all pupils and 5% of all children overweight.
Current surveys have been shown - adipous children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows once again how important it is for the healthy development of a person the environment in which he grows up and are the examples that surround him.
On the tables of adipous children there are up to half more sausages on the table than in families where children are normally important.
More than 19 percent of the overweight children had the theme of "Adipositas is no coincidence" to the evening bread on the day before the education action.
In families with thicknesses, sport is not exactly one of the favorite jobs, but also the majority of today's students - only 15% answered that their parents find themselves at least once a week for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place in the past year towards the end of the school year, with nearly 900 children from primary schools being interviewed throughout the Czech Republic.
This was already the second year of the action "Adipositas is not a coincidence," which is supported by the General Health Insurance Fund and the company Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4 and 8 classes have participated in the project.
Unhealthy costs and lack of movement in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the alarming increase in the number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of the children interviewed, for example, led five times a day to eat breakfast-second breakfast-lunch-vesper-evening bread in the mode - one of the main conditions for a healthy diet," is one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage to the evening bread
Experts point out that relative little things, such as the regular breakfast time of the family, are also important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of the students' families have breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone has breakfast for themselves.
The worst thing was the fact that every tenth family is not at all to have breakfast.
Breakfast is considered the basis of healthy daily food.
The survey test showed, among other things, that the families of overweight children often use unhealthy fries.
And almost everyone - without regard for weight - drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40% of the children surveyed are in sport, only less than half of their parents do so - only 15%.
Put your own menu together
Another part of the survey made it possible for selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to make up their own dining plan from opportunities offered in accordance with appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children prefer between 12 and 15 in terms of diet is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite meals were many meal, meat dishes and, of course, sweet food.
"Alarmating is above all the great popularity of sweet lemonades," is highlighted in the final report on this survey.
At lunch, that is, the main court, the pasta was won just before poultry.
The children did not like legumes at all, and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
Returning to health
At the same time, the survey also showed that the children are quite prepared to change their eating habits when they get proper information.
"The survey group, which completed the questionnaire after the end of the discussion" obesity is not a coincidence, "has in many cases seen a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition," is the result of the project.
This was obvious, for example, in the sweet Limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
In the questionnaire, the children also identified much more often poultry or fish as the main dish of the day and were prepared to eat less knots or sweet food.
Proclaim professionals - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how to learn stylists, I had a little bit masked that that was a little too much substance for the beginning.
I didn't even know what was coming.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how the "on the square" is going.
It's supposed to be worse.
The closer the test is, the more information and practical tasks we are facing.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully occupied.
This time we discussed with Director Alena (not a single man takes part in the course) how to attract a woman who does not have an ideal proportional figure.
And these are most of us, after all.
Some have too short a neck, others have too young a figure without proper curves and others are chubby.
It is up to the stylist to visually casher wide shoulders, to extend the neck or to spell out the necessary curves.
We also received tips on how to attract a woman type like Jennifer Lopez - with large bosses, wide hip and narrow waist - without being too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so big that the skirt or pants really don't fit, at least one should be cut to measure.
I'm sure you won't regret that, because well-sitting clothes are just priceless.
In such a tailor-made skirt you feel much better than in one of the bars, which is always too high and slippery, in the waist, etc.
Young figures can in turn be allowed to wear clothes with wrinkles, trees, applications, embroidery or rafting.
With this amount of information and figure types, I'm glad I have a whole week to let everything go through my mind.
And yet I'm afraid it's almost impossible to do it in the face of the house's record.
Each of the course participants was assigned a celebrity, for which she should make up suitable outfits - day clothes and evening grapes.
In doing so, we should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to "put Miranda Kerr" on, which you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
In the interior I'm cheering, because this is a lot better for me personally than to attract Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has in recent times probably increased to a hundred kilos (well, that's a little too much), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We are supposed to cut out the clothes from magazines or search, print out on the Internet and then edit them graphically.
The "Moodboard," as the whole result is called, is then to express our very personal style and our relationship to the graphic design.
It is very important to think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models physically, but also forms the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific requirements, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But it's not until Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall view.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information on the types of figures, was just the same as three visitors from the industry:
of the stylist Jan Pokorný, of the fashion creator Jakub Polanka and of the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to exploit it.
And a single stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in quite different ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat over the jeans as usual, so like a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, put your shoes on and wear it as a dress.
It's enough to clamp up the sleeves or the collar and the whole look looks quite different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But most of all, the following advice came to me: "First you must know the rules perfectly."
"Only then can you hurt her," said Jakub.
At last, I realize why we have to pause all these courses, what can be combined with something and why, even if you often get to see different things in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing variants than he finally photographed.
So for a fashion story with ten pages (i.e. ten outfits) you have to be prepared to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing in the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
So you have to count on all this in the design of the outfits.
That image and style sometimes make up half the success, that also confirmed to us Jan Pokorný.
All you need to do is look at Madonna, a not exactly brilliant singer from which image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are rather reserved.
Also well-known personalities often think this is out of the question (the main thing is that I bring something as I look at it is secondary).
And if one of us is to be styled, then we should expect that he or she will most likely impose a very different (smaller) size on us than he or she really needs.
Then you only need to google to see for sure that the boulevardpress writes that the corresponding celebrity has again increased or decreased, etc.
Jan and Mario put our hearts on Sunday, not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then the outfit "assemble."
In his work, he has to communicate with the people he's styling and he has to be a well-known psychologist.
I would like to make it clear to the Commission that it is not in the interests of the Member States.
"If any manager orders us to see her wardrobe and to add some pretty pieces, then we can't clean up the whole closet and say - my God, that's terrible."
"You have to find at least a few commendable things to recommend what you can carry," says Mario.
He also showed us in very concrete terms what such a so-called "space bag" must include.
So one of those bags that you put on the waist and in which you carry all the necessary prophecies.
In addition to such clear things, such as scissors, rollers to remove hair or safety needles, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (this helps the stylist to photograph products such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothes are rigged in the back, if it is too large (buttons or other clamps are forbidden, so that the fabric does not break down) and of course sewing equipment.
But in order not only to listen, but also to try something practical, we learned how to stick shoes properly.
Also when photographing in the studio, where the floor is just, you can damage the sole of the shoe, let alone the outside.
We were glued and glued to our o...
You can't even touch the shoes with the scissors, so you can't damage them.
So you really have to be smart.
Mario pleased me by commenting my "creation" without restrictions.
The above-mentioned skill is not exactly my strength.
All of this was just the fraction of what we heard at the second weekend continuation course.
I have now become aware of one thing - to devote myself to the styling at a professional level is not a child's play.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The original careless journey is made by a series of completely avoidable, dilttantian errors for routine travel to the early shift.
Although it was possible to fulfil the ambitions to a large extent, what is the point of doing this if obviously no one wanted to do a little more.
Even before he came to the shop tables, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" aroused high expectations.
He promised to move the game series "Need for Speed" back to a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he did not seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about how the fit passages in which the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues on foot.
But as you are already used to at NFS, in the end, much is different from what you expected.
Sure - it is potentially quite decent arcade races, but overall the game is reduced by some unnecessary errors that have been present in this series for more or less years.
So it is no longer a mistake, but rather a sign of a, in principle, unintelligible sincerity of the game developers.
The adventure begins very well.
For the first time, one is introduced into history, whose main character Jack has certain problems of personal character; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, you sit on the steering wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea contains a whole range of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is carried out on a different route and that the individual stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
You don't have the impression that game would always offer the same thing.
Some environments are still very nice to see, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the previous parts of the series.
So nothing world-moving.
But the journey through the desert, through autumn landscape or high up through deep snowy landscape is very pleasant visually.
Every now and then, untypical elements bring a little variety into the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that severely restricts the view.
In the mountains, in turn, you have to be very careful not to be spilled by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are installed quite well in a row.
Just a few, but they're enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to pick up (classic race against the stop clock), then you expect another personal duel with a single opponent.
And that's what the police want to mess up the whole thing.
One new thing is passages where Jack leaves the car.
This is more about certain interactive animations where Jack is fleeing from someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right time.
So nothing complicated.
It is, however, surprising that there are much less such passages in the game than one would expect (in concrete terms only three).
In the end, this is more to the advantage, because this element has at least no chance of getting boring - it is in the context of the above mentioned elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model is on the feet of the previous parts.
This means, from a current point of view, that it does not tear out trees, on the other hand, it could not be said that it is bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you have to look elsewhere.
But the local driving model is still well suited to an action-loaded race, even though it is possible to find better in the competition.
Until then, everything is in order.
Real problems only show up after some time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not entirely O.K.
There is little to expect from a game of this kind that it will calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you don't have any idea how the car is doing in the past, it's obviously not all right.
Typical example: When you overtake or get in front of the car you "strip" the other car in some places only easily, but in other, almost identical situation you get into the loop and turn wild pirouettes.
Or the car is about to go to scrap.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't matter any more, it's all annoying.
The restarts are so solved: if you have total damage or land far away from the track, then you throw the game back to the last point of reference of the track.
Only - in every race you only have five restarts.
When they're exhausted, everything goes from the front.
So the restarts are more of a tool, in case something doesn't succeed, but you don't want to rely on it.
Sometimes, however, the reboot does not even help, there is nothing other than to learn the critical section from the head.
Extremely unpleasant is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves, for example, have to be carried through in a very specific way, otherwise you just don't fit through.
Otherwise, you always meet "civilian" cars at the appropriate place in the same configuration, whether you are the first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations when you see that the opponent comes by before a playing two coming cars, but until you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive around or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, because everything is designed so that this situation always comes close to your nose.
The competitors have other advantages.
In the whole game there are a few places where you are always overtaken by the same opponent in the same place and again here without regard to the time.
This is the most crazy thing to do at the end of the game on the long bridge that happens in the opposite direction.
The adversary has to get you out of here, obviously.
And if he's already in front of you, he'll take a look at you, so you can start driving your own car in a few times.
Of course - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clear that it quickly saves you the joy of the game.
And that is a pity, because despite a simpler driving model, the game is generally quite entertaining and sometimes also so active that you almost don't know where the head is.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what "fault" is - the concept of fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no boredom can arise, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is also the change of car in the course of the races.
You must not miss the gas stations on the line, because here you can change the car, although in most cases the car you have is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight motorways and exotic super-sports cars for the technical trips, for example on the serpentine in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game history also goes the task mode (challenges) - that is, the races in the individual locations that you know from history.
There are not only medals here, but also points of experience for their own profile, which is common for the tasks (challenges) and history.
To get to the higher driver level, different items must be opened up: from the car to the background for the profile.
This is connected to the online function Autolog, which, among other things, compares its own results with those of other players and also ensures further collective functions.
One of another incomprehensible carvings is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you get to a subway tunnel (because of me) by car, where you ride on the tracks in the dark (because of me).
On the Tacho see numbers between 150 and 200 km / h (for my part), but there comes a subway from the back and a uncompromising road to scrap.
In our editorial work, we are going to argue for a long time about whether this was a blackout of the players or whether the authors think we're so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is in most cases quite appealing and even brilliant here and there.
It is all the more annoying that at some exciting moments the frequency of the image is getting slower and sometimes rather dramatic.
This, however, concerns, in particular, accidents involving a greater number of persons, where a continuous FPS does not benefit you anyway.
The sound is so far O.K. and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
A soundtrack a lá "of everyone" was created in an effort to address a wide scale as only possible, but who is buying such a game because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are more mixed.
If the game were not undermined by the absolutely unnecessary errors mentioned above, we could have claimed with the chest tone that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's kind of how the game works.
A great pleasure in itself, but one should be prepared to see these mistakes stabbing into your eyes with the power of airport headlights.
Concert of the "students of the velvet revolution" with singing ensembles of the Charles University
The Festival Festa Academica has already been offering for the third time the entertainment of the World Student Day with the anniversary of the Samten Revolution and this with the experience of music.
In the course of the festival, the 20 specialist and university choruses are presented.
The festival's focus is on the two concerts that will take place on November 17.
"The Karlsruhe University has a great share of the festival."
"Among the participants is also the choir of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Humanist Studies, and in the Festival Committee, among others, the Rector Václav Hampl," led the head of the organization team, Jakub Čaloun.
The perfect highlight of the festival is the public concert of specialist schools, which will take place on 17 November from 2 pm on the square in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
The program includes the composition of the important Czech jazz Karel Růžička "Celebration Jazz Mass."
In the evenings, the "Students of the Sized Revolution" (Studenty sametu) concert will take place in the gallery rooms of the House of Representatives in Vinohrady, where higher education choruses also occur, not excluded from the choirs of the Charles University.
Festa Academica is the goal of not only celebrating the World Student Day worthy and commemorating the 22nd anniversary of the Samten Revolution, but of presenting choir music to the public at the highest level and promoting the creative cooperation of young people.
The main organiser is the association of Czech choirs in cooperation with the Johannes Kepler Gymnasium.
The whole event was supported by Bohuslav Svoboda, the mayor of the capital Prague and Václaw Hampl, the rector of the Charles University.
The festival will take place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and in Pardubice.
The schedule includes numerous music meetings, student happanings, matinees and other events.
Detailed information can be found on the website of the festival www.festakamica.cz
EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negatists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has put the balance between the different institutions in a tangible way."
I didn't expect such a hard war to burn. "
"It will take five or six years to smooth the waves and get used to their new role," Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
It has already shown how serious it takes the motto "understandable and open about Europe" in the first part of its lecture, in which it was able to describe the individual institutions of the EU and their mutual relations in such a manageable and understandable way that it could have been the envy of some of the lecturers of the Faculty of Law of the Karlsruhe University.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new permanent President of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, criticism became loud that he was too inconspicuous - a grey official who had not grown up to such a role, but I must say, it has taken everyone's breath as well as he has taken it.
"He is a person who is ready to listen patiently to twenty-seven Member States, to communicate with them and, above all, to have clear ideas about how to proceed with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained it as an answer to the question: who is this, in fact, - the European Union? What number should I call?, "as an important step towards the agreement and better readability of EU policy towards states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our oil-masked quail.
Mrs Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda under which the European Union lived, lives and intends to live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago called it a success.
The Czechs would have mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also organised the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The case of the government during the Presidency was described as a major negative, which had seriously damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently fully involved.
In the words of the Ambassador, it was not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, that was quite hectic.
And there is still a need to approve the EU's seven-year budget, which makes things much more complicated because of the current economic situation.
Whether it will be a slim and economical budget, which sectors are given priority, which countries are more and less encouraged - all this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also reminded her of her own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "Understanding about Europe."
"If I don't like something, then it's a cruel shortcut, a foreign killer and a professional jargon that no one understands.
How should I know, as a citizen, whether you really are thinking of crooked cucumbers or round cucumbers and different large bananas in Brussels or whether someone is actually trying to ban us from quails?
It would also have liked to use the EU's soil to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
In the opinion of the EU ambassador, the Czechs are called upon to be Eurosceptics who perceive more the negative than the positive side of the matter.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is all the more annoying.
This is due to many factors, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to write letters of motivation and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, when a pole or ungar comes to me and a Slovak is near, the Frenchman next to me says," Hey, what are your heads together - is that your V4 again? "and makes a pretty sour mee.
According to Mrs Vicenové, the EU is expected in the future to have tough rules on Member States' budget policies.
As much more real than a "European Federation," it looks at the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have the countries of the euro area and the countries away from the euro area.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time it was said that only the countries that want it and those who do not want it should be left alone."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which ultimately leads to a strong 'Europe of different speeds'," Mrs Vicenová expects.
In this respect, it also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the enforcement of the principle that all issues with an impact on the EU as a whole should be discussed by all Member States and not just by the euro area countries.
Brand Story:
The Innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If you wanted to look for a suitable word, that IBM's strategy is the most accurate one, this would be the word "longevity."
For the general public, IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, you know it as a modern company, although since its foundation a century has passed.
The basis for this longevity was already her first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
He already represented the slogan that countless global problems could easily be solved if people were prepared to think a little bit.
His slogan "Think!" became the brand to which the life of the future giant was to be played (and at the same time the title of the company's internal magazine, which was already started at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of the company culture prepared by Watsen.
"For us from IBM this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also successful for a whole century because it remained faithful to its principles and did not fear to change everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform technologies, business and society in the course of our first century.
We hope that we will create even more in the next hundred years, "said Samuel J. Palmisano, today's director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary.
A well-thought-out system
Watson was already in social care for his employees in the 1930s - in the same way as the entrepreneur Baźa in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people had a holiday paid as one of the first American employees, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as working clothes and a well-thought-out pay system for the best new and dealer.
The long-term relations of IBM with their customers are equally well-known.
The company was brilliant in the promotion of talent from the beginning - as one of the first companies in the world, IBM lifted any discrimination - and was able to choose from it.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan, which is being changed by a woman at the top of IBM next year - from Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years, and so far she has taken the position of the chief of the vets, marketing and strategy.
IBM has been making so-called online brainstormings in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations are growing.
No wonder - there are ideas enough, almost half a million people are employed in the company.
An institution with good reputation
Its unshakeable position in business guarantees the company a strong image, both inside and outside.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than just a technology company," Economist said the professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss's Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems through technology," added George Colony of consulting company Forrester Research.
As the company itself stresses, it is a difference to be present on the market or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of their logo for family called "Big Blue," has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies in the world - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consultation services in an incredible product range - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies IBM has the most patents and already five of its employees have been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most famous inventions include, for example, bank machines, credit cards, financial swap, string code or also the diskette.
With about $220 billion (market capitalisation), IBM was the second largest technology company this year (just after Apple), with Microsoft first overtaking it since 1996.
The look ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - for example, the attempt with their own OS / 2 operating system, the online service Prodigy or also the computers IBM PC Jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you must not be emotionally bound to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That is why IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms - and if they do not work to leave them again.
Unlike Microsoft, which in principle stands and falls with its operating system Windows.
Proper technologies
Services, software and hardware participate to a large extent in IBM's profits.
In 1990, hardware with a more than 50% share was the most represented.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-profit assets worth $15 billion, but at the same time it invested $58 billion in the purchase of future-powerful technologies.
In these investments IBM continues after 2008, when the modern financial crisis for the first time was a storm over the world.
Here again IBM remained faithful to the legacy of his first head Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investment in the middle of the major global economic crisis.
So far, it seems that IBM is going to survive today's crisis without prejudice.
The value of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent since 2008 and the company's net profit is growing continuously.
IBM's business slogan is: everything can be changed - only the values can't be changed.
This is also why it can be expected that this flexible giant will also be able to cope with the next crisis.
IBM history: From cheese cutting to world flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines), founded a hundred years ago in New York, initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was not taken over until 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation stone of IBM's later company was the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They had technologies such as the famous card watches to register the start and end of the work.
Charles Ranlett Flint became the architect of this new company, who had also been chairman of the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired the head of the competition company Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
This leader even shaved the founders of IBM - based on Watson's ideas to date, the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name tells us, began with the production and distribution of all possible machines for trade - from sausages and cheese cutting, to cash.
In the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he was in the head chair for forty years, only then was he replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, NASA's technicians and computers helped lead NASA flights to space - to Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also to the famous human flight to the moon.
Meanwhile IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture in 1964 - the IBM System / 360 series.
A classic PC, which defined the computer standard of that time, was launched in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it bought the consultation part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus became fully involved in the business of consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off in the last three years is the concept of "smart planet."
It embodies the intention to use technologies in a smart way in areas not even planned so far, for example to improve the situation in transport and urban management.
In the trade sector, IBM recently introduced the Smart Commerce platform to help traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
Already in 1932 IBM founded a branch in Czechoslovakia - the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central and Eastern Europe Centre is located in Prague and here is also a world-level top research team that deals with the technology of voice recognition.
Darina Rychtářová over her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now is the end!
After her spouse Josef Rychtáť (53) became a lover of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina remained the hope that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the rest of life it has set itself clear rules.
"Joseph can come home, but no more than my partner," said D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová, the singer I Bartošová, had offered refuge in her own house, she would not have even remembered the dream of her husband.
When Iveta moved back to říčany after 30 days, Joseph went with her.
Yes, he even confessed publicly that he loved her.
With time, Darina signed, yes, it even seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful man again - but now she finally gave him the pass.
Rychytáť it doesn't matter who his wife is sleeping with
If Rychtáť Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, then he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams, and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not drive him out."
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a person to whom I still have certain ties," she told Mrs Rychtářová, but she also said that she had already been emotionally separated from him and insisted only on mutual independence.
The fact that Darina has locked his back door has so far been with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I stay with Iveta, nothing changes that."
"My wife wants a paper marriage, and I respect that."
"The company continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I make the purchases."
"With Darina I have a normal conversation, only we do not share the bed," said J. Rychtáť (the leaf) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he wouldn't want to stop her.
"We don't sleep together, so I don't care if she has a friend or who that is.
I know that's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and that's why I take all the responsibility.
The worst female unvirtues, what about you?
When you ask the men to call some typical female invirtues, they shake some of them out of the sleeve without exception.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we let a few unseated revue happen again, that let the men have the blood in their veins?
Purchasing
Does their husband accuse them of being a good-looking man?
Do you have to buy at least one hater a week?
Do you like to go shopping and can it be a little more in action?
Then it's really a weakness in your case.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping lust under control.
But hand-to-heart, which woman can do it in search of a well-sitting upper clothing only by a dress shop and not to try out all (in all possible colour combinations) in the cabin?
Even though shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often pure hell.
Why don't you think about how many times they've told your husband - you'd better stay out...
Constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I should take at least five kilos - should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?"
"Do I even like you?"
Does that look familiar to them?
Yeah?
Then you are also one of the women who are quite obsessed with what they look like.
That doesn't mean you should let yourself go, but many men are allergic to it when their wife is constantly complaining about her appearance.
The stronger sex is agreed - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are increasingly intolerant.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's a fight against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust, wash the tub - and this at least twice a week.
Pity with your partner, because he is again tramping with dirty shoes on the clean tiles, you shred the kids because the just-cleaned sink is dirty again and because the glass door on the living room closet has fingerprints again, where the polishing is so much trouble?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviance," you should know that you cannot exaggerate anything and that the order and cleanliness in family life are not the first place.
In the end, this measure-free purity flaw can also damage the mutual relations and, above all, the rest of the family.
Styons
"Dirty gymnastics come into the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to put on the old socks again tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you must not be surprised that this will bring him to the palm.
Of course it's not a bad thing, they just want everything to be in order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not need to be so much to complain about.
Klatsch and Tratsch
Some women like to clap and sway, there is a cross behind their back, or even slandered, or you make alliances.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to hitch through such issues, such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
I guess each of us women have a little harmless gossip and a little gossip in stock.
Hands on the heart - that's probably all women's own.
But this is not to be confused with the clatter's greatest calibers, to which nothing and no one is holy, who probably despise everyone in their environment and which are a significant danger to women's groups in particular.
Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia win with her assistants
The ice hockey tower Jaromír Jágr had a large share in the 5-3 victory of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina at the NHL's assembly game with two assists, and is thus again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases Claude Giroux, who added an assistant and was called the best player of the match, was the beneficiary of the overview of the nine and thirty-year-old ice hockey star.
Two assists in the same game also recorded Jágr's fellow player Jakub Voráček.
After the game, Jágr claimed to journalists that he had prophesied a great evening.
"Even before the game, I tell him that he has a hat trick today."
I kind of felt that way. "
"A feeling of this kind happens again and again," said Jágr, after his action, Giroux already achieved a goal at the first shot of the flyers.
A little later the second hit also had "a Czech trail."
Voráček got the puck behind the gate of the Hurricanes and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
One second before the first third of the play, the home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short hand, but the second third was again the flyer.
Specifically, Giroux.
In cooperation with Jágr, he scored his third hit, and then Wayne Simmonds led his shot to the fourth gate.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's probably one of the best three," Jágr appreciated his center.
"I would not have thought in my life that, at the end of my career, I would play with such an ice hockey player as with him."
"I'm so glad."
"I'm cutting my game to me."
"All these years in the NHL, my fellow players put their game on me and now the skewer turns around," Jágr drenched.
Carolina made the game a drama - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who won a penalty, came to a goal.
But Matt Read prevented any further complication in which he was successful in excess of two against one.
"Excellent Pronger still acted in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took a ride, and (Read) went to more remote posts."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it worked out," Voráček described the last hit of the game from his point of view.
This victory brought Philadelphia to the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defense player of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček was injured in the game against Buffalo and in the second third, he retired because of an injury to the upper body.
The Candiers, in addition to their experience Beck, also paid off their leadership an unlost in the Penalty shooting 2: 3.
Tomáš Plekanec could not change one of the penalties.
More than the lost points probably hurt the coach of the home team the high disease-related failure in the defensive - they only finished the game with five defensive players.
"That's bad."
"The encounter we played with only one experienced player ended, the rest were young players."
"But nothing can be done, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"Every time we change, one wave of attack after another, and we had nothing to do with it."
"We should have made the game easier and brought the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here, "said P. K. Subban, one of the defensive players.
The Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec defended thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed significantly to the 5-2 victory over Winnipeg.
In the gates of the jets, which ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters were involved.
Travel price trends since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five state travel agencies approved in the then ČSSR: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autoturist.
At that time, the travel agencies sold only to the socialist East Bloc countries, and in the West only the chosen were allowed at that time.
And so Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (to the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the peninsula of Crimea on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was also possible to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore the travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that it was not even allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
At that time the travel agencies also offered to travel to the West, but then you had to buy huge snakes or stay in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel office.
This was not the way things were going.
The so-called foreign exchange commitment - the condition for an exit to the West - was only given to "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely replaceable currency, so it would have been impossible to obtain the necessary financial resources (Western currency) for a journey to the West without a foreign exchange agreement.
The vast majority of Czechs therefore spent their holidays in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dates - a habit that continues until today.
The round revolution of 1989 followed a journey revolution of the Czechs on their feet.
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries all over the world last year.
A huge paradox, which is no longer known today, is the fact that it was not possible to travel to the most popular country of the Czech Republic - Croatia until 1989, because it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 1990s, the foreign exchange obligation was lifted to the neighbouring Western European countries, which caused a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough of their journeys to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to be there for at least a few days.
The Czech holidaymakers slept in the tent in the park when they were travelling to Paris, because who would have had the money to stay in the hotel or in a guesthouse at that time.
A typical feature of Czech travel abroad was then a trunk filled with canned, beer and permanent sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely replaceable Czech crown - after decades our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely.
Our level of living and the average salaries thus also increased, which in 1997 led to another important moment.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, the travel agencies started to prepare regular travel through charter flights after 1997, thus allowing flights to negotiate volume discounts to be unbelievably reduced in comparison to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czech Republic, with the exception of the United States, already had a deficit in payments with all the highly developed countries in the world, which made travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-assembled" travel was in 2000 when, thanks to the high demand, the first direct charter flight to an exotic country was made - to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers have been flying in far-away sunny countries every year; this year, 12 exotic destinations are flying directly from the Czech Republic.
To the 100 Tsd Czechs travel every year in exotic countries!
Another important moment in the era, which marked our "post-revolutionary" development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the US lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country definitely among the highly developed countries of the world.
In 2008, the Czech authorities spent more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they spent more than 15 Tsd per capita on a single holiday stay, including the cost of the holiday place.
The General Assembly is to find a new chairman - again a patent is threatening.
For almost five months now, the Czech football has not been chairman, and the successor of Ivan Hašek at the top of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not be known even after the extraordinary general meeting in Nymburk on Thursday.
The vote will take place at the next voting time.
And without this, no vote on the three potential successors is possible at all.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his position, asking his colleagues to agree and find a strong personality that could lead football in the future.
Only - in the era to Hašek the old quails broke out again between the two chambers of association, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was clear and clear on 16 September, when the new president was to be selected.
The delegates of the General Assembly had come to the People's House in the Prague district of Smíchov for free, because the trial did not lead to any result, and this was not just about the election itself.
One could not even agree on who is actually entitled to vote in the full collection - only the statutory representatives or also the officials with a power of authority.
In this single point, at least part of the agreement was reached, to which the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law also contributed, in the opinion of which a representation on the basis of power was not valid.
However, the disputes about the electoral order continue.
The Executive Committee was also no longer clear at its meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary, in principle nothing else is on the agenda at all.
Even if the views about the election changed a few times - the neural point remained the same.
The question is: how should we proceed in the third round in order to avoid a patting situation?
"The point of dispute concerns whether to act in accordance with the Statute or whether to find a completely different model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, who represents professional football in the management.
In the third round, according to the standard model, the candidate who receives the greater percentage of support in the chamber for which he is running is winning.
Moravia is supposedly willing to respond to the compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers will win.
The Czech side, in turn, insists on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage vote.
"Then the two preliminary rounds have no sense at all, this mode would question the entire two-chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, which would best not to add the electoral order but to choose according to the valid statutes.
Tomáš Paclík is also in agreement with this, although it is clear that the electoral order of all candidates is most likely to meet Pelta.
"My wish is to be elected as much as possible according to the statutes."
"In order not to make up insanely replacement variants, as at the last Annual General Meeting," the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who for the first time ran for the first time and, in his comments, was particularly close to Pelta.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
He believes that the new president will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the football EM today would certainly help to calm the minds."
"If football is only on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to work together is also greater," says Jablonec, the Jablonec, who brings with it the greatest experience of all three Adepts, both at professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately two-fold."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts to" correct "the rules for their own purposes."
"Therefore, a new block at the General Meeting is not excluded."
"I hope, however, that common sense will eventually win," said Rajchl.
Only - there is no time to agree on all sides.
Some negotiations are supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete until the qualification game is in place.
The charter aircraft, with which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were to fly to Podgorice, was not able to start in the morning because of a technical disturbance, and so they were fiercely looking for a replacement variant, as to bring part of the Executive Committee to the location of the Barrage-Hangel.
In the end, the meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to be held on Wednesday, is important.
Josef Dobeš, the Minister for Education, Youth and Body Education would have liked to have led the split parties within the country's largest sports association to reach an agreement.
There is much at stake: state subsidies, the confidence of Czech football and also the forthcoming General Meeting of ČSTV, which is to lead Czech sport in the new direction following the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík is in the fight for the position of president because he does not see a suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner football player, could have made a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Czech Republic Football Association (FAČR), he would not have been at all involved in the fight for this top position.
"If there was a good candidate, I would fight for him and give up the choice."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a breath," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go into the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is therefore to prevent the supposed favorites of the choice, Pelta, from getting to the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that, in the event of his victory, he intends to perform the function of chairman only for a year, that is, until 2013, until the date of the ordinary general meeting.
In the position of the chairman, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too much involved in football.
"I have spoken to some of the people in question in person."
"It's hard to believe that some of them told me they didn't want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have liked to have changed," he said.
Most of all, Paclík is allegedly disturbing the connection between Pelta's and the chairman of the Pilsner district football association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation, who is considered a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegates' votes at general meetings.
For Paclík it is therefore unacceptable that Pelta should have the position of president.
"In his victory, today's state would be conserved and Czech football would not progress at all."
"The support of Berbr, a smart business man, is twice as bad for football," said Paclík.
He also claims that Pelta's name fell in connection with phone calls to investigate a corruption affair some time ago, but from which Pelta was found to be impeccable.
"I don't know what prestige a victory of Pelta should bring to football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík, who saw his previous saying, "he will sell the Pilsner football club when Pelta becomes chairman," but he already sees something more late.
If Paclík wins in the Thursday election, he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
The same is true of another candidate - Rajchl, whom Paclík had supported before the October general meeting, which ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to go to."
"He has great skills."
"I could imagine him as the head of the national team, for example."
"But I don't think he's able to run the association as a manager."
"I do not put my nose in matters of which I do not understand," said Paclík, who in September had made an appearance that he was at the top behind the call of the Arbitration Commission with Luěk Macela, who replaced Dagmar Damková.
Mr Paclík himself claims that he is well aware of the role of the President of the Association.
He is also the head of Pilsen, who, with his support in May, celebrated the first triumph in the league.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and to contribute to a certain cultivation of this."
"In order to limit the influence of certain stakeholders who tend to influence disciplinary and appeal commissions, which is going to be the result of conflicting situations," Paclík pointed out, which does not make any sense of his antipathy, for example, to the Sparta chief Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he saw the strengthening of the relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he would lobbying the political leaders for more money from the lottery tax to go to sport.
"This is one of the key things the new chairman should be dedicated to."
"When it comes to the taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argument, but they also have to say where the money is going," he said.
His connection to the Pilsner club also does not consider Paclík to be a handicap, although he himself stresses that the chairman of the FAČR must be "overpartisan."
Pelta is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
"That's not exactly ideal."
"However, I do not think it makes much sense to transfer my shares in the Pilsner club to a third party in order to return after a year and a half," said Paclík.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which will lead to a patting situation in the future.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Presidential Office, Miroslav Pelta, promised that in the event of his election, he would make himself strong for the FAČR to have new statutes that will in future rule out disputes about the electoral order.
The Jablonec official is confident before the Thursday negotiations in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will certainly disarm in the event of a possible success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September that he would focus on the national team and the acquisition of funds in the event of his election.
He only decided to take part in the election before the last general meeting, so the two-month break would help him to defend his ideas about the direction of football and to present it in a wider context.
"People at all levels are devoted to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time that the association was led by someone, says the man who is especially connected to the Jabloneca club, but who also acted for many years at Sparta and in the Executive Committee.
He also believes that he has sufficient experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that the euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Hašek is responsible for today's problems with the election.
"Unfortunately, the General Assembly in June approved statutes that were not as perfect as all of them had accepted.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have already had a chairman from September, "said Pelta.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the civil society that he used as a means of loosening delegates.
"If I become president, I will take this personally and I will be prepared to take personal responsibility if it does not work."
"This is a fundamental thing that he can't be without," Pelta says.
In addition, he does not try to limit himself to his counterparts.
He had already announced that he could imagine a cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl, which he recognized because of his legal education, and he knows well that his opponent was his first deputy.
Tomáš Paclík, too, did not attack him for a long time, who left no dry thread on Pelta.
He has been moving in football for over a year and can already point to certain successes. "
"However, his attacks were disappointing and many people were shocked by his campaign."
"For this reason too, many now doubt his real character," Pelta addressed to his opponent, who probably remains faithful to his proclamations, which he already expressed in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the bottom of the game classes to the national team.
And this was supposed to be Czech football.
"I would also try to end all the affair - from the Causa Bohemian to the aftermath of the corruption scandal of last year."
"Shortly after, I would go to negotiations with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient funding for the whole football," said the four-year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
At that time he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean any human cleansing.
"I would have to get acquainted with the work content of all employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where, because of the long anarchy, there is understandably nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios accompanying the forthcoming General Meeting, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for free on Thursday.
"If the only controversial point is really how to choose in the third round, then we'll get over it."
"Football needs credibility, and it only wins back when it finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR will start working hard under it
If the former Vice-President Jindřich Rajchl were to be elected to the general meeting on Thursday as the new Chairman of the Czech Republic Football Association, it would be said that many people in the association would be in a mood for this.
In fact, Rajchl promises that in the event of his choice you will start working hard.
It intends to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football and otherwise continue the work that the previous president Ivan Hašek started.
"As chairman, I would like to devote myself to football as a whole."
Starting from the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, through the national selection, professional football, to the youth performance football. "
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in the conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and therefore want to share the powers of the Executive Committee in such a way that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks so that football in each segment can move forward with milestones. "
Many would not be very pleased about this, because instead of criticizing the work of others, they would have to start working really hard themselves, "he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it was considered not to apply at all.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are standing behind me, who don't give me a lot of balls between my legs and question every step I make," he said as an explanation why he hesitated.
"But many people told me that I should not give up because others would do it."
"This is trust that is not to be played out," he said.
It is said that he is also motivated to continue the work he has started under Hašek.
"In two years we have done a great deal of work, and I don't want to just throw it away."
"Processes have been started, which are probably only to be applied in a few years and I would hate to see them stop someone," he said, expressing his concerns that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta - would be elected, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic action, and this is something Mirek Pelta does not bring."
"Behind him are above all people who would make football so that he would only be there for the chosen."
I can be accused of a few things, but not that I'm a party. "
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want football for all, because then everyone is fine and not just the chosen one," said Rajchl.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czech Republic.
"Even though some people say the opposite, I really intend to do the best I can for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a Moravian part, the winner of which then went up to the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is particularly a problem for young players in Moravia," says Rajchl.
Since the head of the Pilsner club Tomáš Paclík has now joined the fight for the president's function, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances of being elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me to be its Vice-President and now recognizes that there are clear successes behind me," said Rajchl, who also sees the saving of 60 million crowns for unfavorable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations for the Lottery Act as his success.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the fact that the association does not draw a single line.
As he says of Pelta, "he has been disqualified from the outset to retrust Czech football," he considers the second rival - Paclík to be a strong candidate who really has something to offer to football.
"No one can question that he has done excellent work in fungi in just one year."
"If he were to be elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek has initiated and also the human occupation in the commissions he would obviously not change in principle."
He would certainly not want to bend things to his advantage, "Rajchl judges over his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump into the blue
By Julia Stanek
Planschbake in Ufo-Optik, Prunkpool in Budapest: If you travel through Europe, you can experience your blue miracle - and after a city tour or a walk you can rest your tired legs in sproudelbädern.
A book shows where wellness in the water is most beautiful.
If Iris Meder went on a search trip in the past one and a half years, one in her luggage was not to be missed: her bathing suit.
Lying back on the water, she looked high in artistically designed cupola, she swam towards marble wells that waited for her at the edge of the pool, and surprised at the acritically restored youth-style swimming halls.
If she had a bath, she included it in her notebook - with the knowledge of the building's design and history.
More than 200 swimming pools explored architectural historians in this way - and now presents them in her recently published book "bathing delights": folk swimming halls in Munich, historical bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries she was "travelling to the most extraordinary bathrooms in Central Europe": in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and each one in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
With sports she doesn't have much on her mind, says Meder - only in the water is that different.
The only thing that's troublesome is that swimming fans with blue tiles and chocolates have to get away, while joggers can breathe in the daring scent of fir forests or listen to happy bird chisels in the park.
"One day I was wondering why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the Meder living in Vienna.
"So I started to collect beautiful baths."
Water surface doubles architecture
Speakers in the jumping pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in bathrooms is so great because all senses are served, says Meder.
And when the builders have tried, swimming halls can be a real eye-cheater: "Instead of a floor you have a water surface in bathrooms."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles in the face: high vaults, colorful tiles, springboards.
The small-format picture band "Bathing delights" provides information on the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oasis on 190 pages - but above all makes a desire to jump into the blue.
The pool collector Meder discovered remarkable copies during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent healing baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi-Bad in Budapest, she found a nitrates-containing water in an ancient cartilage cave (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath, whose basin is filled with alkaline water and is located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria: while you have the whole city in mind from the Zurich Dachbad, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: There is a window in the steam bath, from which you can watch the driving on the ski slopes.
The perhaps most exceptional pool design awaits guests in Längenfeld: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a straight-up Ufo in the Alps.
From three up-open bowls it is steam in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Oetztal are in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not every swimming pool, the pool collector Meder got into the nose of the smell of chlorine.
Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, in the Árpád-Bad in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells so much of fuel oil, which is hardly believed to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen-carbonate-containing healing water, which is almost black and whose bad is attached to your skin as soon as you can slide into the pelvis - a wellness experience of the special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing sites: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing pool in the Czech Bad Luhatschowitz, she found a closed terrain.
The bathroom, designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic, was now closed.
When Meder took a look through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow youth-style building, she saw the weeds growing between the tiles.
On the other hand, it has been counteracted by a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three construction phases already have this bathroom behind them; you can discover not only neoromaniac elements that come from the times of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernisation in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite bath of the pool connoisseur Iris Meder - not only because it was originally from the Black Forest.
"It is already a performance to merge so different styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
With such a palace the dive in the thermal pool is apparently only a side matter.
Agrar-speculation
Deutsche Bank is making the raw material business clear
By Christian Teevs
Does the Deutsche Bank give up its business in agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the Group Chief would like to draw conclusions.
Hamburg -
The matter is clear to the federal citizens: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize, according to a study.
Two thirds of the respondents are calling for Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions to get out of this business because it is exacerbating the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report that Foodwatch presented in mid-October.
In this, the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global commodity exchanges drive prices up - and therefore the banks bear a share of the global hunger problem.
The campaign of consumer protection is directed specifically against German bank head Josef Ackermann, even if large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similar.
Originally, commodity laws were designed to protect traders against price fluctuations.
But most experts now agree that the zockers have decoupled themselves from supply and demand - and at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike the US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: He promised to examine the allegations and said that no business was worth "putting the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at risk."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
The audit will be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank - with a recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the head of the bank will then tell us what consequences it is drawing.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the raw material business, or even a complete return.
Ackermann makes his image
Foodwatch Chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The betting on rising prices of food shows particularly dramatically how reckless banks today damage the general good."
Ackermann is now the top lobbyist in the world.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all assets from its portfolio that use money for betting on food prices," said Bode.
"No matter whether Mr Ackermann is about people suffering from hunger or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
The insight of Ackermann comes at first glance surprising, but it is clear that the Group Chief wants to give a perfect picture a few months before he leaves the Office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the board will not change to the Supervisory Board.
With a turn from the controversial agrar speculation, he could improve his image.
And for possible losses he hardly needs to be shaved - that would have to do with his successor.
Each second would terminate raw material plants
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high.
More than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organisation's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute questioned 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
It is therefore only 11% that it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer facilities that are bet on food prices.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such transactions: According to the survey, each second would terminate all the facilities in which money flows into the raw material speculation.
43 percent would advise acquaintances from such a bank, 49 percent said to think about quitting their account and moving to another institution.
21st house in Vienna
The moved pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with heights, depths and happy ends: The Austrian World Exhibition Villages of Brussels in 1958 won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, was empty and lost.
Now it is reopened as an exhibition house.
If it is heated by modern post-war architecture, by clear forms, glass halls, courageous swings and new building materials typical of the faith in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer is a striking and famous example for the Brussels World Exhibition in 1958.
Schwanzer's pavilion was then awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and floating steel-glass construction.
The construction is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so known that he also built the pavilion at the next world exhibition in Austria.
In 1973, he became internationally famous with his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus a classy side-building in Munich.
After the World Exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the Vienna Südbahnhof, the pavilion was built, rebuilt and opened in 1962 a museum of the 20th century - the "20's house" was called.
But the building was not suitable for space and technology as a museum - no walls to hang art, no good climate.
However, it was used for so long until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001 the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krishanitz has remodeled the pavilion, now called "21's house" and is used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.
On Tuesday night the Museum Belvedere, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a fall of luck in every respect.
In 2007, Agnes Husslein-Arco became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, with a significant career in the youth as an ice-skating racer, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and the founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, strongly promoted the conversion with politicians and monuments, she acquired public funds and private sponsors and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there should be a café and a bookstore, and an office house had to be built for this.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the implementation then Krishanitz was the ideal occupation.
Not only because he had developed and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession sensibly in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the Pavilion was a "very important place" for him, where he had looked at the exhibitions "almost every weekend."
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost in its transfer to Vienna and its use of generosity and ease.
There were far more problems with the current reconstruction: the building was "an energy sling," says Krishanitz.
The window profiles of the glass façade were replaced, glass fibre-reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel carriers have been reinforced or replaced and asbestos-filled ceilings have been renovated.
Two lower floors brought space for the new use, a cut-off light ditch between house and street ensures exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light swan pavilion.
The original outside doors have remained, the house is painted in the old red-brown rust-protection tone.
And the cinema room is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the Memorial Authority and with a small budget.
"It was often necessary to find a material that is good and cheap and also liked the Department of Monuments," says Krishanitz, pointing to a rugged ground in the lower floor.
Despite all the constraints, problems and changes, the building has remained flexible and easy.
It was difficult with the pavilion, "which came from Brussels," Krishanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-city story."
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wanted "to raise a real consciousness."
In this case, however, the 21 house is not in the wrong place, because there is a city-building case of luck: the completely newly planned "Hauptbahnhof" district, with office and residential buildings, is being created around the Swiss garden.
And another lucky case may occur: the 21's house could be reinforced by another Krishanitz building, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art hall, and as you can hear, she is already negotiating with the city for a neighbourly location in the Swiss garden.
Railway plans winter crisis package in million height
The train has developed a crisis plan to prevent train failures in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It's gonna cost millions.
In the fight against winter-related train failures and delays, the Deutsche Bahn also spends more than 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The "Bild" newspaper reported in advance on the basis of a group-internal crisis plan that investments of around EUR 300 million were planned by 2015.
This should ensure better availability of vehicles and rail networks even in the event of extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external staff for the removal of snow on railway systems and platforms to 16,000 people.
The aim was to free platforms from snow and ice within four to five hours until the start of operation and 90 per cent of the necessary course of operation.
Two months ago, railway boss Rüdiger Grube had warned about train failures and delays after a high-level meeting with government and industry this winter.
Last winter, the rail had considerable problems in passenger transport, as it is lacking in reserves, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railway Office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The train has also been making it possible for years to have the axles of ICE trains tested significantly more frequently in the workshop after an ICE in Cologne's main station had an axle break.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of dollars in the USA
After the tumult around the head Josef Ackermann comes new inconvenience from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for Deutsche Bank at home, the industry giant is now getting its past in the US: the Frankfurt Institute is paying a comparison of 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to settle disputes about the failure of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about the sale of mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA is proposing a whole range of large banks to have led the cooperative banks to purchase the financial products with false promises, and they would have played down the risks.
Such papers lost their value during the financial crisis and tore the banks into the deep.
"We are satisfied that we were able to solve the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a German bank spokesman in New York.
The bank did not issue a debt with the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed itself to the payment of 20.5 million dollars.
The NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the arrival of the two cash houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the US cooperative banks and is in charge of pleading to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to replace the damage caused by the millions of years of damage.
The now closed comparisons are the first of their kind
The regulator had also bequeathed other large banks and in the summer JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The mortgage securities in question are so-called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on house loans.
When the US real estate bubble broke in 2007, this became a liability to a large number of financial companies.
In September 2008, at the peak of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers tilted.
Even though the events have been a few years ago, the banks are currently facing a sharp wind in the US.
Investors and supervisory authorities have committed countless actions to obtain compensation or to apprehend misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has given rise to the largest complaint.
It is proposing 18 international large banks that have overtaken the two state-owned real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions in the volume of around $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has to face a complaint from FHFA, which is about several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires that the Frankfurt authorities stand up for "substantial losses" without, however, giving an exact sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as untenable and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett gets up with 10 billion at IBM
Finanzguru Buffett is investing strongly in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always declared not to invest in IT and computer companies, because the long-term development of the companies can only be poorly predicted.
But now he has read IBM's annual reports and changed his opinion on investment in the industry.
He had to understand a long time ago that IBM was mainly providing services and providing computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
One investment by Warren Buffett is considered to be a knights hit in the financial world.
As a result, the IT original stone IBM can now call itself "Sir IBM."
Because Buffett now revealed in the US economic channel CNBC that since March he has bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus increased to one of IBM's largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that not even IBM had known anything about the commitment so far.
He praised the management that, even in the economic crisis, had still provided proper profits.
"You did a great job," said Buffett on the strategy.
IBM has for some time been relying on the lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centres.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had been avoiding technology companies so far.
He says he only invest in companies whose business he also understands.
Instead, Buffett attacked a freight railway, a lubricant manufacturer or mechanical engineering.
His holding company Berkshire Hathaway also holds shares in a number of large companies such as Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, the former Munich Rek.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and expanded it with smart investments to one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unmistakable sense of money-making has given him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha."
After the Buffett investment was announced, the IBM share increased by one percent in the first time.
"Big Blue," as IBM is also called, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock exchange, making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world together with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, but he didn't want to get in.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Cell" Turkish media doubt the German state of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology," which now relive.
The murders of eight Turkish people and a Greek small enterprise in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This message is addressed with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German Turkish population in Germany.
For many German-Turkish people, this is a long-lost ghost: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence against Turks with a right-wing extremist background.
The fact that there is xenophobia in Germany was never in question.
However, the uncovered right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is far from foreseeable.
"Does the bloody ideology live up again?" the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk" tipped.
The "Sabah" newspaper, on the other hand, stresses that one of the perpetrators is supposed to have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities may also be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community of Germany responded to the sun: on the weekend with a memorial watch in front of the Brandenburg Gate, it reminded the victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had thought of the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In happy colors, co-operation was staged - as a story of success.
The report of some Turkish media is like an earring: "Germany's gift to the fiftieth" is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X," which renews the background of the murder series.
The German edition of the "Hürriyet" cannot be used to draw this spiritual connection.
"It starts to stink," is the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people had been murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
The actions of the police and their subsequent prosecution will be discussed very critically in German-Turkish Internet forums.
The authors wonder why the German authorities had not thought of looking for suspects in the right-wing extremist circles.
Some people are at least in a rhetorically ready for drastic means: "If there is still a clamp here, there is nothing left for migrants but self-defence and arms."
"This must be the best self-protection."
"The quality of the information and adequacy of the punishment of the entire network depends very much on the inner peace in Germany," writes "Selen."
What it means when the internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s are clear.
The photo of the fire ruin of Solingen is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has made it clear to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans that mistrust and distance can lead to right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, sharpened the feeling of us on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics after the attacks was first and foremost a problem: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire attack of Solingen, he sent an accompanying telegram to the Turkish President, but at the funeral ceremony in Cologne he was represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - at that time, Kinkel counted in his speech how many charges the local Turks made.
It's like a person's value is calculated by the amount of his tax duties.
The current reporting of the Turkish media shows once again how deeply the distrust of many German Turks has been in the local rule of law since then.
In addition to the efforts of extensive information and reassessment of the right-wing extreme terrorism in Germany, this time it needs open words.
The Skandalbank of Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS was almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since been falling from one crisis to the next.
Now it's a German judge.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think so.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank in July, he had become aware that in 2013 he would take on an almost as spectacular new job: President of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Grand Bank of UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was publicly pleased, praised Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its newly gained soundness and made friendly comments about future colleagues.
"The UBS made the turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But already in September it became clear that everything would come quite differently.
One UBS dealer in London had circumvented all the bank's security systems and had reached around EUR 1.7 billion.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker who was not only in Switzerland, had to go.
Since then, the President of the UBS's Board of Directors has also been considered to be a hit - and all the questions are: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already been announced that Weber will be able to advise the bank in February 2012.
And he is already taking over the Board of Directors in May - not only in 2013, as the Bank announced on Tuesday.
It's gonna be hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, he is an economist and a notorious banker and would certainly have needed a time-to-process.
He then takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it deserves the title "Europe's largest scandal bank."
Because the UBS is huge - until recently it was the world's largest asset manager - and has been slipping from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, is saved the once proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
The UBS had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the silent and solid, but also well-exploited Swiss asset manager had combined it with ambitious goals: it also wanted to become a very large number in investment banking.
In 2007, the UBS managed more money than any other bank in the world with $1.6 trillion.
And on the other hand, as an investment bank, it had advanced into the league of the largest banks in the world.
That was an impression.
The former banker and later long-standing bank professor in Zurich Hans Geiger says: "I always set up the UBS as a model of a good bank at that time."
"From this point of view, one wonders: how could I be so wrong?"
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it became apparent for the first time that something was due to go wrong in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, Chief of the Board, Peter Wuffli, who until then was considered to be a highly intellectual and equally brilliant banker.
A few months later, they figured out why he left.
The bank's investment partner had been using subprime papers and had to write off billions.
In order to bear this in mind, the UBS announced a capital increase in the amount of say and write down 13 billion francs.
In fact, she found investors, but some of them, who had been on the nose of some of them until recently, an intransparent Asian State Fund from Singapore and an Arab State Fund that was so silent that they didn't even know their name.
But that was just the first hit.
It was worse in April 2008.
The Bank had to announce new billion losses, President Marcel Ospiel, the second best paid board of directors in Switzerland, resigned in 2006.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS was before the collapse in view of its misinvestment in the financial crisis and had to be saved by the state.
The National Bank bought out the UBS for a number of billion problematic securities, and the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forced-to-walk loan through which it could become a co-owner of the Bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it houses such large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet total of the UBS 2007 was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
"Once again, we could not save the UBS," says Bank Research Geiger.
The first disaster was followed by the second.
A few months later, the UBS capitalised in the tax dispute with America and agreed to issue the data of good-value customers who may have been behind taxes with the help of the Bank.
It also agreed to a payment of $780 million - in order to repay unjustified profits from these transactions, including a penalty charge.
The UBS thus announced more or less openly that it had helped with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for rich customers: the nimbus of secrecy.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
It followed the resignation of the head of the board and the president of the board.
And the exodus of customer money.
The Bank had lost credibility within a few months in both central business areas: investment banking through misspeculation and asset management through tax evasion aid.
And just as it got a little quieter again, just as you thought the UBS was going to get it back to work, that's what's following this creepy dealer story: a single dealer is going to get 1.7 billion euros before the bank finds out something's going wrong.
And it turns out that the risk management in investment banking is obviously still not working.
"With the case of Adoboli, it has been noted that risk control has not changed enough," says Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the University of Zurich's banking institute.
The financial director of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem of UBS is that it does not control risk control."
It was the idea of the caution with which the Swiss bankers had long ago started to become guardians of the great assets of the world: no too big risks, for security for money - even beyond the Alpine Republic, the world was allowed to collapse.
The vault of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakeable reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fit the cliché of the dedicated Swiss private bank - it is only a little larger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its headquarters on the Zurich Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly from the main station to the Lake Zurich, which is surrounded by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the shop rent is among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany's can be found here between Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
The Swiss banks have been staying here for centuries: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to the elite private banks such as Julius Bear.
The reception hall of the UBS is entered through a heavy turning door.
Inside the walls are marble-dressed, in front of them are thick leather armchairs, next to the bank logo a large sign to the "safe."
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss Bank has both Swiss large banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point they have been forced out - or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, and finally, like all Swiss bankers, he does business with the two large banks.
The UBS had become far too large, he found - especially in investment banking, where the fishing axes had also spread.
The Swiss had nothing to say there.
"And if they do, they have long since adapted to the customs of the fishing sachs."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, gave it high profits first and then the debacle: no European financial institution lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss large bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million country decided the biggest rescue action in the history of its nation," the author of Lukas Hässig writes in his book "The UBS-Crash."
Up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros were granted by the politicians to save the large bank in front of the bank.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss large banks merged into a large group.
A bank was created that was already too big for small Switzerland in the merger - and was growing ever further.
The two different upstream banks of UBS were complementary: a rich but sleepy bank with the focus on asset management in Zurich and an poorer but already more internationalised.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers came to a lot of money, with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, Group Chief of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospiel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospiel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-intellectual, the well-known, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospiel, the belly man who has worked up from the bank to the top."
But Ospiel finally relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear that the case was a case of overweight.
UBS staff clearly remember the management meetings at which Group Chief Wuffli spent the same slogan: Goldman Sachs from the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the League Tables, the rankings that documented the success of the banks at that time.
That's where the UBS wanted to go up.
A few steps had already been taken.
She played in the foreign exchange and stock trade at the top.
However, business consultants who were commissioned highlighted a weakness: in the international interest rate business, in the banking language "Fixed Income," there was a huge distance from the largest banks.
The UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that almost cost it the existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund in front of it invested in American subprime plants.
It became a huge machine that packed and passed on securities on to American mortgage loans - but also held risks itself.
Also, when other banks long ago were looking for the exit.
"In the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there," says bank expert Geiger.
So great the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager had to go after another when the attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
Post at the UBS became a sling seat and are still wacky.
If you run the big bank now, you have an almost impossible job.
He has to find a strategy for a bank that has taken all the business models that are close to it.
Bankforscher Geiger already has an idea: stop investment banking, focus on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But the investment banking is supposed to shrink strongly, so much is already clear.
Next Thursday, the new bank manager Sergio Ermotti will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was actually only intended as a transitional solution when the bank was surprisingly separated from predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has become more effective: he is to run the UBS business permanently, the Zurich Bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to the stand in the mid-1990s.
He's tripping 3500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber is probably asking himself right now.
So far, he's just saying that he's going to be looking for an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.
Afraid of recession in Europe burdened US stock exchange
The threat of recession in Europe has taken the courage of US investors to start the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without any impact.
The industrial production on the continent has stifle the hopes of stabilising the debt crisis in the germ.
The general relief on the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be achieved.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week the Italian and Greek glass was still a half-full one, not half-empty one - but now the problems have come to the fore again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, financial values were on the sales books.
The Dow Jones index of the default values recorded a minus of 0.6 percent at 12.078 points for the trade.
In the course of trade, the market barometer was between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The broader S & P-500 index closed at 1251 points, a minus of one percent.
The Nasdaq technology exchange index lost 0.8 percent and went out of trade with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax passed with a minus of 1.2 percent at 5985 meters.
Industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced their production and is moving towards the end of the recovery.
In September, companies produced two percent less than in the previous month, as reported by Eurostat.
The US investors were skeptical about this: "We are not an island but dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to free itself from a recession so quickly, and there are further signs of weakness among banks.
The investment-leading Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
He therefore considered it too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decade-old principle over the pile and entered the US technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the share price of the traditional group and had it first recorded just under one percent higher against the trend in trade.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett has paid on average 170 dollars per piece and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of his investment company Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
The Bank of America's shares were significantly higher at 2.6% than the market.
The house is covering almost the entire rest of its shares in the China Construction Bank and is in the process of defeating $6.6 billion.
The institution intends to increase its capital ratio with the net profit from the business and thus to comply with more stringent regulatory requirements.
The aircraft builder Boeing increased and thus limited the losses in the Dow.
The share won 1.5 percent after the group had collected the largest order of its history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 type 777 long-distance machines on Sunday and estimated the value of the orders to $18 billion.
Including options for 20 more machines, the volume is even $26 billion.
At the New York Stock Exchange, around 710 million shares changed the owner.
719 values increased, 2241 were in progress, and 79 remained unchanged.
At the Nasdaq, 630 shares in the plus, 1913 in the minus and 82 remained unchanged with sales of 1.38 billion shares.
Intelligent crows spread in cities
Many places are considered to be "problem birds": But from the cities the highly intelligent animals can no longer be distributed, experts claim.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly: crows have been part of the city's image for centuries, but in many municipalities there are a lot of people who have problems about the dirt and the noise of the animals.
A means of combating the "problem birds" is not yet in sight.
The first crop symposium in the East Frisian Leer said that the seeds were no longer to be found from the cities.
There, experts from all over the federal territory consulted about possible ways out.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
The problems in cities also led to the land-run of the particularly protected seeds: the use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroyed the traditional habitats.
The hunting, growing construction and the fall of typical breeding trees made life difficult for the birds.
Crow is under nature protection.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs, among others in the Western Soest, in the northwest, in Jever, Diepholz and Ahim near Bremen and in Leer.
There in 2005, a controversial project for the mass killing of crows in the district had provided negative headlines.
Critics had called the catch of the animals in bird traps and the killing of the animals with the knuckles particularly brutal.
"The normal extermination, the burial, is nothing," the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver from Leer has noted.
Dust with water or fall trees, often have undesirable consequences, also said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals depart, large colonies split up and spread in other places."
The only exception to hospitals, old-age homes, or schools is to be found in the way of a marriage.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them out of here."
Without the surrounding area, the problem in the cities cannot be solved, Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer said.
A combination of animals from sensitive residential areas and lockers could be considered in order to relocate them in other places.
The psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgen, on the other hand, called for a completely different approach to the animals: "After all, we can only stand a pimple on the face by ourselves."
In Schleswig-Holstein, Jürgen had co-founded the Ascheberger Krahen-Lehrfad, on which the signs of the life of the highly intelligent seeds were informed.
The project is already accepted by tourists.
On the criticism of the noise of the birds, Jürgen had his own opinion: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: seed crows not only use tools to get a treat, but make their own tools as a tool.
The University of Cambridge's behavioral researchers have recently tested four seed crops to see how far the intelligence of the birds is.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they have to bring down a scaffolding with stones to get to a moth larva.
Without much training, they realized the size and shape of a stone to allow the platform to collapse.
In a second attempt, the fixed crow had to solve a more difficult problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
With the beak, the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had laid down wire pieces for them.
From this, all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then apply the bucket to the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seeds even managed to do this at once.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at EM 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup remained.
The favorites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and also Ireland are present at the EM 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
led by the double-successful Superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal hit Bosnia and Herzegovina 6: 2 (2: 1) and made the fifth EM participation in a row perfect after 0: 0.
The Czechs had a 1: 0 (0: 0) in the play-off backgame with outsiders Montenegro after the play (2: 0) had already been a clear thing.
There was nothing more that allowed Croatia to burn at 0-0 against Turkey, and Ireland got a loose 1-1 (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) achieved the further results for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburg Bundesliga-Profi Zvjezdan Misimovic with a changed trade meter (41.) and Captain Emir Spasic (65.) had shortened twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the 2010 World Cup games off in South Africa to Portugal.
In the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal was able to get a good start.
Ronaldo took a free blow from about 30 meters to the early lead into the mash.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his wide-shot qualities and met from 25 meters to 2: 0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance by Torhunter Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg of the English table leader Manchester City put a head ball on the lower edge of the latte, but the ball did not cross the gate line (33).
Jiracek meets for the Czech Republic
After that, referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was the focus.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian criminal area, Stark decided on a swalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trade meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, who Misimovic certainly turned.
But after the break, the 2004 Vice-European Champion made everything clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also finished the final doubts in the 81st minute.
This is the fifth time the European champion of 1976 has been going to the EM.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga Legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nürnberg) was also lucky and had to survive a terrible second in the early phase.
Endmann Petr Cech, with a reflex at the last moment, prevented a possible owner gate by Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had its greatest possibilities when the Duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from the turn of the criminal space border just past the gate of Cech.
After the break the cross latte had to save for the already beaten world-class guard of the Czechs, again the stormer of FC Seoul had withdrawn (50.).
The gate just before the end made everything clear.
Turkey, therefore, missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0: 3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not go beyond a 0: 0.
While National Trainer Guus Hiddink has to secure his place on the 2002 World Cup third bank, the Croats are pleased to have their fourth participation in an EM final round.
Before 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir stadium, the Turks almost got a dream start.
In the seventh minute, Selcuk Inan only hit the post with a distance shot, assailant Kazim Kazim could not sink the trigger in the gate.
After the horror second, however, Croatia took over more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't burn anything.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of the VfL Wolfsburg, who made a place for the Dortmunder Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga Legionäre Danijel Pranjic (Bavaria Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni goes to EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated the first EM participation in Germany since 1988.
Stephen Ward brought the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4-0 success in the rear game, in the 32 minute in the lead.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) is suitable for guests.
From the start, Ireland pressed the pace, but had to wait until 23 minutes before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian backteam prevent the possible lead.
But in the 32 minute it was time.
After a failed defense of Schlendmann Pavel Londak, Ward was in the position and pushed the ball to 1: 0 over the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP is investing billions in China over the next few years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, about two billion dollars (around 1.5 billion euros) will flow, the Dax Group announced on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and hire corresponding staff," Co-Chief Bill McDermott announced at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from currently about 2500 to 4500 employees.
The number of branches of the world market leader for business software will double from five to ten or eleven.
SAP has been present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4000 of the more than 176 000 SAP customers worldwide are in the Boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important component of the Dax Group's 2015 strategy.
SAP aims to increase sales to 20 billion euros by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfer had redeemed around EUR 12.5 billion.
Currently, the business of the software provider, who employs 55 000 employees worldwide, is almost rare.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," said McDermott.
"Our aim is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information."
Mass slaughter on a personal level
Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Horrors. A story of the First World War, tells in nineteen fates" with a long list of main people that goes to heart.
Here is a tip on how to proceed: carefully cut this page out and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in Englund's romantic story, and these main people will work as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments where you are lost like Englund's men and women in the fog of war and deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He has written an unusual book, which he does not incorrectly describe as "a work of anti-history."
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, raging reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was." It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and horror" almost the experience of war of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, become crazy or die.
Each of these lives flicks up like the votive candles in a church, some are added while others are extinguished.
Englund's book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the devastating position war on the West Front.
"Beauty and horror" with expert views of other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are the beehives, a Christmas party among the pyramids in Egypt, and tsetseflies are an insoluble problem.
This is a moving book almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina, that smells like Cordit.
Imagine you're a woman who's at home with her children, and you hear cannon fire in the distance.
Who's even coming?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is even being conducted.
"The lack of facts," Englund notes, "were raised with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and horror" follows individual people such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor.
Their stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life reports can be frightening or grieving, but they are extremely alive in Englounds of the collection of small moments lost in detail.
Many of them deal with lack and help.
In the history of a German schoolgirl, he tells: "Replacement, Replacement everywhere."
"Spare coffee, false aluminium, false rodent rubber, paper associations, wooden buttons."
He tells more about the inheritance in Germany.
It describes "meat made from pressed rice and baked in hammer fat (and last served with a false bone of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato shells, shoes sown with wood."
There were, as he noted, "837 registered food substitutes that were allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge for wildness and says about the war: "You feel that, despite all this, this is what was intended for men rather than sitting in the leash, with the evening leaf or the best seller and a cigarette and a whisky in your hand, and to do so as if such a facade meant civilization and as if there were no barbarians behind his own strong and cloned shirt breast."
On the other hand, a British soldier recognizes that he is likely to die and that no one will take note of it or take care of it.
"If you take away the thought of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this is happening in front of an audience," he writes.
Instead, it's as terrible as "a convicted man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations are about the old Europe that is falling apart and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has become an economic competition," Englund writes, "a war between the factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the Bestiarium of the still young century": "the word turned and ideologically convinced mass killers in a suit of measure that kills while sitting behind a desk."
People behave unexpectedly and there is just as frivolous behaviour as heroin.
Englund talks about the soldiers who were actively trying to get involved with a prostitute with a sex disease to escape the front service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade with gonococcal eaters, because soldiers bought and made a living on their genitals, hoping to get to the hospital like this," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate put him in the eyes, which led them to be blind for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund's poetry is supple and yet inexcusable and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes he captures the way the war "unleashed uncontrollable forces in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about the First World War were usually more falsified like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarques "Nothing New" than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional hall of glory.
His book has the most devastating end of which I have ever read in a book.
I'm not giving it to you anymore.
But it's like he took this page from us with his book, with the main characters in his nose and lit it with a match.
After an early failure a minutiously planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved in some of them carrying military helmets.
They had chosen the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at that time there are hardly any people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret, and only a few high-level officials were informed, and all the others initially believed that they would take part in an exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was in the middle of them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of the past few weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which is contrary to the rules of the Decerrat and has given the housekeepers an enormous increase in public sympathies, were no longer allowed to repeat themselves.
And so the police action was carried out to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by observing how the occupation was carried out in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randall's Island.
Officials strengthened the so-called chaos training - measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid transfer of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit was held on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came "at the last minute," said someone who is familiar with the orders, which spoke for a declaration as "exercise."
"The few police officers that were involved in my knowledge did not know that it was about Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to stay anonymous.
"The only people who knew it was about Zuccotti Park were the senior officials of the department."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to clear the park, but then they moved back when hundreds of protesters came together after they had learned about these plans.
Officials from various police units were involved in the operation of Tuesday, including mission commandos from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials who are usually used in high-level criminal neighbourhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that in the course of the day, many people in and out of the park, almost like Pendler, so that 1 o'clock in the night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the lowest number of people in the park is in the park," he said.
Aerial cars with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were ready for departure at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-recorded news that weaned from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When the public officials ended up in their light blue wind jackets in the park, many of the protesters just cleaned up their things and left the place.
The police said that until 1: 45 no tents would be touched to give the protesters time to pack their goods together.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area to intervene if arrests in the park were to be necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman of the police president, said that this had been done to their own safety.
But many journalists say that they wanted to stop them from watching the police actions in the park, and they said that the handling of the officials was very rough.
Mr. Browne said that TV cars on Church Street could have taken photos on the west side of the park.
When the police moved to the west through the great mess of personal things of the protesters, including suitcases, artificial grass and bags with clothes, followed their staff of the city cleaning, which had been left behind.
Some of the protesters who refused to go were dragged out. Pictures of this appeared on the Internet a short time later.
A main core of the protesters was located near the kitchen area of the camp in the centre of the park.
Some created barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp joined their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Civil protection officials were called to cut them off.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were made in the park until about 3: 30.
The clearance was completed after 75 minutes, according to the police.
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests, as he said, were due to "improper use and resistance to arrest."
The most prominent local official was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed official in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the police department, was also there.
Despite his presence, "Mr. Kelly" did not "manage the operation," as Mr Browne said.
In case they were to access, a second group of officials were waiting on the eastern side of the Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
On Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block further south, barricades were built.
It was possible to observe how from these locations the police extended the area around Zuccotti Park.
In one place was observed as several officials, many of them with protective signs, drove people out.
About 28 people were in the northern area.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At about 5 o'clock a protest man jumped on the roof of a police vehicle and other protesters let the air out of the ripening of a police bus.
In one place the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an official and a protester came to the hospital.
The union of the carers will file an action against the city for redundancies
The union, which represents hundreds of school carers who have lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, as the redundancies were not necessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate influence on the schools that teach poor students.
The action is probably the last option that the union, District Council 37, is still open in its efforts to reverse the redundancies.
Sixty-six school workers, care coordinators and other staff who were among the worst-paid employees in the city and who lost their work on 7 October, described the trade union leader as a political revenge for refusing access to a health fund that the working groups had maintained to close the budget gap last year.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the city council, Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, said last month that the redundancies were part of the budget that was adopted in June.
A member of the city council shot back and told him that in the budget nothing specified that staff would be released from the school aid.
City council officials 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education against a lawsuit. On Wednesday there will be a press conference to formally announce the submission of the action to the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will lead Mr. Walcott and the city's Ministry of Education as a defendant and count eight dismissed workers as applicants, all of which are colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesperson of the city's Ministry of Justice, said that the city was not present with the lawsuit and therefore their individual claims could not be commented on.
According to a draft action submitted by the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of redundancies at the schools in the arteries of the city in order to support an action for unequal treatment, claiming that poor schools have lost more helpers because they are chronically underfinanced.
It explains that while there were no redundancies on Staten Island and only a few redundancies in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school helpers in the District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, lost and 46 helpers in the District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx were released.
By establishing the loss of five out of eight school assistants who were employed in public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the complaint states: "This is not a neighborhood of well-known parents who can organize donations to catch budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was reduced by 3.26% this year. Moreover, funds were lost when the city changed its calculation method for extra financing for each school entry.
The union also complains that the leaders of the high schools were misled by the language in a memo that approved the release of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even if "excess" in the US usually describes the change of a teacher from the salary list of a school to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six maintenance coordinators have been released, not transferred," says the draft action.
Mission completed, Congress ready to agree on Libya
In the end, it looks like Republicans and Democrats are already in Washington to agree on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was necessary was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of the American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate's Committee on International Relations will adopt a resolution under the chairperson John Kerry (Massachusetts), together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and the American troops for their "courage."
"This resolution honors the brave people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country," said Kerry.
"It is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing was easy in the Libya debate.
This summer, legislators from both parties and the White House were arguing about the choice of a number of resolutions to approve or disapprove of the role of the US military in NATO's Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution that approved the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a wide range of parties and there was no vote.
But on the same day this law was passed in the Senate. In addition, the board overcame a decision to reduce the funds for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the US mission became a kind of legislative purgatory - with a Congress that, although it was enough to criticise Obama's approach within the framework of the mission, it was not angry enough to finally pull the ground under his feet.
Then the indecision of the Congress was overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell under the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya on their enormous courage and their extraordinary endurance in their self-liberation" and "praises the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners who support the military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in the successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to democracy."
Will the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Relations Committee or will they divide the legislators, as the June Act did?
The last version is based on the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the Committee's top Republican.
Lugar's speaker said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional change that calls for a balanced budget to be a top priority in almost every Republican and some democrats' congressional period.
The measures under the leadership of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change in the budget or other area to come to the vote at the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far tried to put their amendments to the vote without success, even though they have tried it often enough.
Goodlate change is only one of 68 constitutional changes that have been presented to this Congress and include a whole range of issues.
Some are double - the same law has been presented to both the Congress and the Senate - others are only slightly different.
There are at least 15 versions of the balance sheet change and another dozen in the Senate alone, which would "control federal expenditure."
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients - especially beginners among the Republicans who want to polish their CV - the opportunity to brag that they have "written" such a measure.
The Budgetary Control Act, adopted in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on a change in budget compensation.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that may be put forward by members of the Congress, while the Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to remove the limitation to two term of office of the President.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of changes that guarantee, among other things, the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits marriage under the same sex is, as is a change that prohibits the burning of flags, an ever-recurring proposal.
Some legislators also want to allow the abolition of federal laws if two-thirds of the states refuse to do so.
As eager as Members are proposing changes, they are moving more quickly than they have been in recent years.
In the 11th Congress, the legislators presented 77 such changes, in the 110th Congress, 66th
The pace is fading compared to that of the early 1990s, where members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27. - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Killed but not defeated," says Gifford in the first TV interview after the assassination
Ten months after an armed man had shot her at an election event in Tucson, the Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) performed on national television on Monday night. She sang alone to the Broadway play "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover was greater than that to return to Congress.
When she and Diane Sawyer appeared in the ABC news "20 / 20," she ran for words and needed help walking.
The mission showed the severe slow recovery from the damage that the ball that has been dividing its skull has pierced the left side of its brain and has crossed its head from front to back.
Three months ago, she was surprised to return to Congress to give her voice to the debt brake.
In her first TV interview after the January attack, where six people were killed and 13 were injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult."
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) answered: "Very good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20 / 20" special, which was recorded shortly before the publication of the new book of the couple: "Gabby: A story about courage and hope."
The special has been following Gifford's recovery since the 8 January assassination.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks, you can see them in the hospital bed, with a bald shaved head and a long scarf over your forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to.
Months later, Gifford's sitting in a wheelchair, while therapists show her how to do simple movements.
A nod with your head.
A twinkle with the lips.
And then, their first words, "What."
After a few days, Gifford whispers another word: "toast." She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos that are played in the ABC show show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: you can see the congressmen sing with the therapists on Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Hanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin '.
In an interview with Sawyer, Gifford, who spends two hours daily with therapy, said that she can't remember the day of the murder.
Her husband said that on March 12, he had read an article of a daily about the assassination when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people who were killed during the murder.
The alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner is in a prison in Missouri and is being treated medically while he is waiting for his trial.
"Many people have died," said Gifford's Sawyer.
"Heart, heart, heart."
In the course of his wife's recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, "I was hit."
"So, I'd say," Gabby, you weren't defeated, "said Kelly.
You were just hit.
And you will get through this and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever before.
Troops feel more pity than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
A hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black smokings got up and applauded.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring campaign.
A senior military officer on the Gala, who was observed, among other things, by the Chief of Staff and then Chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, really, it was pity.
The massive contradictory impressions illustrate the heavy relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admirable American public.
The troops will be overhauled with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, say the servants.
The public is increasingly acting as if it were suffering people in uniform.
"We were not victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way to support is to push us into the role of unhappy souls."
The subject is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger that the returning troops have encountered in recent years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, talks are held about pity in the breastfeeding and private between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, Colonel A.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of reverence, as they had defeated rebels and travelled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a "angry, violent veteran was hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and took over a high-level state post in Washington after his return.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the interrogators were subtly asking if he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
"When you talk about your service, you have to keep the negative impressions against it," Cancian explained to his sons.
The lack of ease of the military is partly rooted in the lack of interest of the Americans in the war.
A country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is rarely taken out as a praise.
"We as a nation no longer appreciate military heroism as it was absolutely common in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the suffering of a member of the service.
Armed forces are recognised for the number of attacks they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost or for the severity of their injuries.
The military is facing the growing pressure to get through hard when raping
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men will be charged with non-intervention in a rape before the military court.
If this does not happen, hundreds of applicants will be available for the next hearing.
She was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week when she was raped by a soldier colleague at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who carried a 12-pack of beer.
He asked her if he could bring her to her room for a drink.
"My alarm bells went on," said Lyman.
But the Texan was out of her mind.
I thought, "Oh, what, he's 19.
He's from Texas, "she said.
"I wish I had listened to my gut."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man stepped behind them, pushed them down and raped them, she claims.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military agencies are waiting for a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which it is decided whether a lawsuit that they have brought against former Minister of Defence Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, is to be brought to justice.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld did not oppose the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February, by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the action initially included 17 applicants, who increased to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men who all claim that they were raped or sexually abused by soldiers, and that the military failed to identify, condemn or provide an appropriate case-law according to the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's on top of the military leadership because the problem is starting there.
"The military is built here," she says.
"Who are the individual people who are in the position to exterminate the culture's retribution? The leadership."
Burke also says that since February she has contacted almost 400 other survivors, many of them may be part of future complaints.
Their strategy: Instead of all the applicants putting their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, file many more complaints to maintain the pressure.
The defence team for the Ministry of Defence, led by Federal Prosecutor Neil MacBride, has submitted a request to reject an action.
The files of the court, which are available to Newsweek, detail the defence strategy, in particular that the military cannot be charged by current or previous soldiers for injuries to which it has come into the armed forces.
According to a law of the Supreme Court of 1950, the so-called Feres-Doctrine, the government is not liable for any injury to the soldiers in active service.
"The alleged damage was caused during the military service of the applicants," says the document.
The Ministry of Defense refuses to comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to work in the fight, the distinction is only in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, especially in contact with local women in the war areas.
The result: between these two wars 150 soldiers died, two thirds of them in battle.
It's time for the military to be modernized, says Burke.
And she is not alone in her fight: three more charges are pending except for her.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four most important military academies for the alleged promotion of a anti-women's atmosphere.
The non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America is, independently, collecting a lawsuit against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder," who received rape victims to release them from the service - a common approach according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group filed a complaint against the veteran administration (i.e. the administration of war veterans) in which she accused her discriminatory practices in handling the rights of persons who have stated that they had been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were presented to Congress independently of each other by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties, which offer a number of points of reference.
In 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (i.e.: Office for Prevention and Reporting of Sexual Abuse) of the Ministry of Defense, 3.158 sexual abuse was reported.
However, most of the abuses are not reported at all and according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure takes into account about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occur per year.
The report, published in March, also examines the law enforcement rates: in 2010, 20% of the cases were brought to justice in the military, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the robbery.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape of a whole series of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing, she was asked about the sex she had before the assault with her friend.
Six people testified as character witnesses in the name of the alleged offender who was finally acquitted.
"I remember well the day the judgment was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the labor was going to work. I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They took me to the psychiatric department, and I remember when I came out, I said to my commander," This wasn't his procedure. "That was my procedure."
Lyman was asked to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her incapable of service.
In January 2010, she was dishonorably released, so that she did not receive any support.
Whether the action brought by Lyman and the other applicants is progressing is pure speculation, says John Turley, Professor of Law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes: "I think they should move forward."
What stands between them and a judgment is this doctrine, which has been criticised since it was first put into question.
I'm a contemporary critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military is a decade behind, because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrence that a liability entails.
He adds, "The odds are against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change if good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow her path, Burke, the applicant's lawyer, will start with her hundreds of other applicants for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this respect until reforms are made," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers watch you on Facebook
Before he became a new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who has confessed to having committed an ammo in Norway in July, where 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time before his attack in front of his computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on the sides of social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
This is easy - you only have to log in on Facebook.
"We have noted that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report by the British idea factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebooks hiding personal data is so encyclopaedic, Bartlett says that the researchers simply have to use the advertising tool of the site to determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - just as the marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of the extreme right across Europe and then visited them with Adds, but instead of being linked to a new band or a new diet product, the Adds invited users to a survey asking for their educational status, their attitude to violence and the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question more than 10,000 supporters of 14 very right parties in 11 European countries - without even having to leave their office once.
"It's a rather new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online supporters of the right-wing extreme groups are usually young, male and are angry about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screens."
DEMOS's work is just an example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything, from health issues to social trends such as "Like," text news and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, who add on average three content per day, Facebook's "Data Supernova" generates a research boom that has allowed the number of scientific works called this page to increase by almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that through this page you can study people who are not usually reached with your clipboard on the street.
"If you used to try to question people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first, and it would never have allowed them access," says Bartlett.
"With Facebook, all this falls away - you go straight to them."
Others say that the site offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues, has found that students who discussed their full-time exchange on Facebook are significantly more prone to problem drinking than students who were silent about this issue.
Moreno proposes that equal-level students, for example residential consultants, monitor the site and help a student if they post too many status updates.
"You cannot solve a problem if you have not recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who would otherwise not have been found."
Facebook is also constantly tapping into the data of its own population.
The data team of the page has produced statistics on the status of relations and Valentine's Day, election participation in the 2010 intermediate elections and a national lucky index (with the main use of data to which only Facebook has access - masters of digital freedom have long known that the site should make its large data collection available for research purposes for others).
But Facebook's users know that the site is watching them whether they want to or not. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, it is possible to show the site its own personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know anything about?
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think many users have ever thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, on a 2006 study in which he studied the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As for her, it was only about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the information is true in a user profile and in contributions.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research has to take care of social research - and a lot of social life still takes place offline."
"Cold and inhumane": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to two amuses that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself in his first appearance in a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple knight of Norway," he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organisations that support hassideologies and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the laws, but I do not confess guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, as he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to speak to Breivik, who had a prewritten speech, to speak to his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the police keep Breivik in custody for 12 more weeks, that he has four weeks of no access to the media. He said that the authorities will control all visits and the entire correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and members of the victims took part in the hearing.
Some came in the hope of seeing Breivik in the eyes, others wanted to confirm that he was behind lock and bar.
Everyone took part with the aim that everything would go to a close.
"I thought he seemed cold and inhumane," a survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian station NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a little further after I saw the suspect and heard him."
Breivik was wearing a dark suit and a blue tie and seemed quiet and professional throughout the hearing. He looked journalists and survivors in the eyes when he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's bizarre indication that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had any accomplices.
Some may like that the attacks of July 22 were apparently the work of a single extremist and not of a group of radicals.
But does that automatically facilitate the grief and confusion that a whole nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," said a victim's relative.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 lessons of the interview with the late Steve Jobs that was shown this week in a theatre
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the technical genius as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans may find most obvious in the recently rediscovered job interview, which was dusted this week before special film shows on the important markets, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and work processes.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and a self-appointed hippie, but he was also an acrib organizer who made a lot of diagrams - a man who believed that many managers were suffering from "a disease of thinking," "that a really great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Fashions" about the break-up of the personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with jobs in which they had one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At that time, ten years had passed since jobs had been pushed out of Apple, and he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was looking forward to the wide acceptance of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in fascists, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing during delivery.
It was only after Job's death that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly revised film material is the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview," which comes to the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to hate detailed interviews, jobs here seem surprisingly eager to explain their technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, there are four longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, in which jobs clearly weigh their thoughts and seek accuracy.
There are also moments when jobs' perfectionism comes to light when he is apparently impatient in responding to Cringey's questions and pushes him to respond more quickly to issues or side-actions of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone recorded, the lost interview seems kind of uncanny wide-ranging when jobs assess what other companies do right or wrong in their opinion and represent their own vision of the future of the computer.
It is one thing to read posthume valuations of the career jobs'. But to see jobs here as the greedy dreamer who is on the leap to greatness is something completely different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he did all this, he left and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interview:
How he learned to run a company:
"All the years in business, I always ask," Why do you do things? "And the answer you always get is," Oh, that's how it's done. "
No one knows why he's doing what he's doing. No one in the business is really thinking about things.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues to make efforts to rationalise Apple's accounting.
Blossoms how costs were recorded - most of the time they started with "standard costs," which were measured on a mere basis and then adapted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that made sure that the business costs could be determined to the least.
How the Pope was alarmed:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that could be used to sneak into the phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
A lot has already been written about the device, but job enthusiasm, when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment, is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a charge phone, making a call and then connecting from an AT & T network to another, while slipping as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things around the globe half a dozen times, and when you were grumbling on the phone, it came out a minute later on the phone next door," says Jobs giggling.
"We were young and we learned that we can build something ourselves that can control trillion dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that can control a giant thing, that was an incredible lesson, and I don't think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs continues to talk about a glorious prank, the Wozniak and he almost pulled off when they called in the middle of the night via Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to talk to the Pope while they were so good they could follow Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic Hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two had to laugh off before the Pope himself got on the phone.
How he fell in love with the technology (and called Bill Hewlett unprepared):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he was looking for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, jobs received a part-time job for the summer at Hewlett-Packard.
"This had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at the age and it formed my views about what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever produced."
He was as big as a suitcase, had a little screen with brown tubes and I fell in love with him.
I'd climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on to this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview, jobs talk about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he built up some boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the whole computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think about both the assembly and the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later on with Apple, he remembers the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember striking arguments... you yelled at me that it would take five years to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15, which was incredibly credible.
About large companies that decline:
Long before he had Apple relive, Jobs foresaw the ways in which so many industrial giants with their visions got into stumps and lost control of their shares.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so make a better copy or printer, so what?"
They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [they are] people who ultimately lead the companies and the product with which people are pushed out of decision making.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly position is being eradicated by the people who have no concept of good products vs. bad products - craft art.
This happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the whole computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger if the Microsoft of the 1990s had been...
You got the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There's a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about your subtleties.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5,000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
In the end, it comes down to the taste, it comes down to trying to deal with the best stuff that people have created and then trying to bring these things together to what they do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, steal great artists.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who worked there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it were not for the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas are having dinner with opponents of health laws, as court accepts case
The day the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the political-sharing question of whether to listen to a challenge to the health laws of President Obama, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner sponsored by the firm to represent the case in court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met for a meeting to discuss the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a complaint that 26 states have raised against the far-reaching reform of the health system, which was decided by Congress last year, a law that became the headline of the conservative activists all over the US.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5-1 / 2-hour basic discussion is expected in March, which is likely to stimulate the outcome of the 2012 presidential campaign, which will be in full swing at the time the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who is in court and will claim that the law is to be rejected will probably be Paul Clement, once a general prosecutor under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the almost two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federalist society, an old-fashioned group dedicated to the defence of conservative principles of law.
Another company that sponsors dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the economic associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which are fighting the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., who is financially involved in the outcome of the process.
Dinner was held in a Washington hotel a few hours after the court had discussed the case.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, the head of the Republican group in the Senate and an declared opponent of health reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been visiting events of federalist society for years.
And that does not violate moral rules.
Indeed, judges are free from the code of conduct that regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the Code, which says: "A judge may participate in benefit events of close-to-law and other organisations, with the judge not being a speaker, guest of honor or, according to the programme, a guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the firms related to the case and to a company with a massive financial interest in it was enough to alert moral and government activists.
"This amazing break with morality and the contrast to the code is a lie of the charges of some judges, the court is following the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dined at the court during a notification event with lawyers with floating proceedings."
Their appearance and support for a donation action for this event undermine any right to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little respect for critics who say that they would be too easily mixed up with groups that can be guided from the agenda, such as Federalist society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives claim that it is judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general state attorney under the Obama government when the first legal arguments came to court at first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw himself from the hearing of the case because of premonition, because she was too committed to defending the law in order to be unbiased.
Kagan doesn't make any institutions to do this.
Boeing draws record order of 18 trillion dollars on land
The airline Emirate orders 50 two-way Boeing 777 aircraft with one option on 20 more aircraft.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It is really a rare news that a company is getting a contract over 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft in total is at a record total of 18 trillion dollars.
The client of Boeing is also unusual: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that in the next 20 years, airlines from the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 trillion dollars.
On the weekend, Boeing announced its largest contract of all time for commercial aircraft, measured by the value of the order: 50 double-track Boeing 777 jets.
The Hammer order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
The airline also announced, as Boeing announced at the Dubai Aviation Show in 2011, an option to purchase 20 more aircraft that will increase the total list price to 26 trillion dollars.
On Monday, the Boeing Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improved the fuel consumption and the comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Morningstar's stock exchange expert.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by the oil-producing countries.
So not only do they have the money to pay for the aircraft, but an increase in oil prices, which is usually harmful to airlines, as this is one of their greatest cost points, is not so harmful as the country deserves a higher oil price.
This is important as they tend less than other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders when oil prices rise, said Dihora.
"You have a natural security," he said.
The order of Emirates confirms Boeeng's leadership position on the market for large-scale aircraft and helps to keep the Airbus competitor SAS in check, which is attacking the dominant position with the A350.
Boeeng's victory on the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced that you would postpone the introduction of the largest A350, which is directly competing with the 777-300ER.
You moved the introduction to gain more confidence after customers had called for a higher payload and range.
The Boeing shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican President loses apparently election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug dealer has supported Fausto Vallejo from the PRI in the race for the governor's post.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon apparently lost her application for the office of Governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections, claiming on Monday that drug dealers had affected the race for one of their opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo has won the race for the Western government's government in the institutional party of the revolution, the PRI.
"The intervention of organised crime throughout the electoral process, and especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls... they occupied election cabins, built up road blocks... and asked people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled seven decades in Mexico until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are seeking a return and victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have just hit Claderon, who had led in the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of the conservative party Acción Nacional PAN of her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the currently in office governor, came to number three, a severe defeat for the split and blatant left-wing leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the provisional results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies links with drug dealers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels that specialize in marijuana, heroin and amphetamine.
It is President Calderon's home country and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still going on.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and many candidates have gone out of the local elections because of fear.
For the PRI a victory strengthens the party, no matter how resentful the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who will probably represent the PRI in the race around the presidential office is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think that this victory will make us look brave next year."
ADB urges Asia to help save the euro area
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the euro area's recovery in its severe debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of Asia's economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the ADB based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economic nations in the world must do "everything in your power" to speed up the recovery of the currency block either by the International Monetary Fund or by direct mutual agreements.
He warned the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), who are "passionate" about the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of European leadership and European resources by Asia helps to prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis," he said to the Financial Times in an interview on the edge of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is not immune."
"So if China and India can help, then by all means."
Europe's monetary union has been in a serious debt crisis in recent months.
Over the past few days, Italy's interest costs have increased dangerously and the Prime Ministers have resigned from both Italy and Greece.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe raises fears that the global economy could fall into the recession and led to calls for the leading emerging countries to meet to support the euro area.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from the IMF would be channeled, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of EU rescue fund bonds, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - would provide greater negotiating power for European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Trade, said that "India will do everything in its power to help the euro area," as its own economy now suffers from the falling exports and the drying-out of foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We face major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It is not an option, it is an order, because where else we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no reason to help the rich Europeans if they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at the American Brown University, said that it would be very difficult to sell to the 1.2 trillion people in India help for Europe, of which more than 800 million are living in 2 dollars or even less a day.
"At some point they will find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and spend holidays on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India's reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid public service employees in Greece, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-taking facilities such as the railway.
Mr Nag said that the crises in the euro area will have "significant dominant effects" on the whole of Asia.
The forecast of the ADB with an economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for the years 2011 / now threatens "the risk of downgrading" due to the threat of European risk.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets would have to create "crisis plans" to protect themselves for a downward trend and a significant capital drain of their words.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible incisions in the defence system
Defence Minister Leon Panetta welcomed the Congress on Monday, when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security unnoticed, thereby triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon halls to the war scenes in Afghanistan and the civilian flow bands.
The Pentagon is already thinking of cuts of 450 trillion dollars in the course of the coming decade, but now fears that further cuts of 600 trillion dollars or more will be necessary if Congress cannot reach a final in the expenditure.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the Ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of the Congress to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to so-called seizure, would lead to 23% general cuts and a stop to many new projects.
"Such a high reduction, carried out in such an unthinkable way, would make most of our ship and construction projects impossible - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and would seriously harm other modernisation efforts," Panetta wrote to the Senators.
"We would also be forced to unwillingly separate ourselves from a large part of our civilian staff and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians with a certain degree of certainty in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our preparedness for alarm."
The cuts were finally met with the fighting forces, "said Panetta.
"While the war-time quotas in the anti-terrorism fight are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect the war efforts," Panetta warned.
"Staff recruitment has been reduced, which would lead to delays in the recruitment and recruitment supervision that support the war."
"Staff salaries would be reduced, leading to late payments to war time dealers and legal and political support would be disturbed."
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details on the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of the seizure of the Ministry of Defence would lead to a rapid decline in the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are vehemently against this draconian act," said the Senators in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result that we cannot live with, and it is certainly not one that should be imposed on us."
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and their entry should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta's letter and the new warnings from the senators will increase the pressure for a compromise in the budget or increase demands to exclude the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has increasingly expressed the possible cuts, although he has been able to gain many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence painted a dark picture of what might be ahead - a military with a shell, but without a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It is an air-weapon squadron without sufficiently trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers who are able to carry out the mission," said Panetta in his opening speech in the Pentagon.
"It is a force that lacks morality and security and is unable to accept it with potential opponents."
"She actually makes you get angry."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta introduced new details, such as "reductions create significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global commitment and intervention, leading to unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects could fall victim to the deletion, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground camp vehicle, the Army and the Navy need to replace the Humvee.
If you stopped the F35's further development and tests, this would save up to 80 trillion dollars over the next 10 years, but the supporters say it's an important next step to upgrade, so that possible threats can be banished by China and other opponents.
How to expose a lie
A look at the current headlines shows how worrying and widespread deception and lie are in daily life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is in the process of becoming the leader of the accusations of sexual harassment by several women.
The management of Penn State is accused of perjury, as it is claimed that reports have been withheld that a retired football coach has sexually abused boy.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy claimed to American President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself when he put in circulation denials that were quickly repugned by inexcusable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of the violations of campaign financing related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one will forget about the media circus that President Bill Clinton launched when he lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in office.
Stories of school-school and college-school slamming are widespread.
There have been incidents in which teachers have given their students the examination answers so that they themselves have been good at their performance checks.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and smiles are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
As studies prove, we lie every day between 10 and 200 times.
Many of these lies, however, are considered to be an emergency lie.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing lies or "uncovering lies" is one that is important for every person to learn, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game such as charades, in which the aim is to call "Have You!," the uncovering of a deception is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that have carried out far-reaching research projects, especially in the areas of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most of the old myths were exposed to lies.
Lies look into your eyes.
They don't always stutter, stem, rot, and saddle.
It must not be concluded, however, that these liars are difficult to detect and to expose.
A trained liar can penetrate the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, the fine facial expressions, the question and timing.
I have spent several years studying the scientific results of the comprehensive and constantly growing field of deforestation, and it is clear that the uncovering of a deception is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us to be able to manage in our complex world, especially if the recruitment or questioning of persons or negotiations or administration is one of our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at assessing other people, their interest and their own emotions, and they feel intuitively how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverted people are more often lying than introverted people, that men are more often "self-oriented" lies than women whose lies are more "oriented" to others - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people are less often lying to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are usually "fat lies").
We also know that when one person was deposed as a criminal, others felt less guilty of lying to that person.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First of all, by watching the normal behavior of this person.
That's called "baselining," the starting position.
It provides a reference point for the subsequent assessment of changes.
Watch the attitude, the laughter, the voice quality of your subjects.
You should know better when someone usually trippes with their foot, so they don't accuse him unjustly when they trippin 'with their foot during a meeting.
Then take care of the inoculation of obvious verbal and non-verbal behaviour.
Consider these concoctions as an alarm bells that are screaming, not as evidence of a detox.
People who are deceiving may be staring when they try to remember their story. Maybe their feet point towards the door or they lie towards the exit, change their position in a significant way or show a "relaxation after the recruitment conversation," this deep, relaxing exhalation and the change in attitude when all the hard questions are over.
Questions often falsely indicate that an recruitment call is over, just to look for this relaxation after the recruitment call.
Also take care of the language of your subjects.
Scott Peterson's slider is famous when he used the past form when he claimed his wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deepening people can also use a distancing language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a tricky question in general.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualified language" when they answer a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth... as far as I'm aware... according to the best knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer more perceptive than factual, which often frightens the alarm bells.
There is no magic to uncover lies, but you can learn skills thanks to which a uncovering is possible.
Thanks to these skills, anyone can become the victim of fraud in both private and professional life.
A controversial plan of an oil pipeline is revised after threat by delayed US approval
A few days after the Obama government has threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, which has upset the trade unions and at the same time calmed the environment, the company building the pipeline is trying to replan the project so that you can return to normality.
On Monday evening, TransCanada said that the planned pipeline will be redirected from the environmentally sensitive area of the sand hills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the parliament building in Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the company is still confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, although with a different course.
This was followed by an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision on a federal authorisation for the project would be postponed until the new possible course of action was reviewed, which would avoid the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered may delay a decision until 2013, after the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama stated in a written statement last week that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and agreed to its support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was connected to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from Alberta Province to the refineries in Texas.
To this end, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
They hate environmentalists, but they love labour markets, because they appreciate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But the legislators of Nebraska, who are against the plan, weigh the laws to force a return from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the influence on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project has little influence on the environment, but the source of the energy economy says that the Ministry's principal auditor has requested a separate probe of the review procedure, which focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist who was hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a consultant to Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice because it is in contact with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused because she allegedly forced a child to vomit for fear
A New York family claims that the Disco-Diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building would have had a toboggan attack that would have put her little daughter in fear of being afraid.
The tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she was suffering from "personality changes, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on November 10 last year, when the stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a child's gardener, and Genevieve wanted to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk got the car, Roseanna Monk went to the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard with his luggage and Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped her daughter off for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said," Do you know what your daughter is doing? "I said," Yes, "and went to take her back on her arm," she said.
LaBelle was angry at the pregnant woman.
"She said in an aggressive tone," You should not drop your daughter near the door, "said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her," I don't care what you say or think. "
She got angry and started to scream - she used the F-word and the A-word and got very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and she started to throw water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had become hysterical.
"I said to this woman," Look what you did to my daughter, "said the child's mother.
LaBelle fell on the mother, who was still wearing Genevieve on her arm, and had to be held back from her companion and moved to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby screamed so much that it had to turn itself in, she said.
Later the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but did not receive an answer.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not reply to calls asking for an opinion.
The lawsuit is for an unspecified compensation, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he won't charge a fee and plan the family, the money they get, the child cancer aid.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," said Davis.
"This kind of behaviour is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is brought to the attention of a child-gardener who has an 18-month-old baby on his arm."
Climate distortions have slowed the economy
In the first year in which Mario López Valdez is a government, unemployment and undeclared work increased in Sinaloa, while foreign investment went down and the economy stagnated.
In 2011, the economic history of Sinaloas will remain in mind. It is the first year that Mario López Valdez, who called himself the initiator of change and raised great hopes of economic growth, is the government. However, due to the climatic tides, growth cannot be mentioned, but on the contrary, the main economic indicators have deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February did not only lead to millions of losses in agriculture, but also to close limits on the growth of the state economy and in the first quarter of the year caused a general decline in economic activity by 3.6%. This is mainly due to the historical reduction in agricultural development by 31.16%, which has had a significant impact on other sectors of the economy.
According to a report by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustainable (d. Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the effects of the frost, 582 000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, of which 78.03% were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07% were partly destroyed.
The decline in economic activity up to November has led to a continuous increase in unemployment in the Mexican state. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter of the year, as from January to March, 55 053 inhabitants of Sinaloas had no employment, which is 4.53% of the working population. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate increased to 5.28% and from July to 6.19%, resulting in 74 000 unemployed people in Sinaloa, which is 18 969 people more than in the first quarter.
Reduced liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa in the year is based on several factors. Economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), commented that the policy of the public institutions indirectly explains the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently seeing is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market as a result of the legislation adopted to combat money laundering in Congress, because it is not easy for those who have to accumulate the dollar to make it work for themselves, to invest it or to use it for anything else," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that the growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country in search of work abroad, especially in the United States, has fallen, on the one hand, due to the problems of entry and, on the other hand, because it is difficult to find work there too, and these people are staying here and looking for work, which will increase unemployment," he says.
Black work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious if the high proportion of undeclared work is taken into account, which, according to INEGI, includes 60.38% of those employed in the country who work without paying into the social security funds.
The low wages, the lowest in the whole of Mexico, come from unemployment and undeclared work, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Government Office for Labour and Social Care in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos by September, much less than the general government average, which is 7375 pesos.
Decrease in ADI
In addition to the reduction of economic activity and growing unemployment, the largest fall in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the last ten years is recorded in 2011. According to the Secretaría de Economía (State Economic Authority), the ADI was 630 597 dollars from January to June, which corresponds to an 87.74 percent blow compared to the 5 143 312 dollars in the same period of the previous year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Government Authority for Economic Development), in turn, has a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
Debt
In the light of the economic crisis, the national government requested a loan of 3 000 000 million pesos to be invested in the 18 municipalities of the country in July at the National Congress, but no positive effects of the debt on any of the economic sectors in the country were found by November.
Reactions
For the representatives of entrepreneurship, the first year of government Mario López Valdé made it clear that the government was unable to do so.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of the Manufacturing Industry in Mexico) said that no efforts were made in 2011 to harmonise the views of the different sectors, including the national government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor this year. It must be worked hard to regain the terrain lost this year and we must make a double effort in 2012. The efforts of all, and in particular the progress of the well-agreed government team, have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year made the country's economic development difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the most important effects is a slow economy that is not sufficiently moving to create an economic dynamic that could create an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore, we will close the year far below our expectations," he said.
Redefine vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, Chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Mexican business association) in Sinaloa, said that the state must be encouraged to become more dynamic productive.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to redefine the economic vocation and line of the country, because it is important to activate all material and human resources of Sinaloas," he said.
There's a lot to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that would guide the government's efforts in a better way.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current state power had made progress with the government.
"There are areas in which you can say that the government has done more than anything else. What I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg of marijuana
A population of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 daily rates for the possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The State Prosecutor's Office of the Republic announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a public health offence - here the property of Marihuana intended for trade.
In accordance with the Act AP / SIN / CLN / 687 / 2010 / M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on June 7, 2010 by Mexican military in the surveillance of the road Cipriano Valdez against security post No 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white van, in which he kept a black bag in a box in the car and on the passenger seat a small backpack in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were handed over to the judge of the district and the sentence is still in the enforcement centre.
Debt for construction
The social structures for migrants provided for in the Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programmes are at risk of not being completed because of the lack of resources or only with great delay, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The head of the urban social development authority stated that, although the construction programmes have already been advanced, they are now in danger, as the government has not paid the funds to it, which exceed 11 million peso for the three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes was almost 50 million peso, of which 25 percent fell on the state. Until now, only the Federación and the municipality had contributed to the construction work, which is why a delay in the construction process is expected.
"They have to contribute 12 million, and even though the year is already coming to an end, they have not given us a penny, and that, although they had to pay us a part in July," he said. "In order not to be late, we have already started the construction work, and they are already well advanced, but we need the money."
He stressed that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla the state had failed to fulfil its obligations, which is why at the beginning of its reign the municipality had to take up a loan of 7 million, corresponding to the amount that the central government would have had to pay.
"We had already done so in the last legislature, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes continued and this year we had to get the funds that the state had not been able to take part in these programmes," he said.
Although the public authorities were obliged to pay these funds, he commented that the Minister for Administration and Finance, was requested to speed up administrative work and to pay out the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"They have to contribute almost 12 million, and even though the year is already ending, they have not given us a penny."
The court approves the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The change of analogue to digital signals has been one of the most important changes in the world over the past few years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the Constitutional Complaints filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Decree, which required the transfer of analogue to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes required to fight the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his powers when he issued the legislative decree with the details of the switch to terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate, as it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes in order to allow the court to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality, so the law remains in force.
The project for the action prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero proposed to declare the Legislative Decree unconstitutional, since the regulations relating to radio and television are the responsibility of the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico), which is why the Legislative Decree would be contrary to the hierarchical principles and the law reserved.
In favour of the project, only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Members filed constitutional complaints against the Legislative Decree. After the adoption of the actions, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Legislative Decree and set up all activities to establish the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the action brought by the Chamber of Members without entering into the debate on the project for which the Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the project's arguments, in the sense that the country government should not regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration by general rules.
"I also do not believe that, if this were to be done, the independence of the regulatory body would be affected." She also recalled that the central government is responsible for planning strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, because it is responsible for public affairs.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have taken place around the world in recent years, and it will make better use of the radio-electric spectrum, increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The postponement of the transition, she said, was a postponement of the benefits of digitisation, which was a decision in the public interest that had not only technical aspects, "because it included economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, they stressed, "made the action of the entire system necessary, in accordance with the principle of economic governance by the State, they included a group of features that put the Constitution in the hands of the central government."
It recalled that many countries around the world had already implemented the digital transition, including the government, although they had highly specialised institutions.
It could not be concluded that the government would intervene in the powers of the Congress with the issue of the contested legislative decree, because the laws adopted by the legislature would be respected, "she assured.
The possibility of counting the ballot papers in Michoacán individually is considered
According to PREP, the difference between first and second place in the election of the governor is just under 27%, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of a single list of voting papers this year is a reality in the elections in Michoacán, because according to the data issued by the Programa de resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second places in the governors' elections is almost 27%, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Elektoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, has reminded that, just last November, the election office had adopted a number of rules for the harmonisation of local rules with the reforms of the states in electoral matters.
It should be recalled that Michoacán had not adapted his political constitution, his electoral law, or his law on electoral justice to the reforms adopted by Congress, so that they had not entered into force in this round of elections. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the Public Prosecutor's Office within the time limits set for it, with the argument that he had no objection to it.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional action brought by the local legislature and considered the voice of the State Commissioner on the constitutional reforms to be "invalid and illegal," as it does not have the right to "decide" or to veto it. "
María de los Ángeles Llanderal, in an interview on the possibility of the individual count of votes, stated that, thanks to the adoption of the directives by the Consejo General del IEM, there is now the possibility that the local electoral authority may count the voting papers in part or in part.
For example, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may not be counted in part. The results in the minutes are not in agreement; the minutes on the count and calculation of votes are not in fact available or it is not in the possession of the chairman of the electoral committee or there are obvious errors or changes in the minutes.
In addition, the total number of the full-completed ballot cards may be given if there is a difference between the alleged winner and the one who is in second place, which is equal or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an express request from the party or coalition chairman, who is the second of the candidates mentioned.
The vote may also be taken as a whole if, after the normal calculation has been completed, it is found that the difference between the expected winner and the candidate in second place is equal or less than one percent, provided that there is an explicit request from a representative of the party whose candidate has become second. In this case, the election packages that have been subject to a partial count would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to PREP, the difference between first and second place is just under 0.16%, although the votes of 129 of a total of 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés have rarely ridden down this Sunday night on Saltillo, his birthplace. On Monday the death show and a death fair took place.
According to the family members, the last will of the chief key was to spread his ashes over the Zapalinamé mountains.
After an honor, the family of Bacio Cortés, together with the others who died in the accident, returned to the capital of Coahuila on a plane of the Mexican Air Force in the Mexican Air Force. The closest people to the colonel took part in the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon the ashes of the chief key landed on the mourning hall, which is located on the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family members and friends came from.
At 5.30 p.m. his remains were examined at the Technical Institute of Saltillo. This was the occasion of this morgue show by his former fellow students from the technical abitur and his American football team, Felipe Bacio, who was a member of the abitur during his preparation for the abitur.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would be spread over the Zapalinamé mountain. He had always said this to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
From her point of view, the lieutenant-in-chief had fulfilled all his dreams and she thought that he had been in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, extraordinary as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to enter the Zapopán Air Force School, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it because they thought it would even be dizzy on a truck. Nevertheless, he always sought to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good person. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and already the whole family wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he had gone to Zapopán to graduate his family member. That's why he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: to fly a plane.
A final farewell
The chief lieutenant of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was approved with all due respect under the direction of the Governor Jorge Torres López. Their honor was given to him by the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force, school leaders and students of the technological education institution of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and found excellent in both studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago, when the helicopter he was flying, in which the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other persons from the same authority were also in a crash.
At 6: 05 p.m. the cremated remains of Bacio Cortés, citizen of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over by the funeral company to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, where he was already expecting his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other members, students and teachers.
The abandoned bodies were found on a plot at the Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the discovery, military members presented to the media 11 people who had been arrested in the same village in connection with organised crime.
Three men were found killed by gunshots in different parts of the body and a grace shot in an abandoned finca in the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event took place at the distance 1.5 km from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
A number of previous speakers saw that the door of the country house surrounded by a beige-brown wall was on the verge of a barrier.
When they looked at the house, they found the bodies of three people within about three metres, which they immediately informed the competent authorities.
One was wearing a yellow T-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; another was lying next to him, clothed with a white top.
The body of another person was just one metre away with red T-shirt and blue pants.
All three were on the stomach.
According to the information received on the site, the three people must have been murdered in another place as no cartridge shells were found.
On the wall of the country house you can read inscriptions that one organized criminal gang writes to another, and several attacks in the wall and the door were found.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (State Secretary for National Defence) presented 11 people, including a minor who were part of a crime course that was mainly active in the village of Cadereyta, associated with kidnappings, murder, halconeo (human hunt) and secret funerals.
According to the public information, eight people were arrested and one prisoner was released in the Los Alveros settlement on November 11.
Three real estate and a cell phone were secured, and the prisoners confirmed that they were members of the criminal group "Los Zetas."
On November 12, at 6: 00 p.m., the military found a car with two occupants on their watch in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
During the inspection of the car, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later on November 13 at 2: 00, one of their accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to escape at the sight of the military.
They are enlisted in the places of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday the formation of the new Italian government
The Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present to him the new government which is to face the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present to him the new government which is to face the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A communication from the Presidential Palace announced that the Monti appointed on Sunday would meet with the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday to confirm government formation.
It is expected that he will present a majority of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will take office.
Monti said he would present to the President the results of the talks with the political parties on government formation.
"I would like to reaffirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to cope with these difficult times," said the former EU Commissioner to the journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm government formation, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "frame is well set now," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of debt to an unbearable level.
The new government, led by former Commissioner Monti, must adopt a hard austerity package called for by the European politicians to regain the confidence that has been expressed in Italy.
The pressure to speed up Monti has been increased by the fluctuating market situation, which has caused the Italian government bonds to be charged with 7% interest for 10 years, in line with the situation in which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European security shield.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Industrial Association Confindustria, informed the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government in every way we could."
We believe that this government is the last chance to get Italy out of this emergency situation.
The success opportunities of Montis were significantly increased by the support of the party PDL of Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are intended to produce good results," said Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the Central Right Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because so far many of its members have expressed their opposition to a majority of the technocrats who are currently forming Monti.
Parliament's support
The new government of Monti needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to his efforts or the delay in the reform could again lead to a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks is also putting pressure on the Italian government to say that a failure of Montis is a disaster.
Monti started his discussions on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business associations as well as youth and women's organisations.
The meeting will be closed on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who, in response to the crisis, has launched an extremely rapid change of government.
After a short breath at the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of the Italian government bonds have again reached critical limits as a result of the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister.
A rescue of Italy with a public debt of EUR 1.8 trillion would be too much for the current EU security shield.
Monti said that his government should last until the next elections, which are expected to take place in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms, rather than prefer the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this should only be made up of technicians, a reference to their concerns in view of the procedure imposed by the pressure of financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties make the involvement of people from political life difficult.
Spaniards have more game issues than the Ticos
Of the 22 players from Spain, ten more than 50 have international games on the boulder.
From the side of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 selected 50 games has been played.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared for the friendship game that is taking place today at 3: 05 in the San José National Stadium.
While the world and European champions, the number one on FIFA's monthly ranking, can look back on a significant number of Class A competitions, the three-color team has only the defense player Michael Umana as the only one with more than 50 international games.
He reached this number last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in the Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players playing in the League de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (Liga and Cup championships) as well as high-level European acupas such as the Champions League.
In addition, the experience with the Spanish Furie comes with complicated extermination games at the Eurocup and the World Cup.
On the other hand, the Tico football players have few international meetings in the context of the Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA ranking.
We will see how the Spanish team draws its last register: the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Saturday against England (defeat 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign games reached a level with the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta.
Casillas will play against the three-color team today and Spain will have a new record of 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hernández, the player of the Barcelona Football Club, has 106.
Last week, Casillas and Xavi even received a recognition from the UEFA, along with others from the Iberian team who had reached the magical number 100: the Zubizarreta quoted with 126 and the middle storm of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number of hundreds is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iiniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are the left side storm Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the stormer Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there, only five games were played: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The one with the least games.
There are less than 30 games in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the national team come on less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even approaching the 20's.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, recorded in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson had not yet had their debut.
The historical goalkeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz shot the most goals with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The Quintet moved Costa Rica into his tour to celebrate its twenty-year-old existence
"To play in Costa Rica is a dream that is realized"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, the bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts on the next Sunday at the national stadium.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assures that they will have a dream when they play in Costa Rica.
The bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva an exclusive interview from Brazil last week.
The band is located in the South American part of their tour to celebrate its twenty-year existence and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On that day they will be performing at the National Stadium from 7.30 p.m. together with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You will read an extract from the conversation, whose full copy can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costarican fans, a dream is realized when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: are you aware of what that means to your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is also realized for us.
This is just the second time we have played in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once. It's such a beautiful country that we'll probably stay there for a few more days.
It's exciting for us to take our music there.
I'm asking you this because the fans of the band are completely gifted. They experience the days before the concert most intensively.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing by our side all these years.
We took almost 21 years to come to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry to have taken so long to come here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn't that a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the most great shows we've had in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played on a few big shows in Sao Paulo and we hope they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we want to play there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are thrilled by the jungle, for which Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you meet Costa Rica and his waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always gone to Costa Rica and Nicaragua to surf. Together with Mexico, the excellent areas are to surf. In this way, we have learned about people who love surfing.
With a view of the tour you have offered huge shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there, we don't have any limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that's partly because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes another song, so the decision we're going to play is not easy.
If we record two or three songs that we haven't played in a while, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs. Otherwise, they could be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us, and I think that's why it's for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your twenty-year history.
When you look back, it is hard for you to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I don't think any of us have ever imagined playing in a great rock band for over 20 years.
We also continue to rely on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like each other and are thrilled to produce music.
We are lucky to be able to go to the places of the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birth of the ground?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of great bands.
We're good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and quite unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Every now and then a band comes out of a city, but it is unusual when five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and we are honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We are looking forward to still being friends with all of them and it is our honor to be part of this coming Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has remained with the same musicians for so long.
Yeah, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) came to us 13 years ago. This alone is a lot more time than many bands survive.
First of all, I believe that we are all happy to be alive and we also care about each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up that give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One of them trusts the other and his music. We could not be better.
Your relationship with glory has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we have grown has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it is too easy to lose this game with huge human masses that love your music.
As long as you think that people have come for the music, that reminds you that you have to respect the music and what it has created without being a famous rock star. We never cared about that anyway.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for three years, which had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have taken so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who built the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I think about what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh together and to talk about music and football and many other issues.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas is responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why the band chose to open it?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and this band was the best we liked. That's why we're curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings him, and I think he sings the first thing he can think of.
Who were you influenced by as a bassist?
Of so many +
One of the first to come up with me is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I can talk about the bassist I like all afternoon.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the ground alive, even though it is no longer a fashion appearance?
I don't think we all feel very connected to the word "grunge."
When I think about it, I think of the bands that I mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I think it's great, because it's worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney make better music now than ever before.
At first her music was darker, now she is more positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that could seem a little light-ready, but there are also other songs like The End or Just Break, which are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive in them.
The two of them came to me when I heard Ed playing them, they're very dark songs.
I think if you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life - for example, if you lose a family member or a friend - it will affect your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly represent this for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori came back to the hospital for medical examinations
The former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, informed his home doctor.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is 25 years in prison for violations of human rights during his reign (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which is four times in operation and controlled.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a member of the Congress and his personal doctor, told the TV that Fujimori would be studied in the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas for three days to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower body members.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons. However, he did not wish to do so because he considered him innocent.
He was operated four times on tongue cancer, and he lost 18 kilos of weight, including other diseases such as severe erotic gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and blood flow problems in the legs, the doctor counted.
Fujimori has been in the department of Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squadron of the Peruvian army, which was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official secondment, led by the Peruvian President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues of the region
Mujica will meet his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón next Wednesday. According to the President of the Republic of Uganda, this will be the highlight of his well-booked schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of the Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," announced the President's Office of the South American country on his website.
According to local media, Mujica is looking for support for the incident with France when the French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still act as tax havens from the international community, which was rejected by Uruguay and asked his ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has been the President of the G20 since November, a group of the most powerful emerging and developed countries in the world. Since January this year, an agreement has been in place on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation with the South American country.
In recent years the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the implementation of agreements on the exchange of tax information in order to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which include countries which have not introduced all international standards on tax cooperation.
A free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay has been in place at the business level since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The mustache-bearing installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been tirelessly fighting for the rescue of Princess Peach from the claudes of evil Bowser for 25 years, but never to date in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he is fighting for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game that comes this month on the trade dikes of all the world has been tailored to the characteristics of the portable console Nindend 3DS, which can be played three-dimensional without special glasses.
"Mario is the figure who has to say how the stereoscopy works without glasses," said Omar Álvarez, who is responsible for the Nintendo-specialized press in Spain when presenting the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo that has been developed for this console from the beginning," because so far, success articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" have been adjustments to existing titles.
The speaker of Nintendo stressed that although it was three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "affordable" video game that allows a fast, liquid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" had two games in one: The first part is "easy" to capture the less-skated users.
After that, the experts can "turn a second round" over the different levels of the game, which are becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, in order to overcome the obstacles without being victims of the "optical effects," it is always necessary to play three-dimensional.
This trip Super Marios to the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo forces the fans of the Saga and repeats the concept of success of the last editions: the mustache-bearing installer must overcome with dangers spilled platforms to free the Princess Peach.
However, the player is confronted with news about the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees the delivery of Portillos to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would grant the extradition of the former governor Alfonso Portillo, who would be responsible in the United States for the conspiracy for money laundering of $70 million.
So the trial ends on the US request for the extradition of Portillo so that it can be brought to justice there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered extradition.
He stressed that during his government he did not interfere in court decisions and that he had accepted all the extradition applications he was informed of.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is delivered for murder and serious assault, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The action of Colombia is a government act that takes place when all judicial and constitutional bodies have been used to condemn the former President of the State (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be delivered when his legal situation in Guatemala is clarified and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for the suppression of 120 million quetzales in the Ministry of Defence during his reign. This trial was preceded by extradition, but the minister objected and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people threatened by social exclusion
The organisation was set up to avoid the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the social assistance organisation Trinijove have produced important results: in this quarter-century, 6000 young people, threatened by social exclusion, were supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, more than one hundred jobs created for this social group are created.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event was held yesterday at the former Fabra i Coats factory buildings, in which more than 300 people took part.
In 1986, Trinijove was set up in the district of Trinitat Vella with the aim of helping young people with low levels of education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
The party in Sant Andreu yesterday took part in many of the responsible institutions and institutions that have worked with the association in these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives from different directions at the time of the election was impartiality in the work carried out by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol took part in the celebrations of the former socialist education minister Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and at the time left-green town council Ricard Goma.
The large room of Fabra i Coats also visited the current Catalan Minister for Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Social Work of the La Caixa savings bank, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was created in very difficult times and that today's times are no less complicated, but he added that the work done so far is "a good basis."
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is a model that is capable of fighting difficult circumstances and giving hope to people in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work he does," he said.
Occupied house in which huge parties were held was cleared
The house owners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on the street Balmes no. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve housekeepers left the building yesterday afternoon without any resistance.
All points out that the nightmares of the neighbors of House No 51 on the street of Balmes have come to an end.
Twelve people volunteered to leave the building, which they held illegally and in which they had organized huge festivals that had led the neighborhood to despair. The clearing took place on a judicial order without police intervention.
After the clearance, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be checked," the house manager confirmed.
The housekeepers, who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the others were inhabited - took the entire electrical system and part of the water supply. They had painted the walls and left all kinds of garbage, especially doses of alcoholic drinks.
In the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days and led the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also had damage to it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, said that her business had fallen by 80% since the start of the house occupation.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the housekeepers made her unfair competition, because they sold the drinks to three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the leisure place had been indicated by the neighbors because of a rest disorder, while according to her statement of noise, it was not from the visitors of the disco, but from the housekeepers, and in particular from the guests of the festivals that were organized there, and which, according to the angry neighbors, have been more and more over the last few weeks.
The director of the discotheque said that the harassment had been so great that it agreed with the owner of the building that it would not have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (city police) also confirmed that in the last few weeks it has received more complaints from its neighbours.
The president of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in the City Council of Barcelona, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had called for the building to be cleared immediately last week and to tackle the problems of civil coexistence and the downfall of the city district.
He explained that before the summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that in the last months, the housekeepers had penetrated into all floors of the building and almost all apartments. In some of them, even theft had occurred.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to take action against the social acts in the building."
Yesterday, another building was cleared by the Catalan police in the Nou Barris district.
At 3: 30 p.m. the police approached the street of Montral No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people trying to enter the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree to the invitation to tender, apart from the arguments about the fees.
The 16-gate urban call opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the peak of the now missing Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its reproach about the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
He was even compared in numbers to the Central Park of New York.
With the fall of the CMB in 1987, the park became the upper limit of Barcelona in the eyes of many, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in the north-south direction, but up (mountains) and down (sea).
The classification of Collserolas as a natural park plays with this idea.
As a model, it was no longer the Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars in the role of the Yogibarian.
So far, when in September the city issued a huge invitation to tender, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access to Collserola.
There is no doubt that a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either that's the case, or someone's planning to put gates on the land.
The question arises by itself: Collserola, park or mountain?
The invitation to tender is not only from an organisational point of view, but also in view of a reflection on the city, the subject of discussion in the mouth of all Barcelona architects.
It is almost a recurrent issue, which two members of this old-fashioned box, who meet in the elevator, can take advantage of.
And this is exactly the fact that the substance offers for one of the rare similarities between what three Barcelona architects think about it and some university professors who have applied to the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The invitation to tender is appropriate.
For Roldán "it is necessary" to talk about the "front of the mountains" after the attack on the coast, as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, who has not been carried out over the green apples, has not been carried out.
"It should be based on the principle that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, he's well-accessible.
Collserola is more complex, "says the architect, for which the title" Gates of Collserola "contains a" lexical trap ": it is not allowed to" imagine itself as access to a park, but as a delimitation of areas in which it is necessary to act. "
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban-building experience, considers the proposal to be an "intellectual challenge," which involves "some dangers."
The "uncertainty" of the design of a public space today is the result of the experience of the 1980s, which had their "swan-singing" in the forum.
The first fear is its own definition of what can be built.
"To limit something always means to set the next step," that is to say, to exceed it.
"You have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the present [referring to the Plan General Metropolitano (PGM)]] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who is closer to the question, means that the side of Collserola, which goes towards Valesana, "can be understood as a park that does not go towards Barcelona," for purely topographic reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola, which should not "come to deaf ears," although he is grateful to the city administration that it has given its body the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment."
He also notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the guide letter, which allows architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "doubts" about whether this technical profile should guide the "exactly the right" multidisciplinary teams (he says) "We architects should be just a tool."
Bayona points out that the answer to the question in the heading of this article is complex, because in the terms of the invitation to tender there is no global view of Collserola: "16 cross-section competitions have been written out," he says, "on the axis of the mountain sea. But there is no longitudinal perspective that looks at the area as a whole."
At least in his case, this has led him to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project would collide with that of the architect of the gate.
In his opinion, the city should ensure that the strip is equipped directly above the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length, so that a soft transition between the city and the green areas is created.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal who is released
After 72 days of silence, the agent of the Casino Red freed the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the trial that is being conducted against him for alleged blackmail.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the agent of Casino Red has given him to the second criminal court of the district, which is leading the trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for extortion.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of the Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás is to be seen, which is likely to force him to pay a sum of money to allow the city administration to approve the secret operation of the competition.
After the indictment, the Public Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal procedure against the brother of the Panist Mayor, who was arrested for 30 days on September 2.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 and Delitos Patrimoniales he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
In this place he remained 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after the official of the Ministerio Público had rejected the crimes for bribery and organised crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta prison because he was supposed to have bribed the owners of the Casino Red with one and a half million pesos. However, he only stayed in the central security line for a few hours, as there were murder threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to take part in the trial as a prisoner of the city prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, he was served by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, who found that after the almost two months of investigation there was sufficient evidence to blame Jonas for the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the court in order to open it in return.
This Monday, the agent of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked the judge José Luis Pecina to give the mayor the sentence, which is why he will be released in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio Público, appointed to the court, asked García Gómez whether he had done the damage and which the owner of the competition had said his forgiveness, but the lawyer held back the name.
In accordance with case 197 / 2011, Jonás Larrazábal is acquitted and no objections to the trial can be made, and no compensation is required.
Larrazabal Bretón was released immediately after the hearing of the contestant at 3.50 p.m..
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to the city prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to tell Jonás that he had been acquitted and that his case would be brought to the files.
He also informed him about the judicial order for immediate release.
The Secretary, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, gives details of the aircraft accident in which the government secretary Francisco Blake and another seven people were killed.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transports - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation on the accident in which the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and another seven people were killed indicate that the helicopter, with its entire undamaged structure, is directly on the ground without the pilot being able to launch an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communication and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the start that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wing had contact with trees at 25 meters high, with the helicopter losing the hull seems to indicate that the helicopter had had had several ground contacts."
He also stated that the helicopter was built for 19 occupants, so he fulfilled all the conditions for the transport of the staff.
He also said that no helicopter parts were found in the field where the machine had come down.
"No aircraft parts were found in other places during the search, the impact on the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 occupants, so it fulfilled all the conditions for the transport of persons.
The area has a slope of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is a priority to get the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but this could take several months, perhaps even a year.
On the other hand, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aircraft and Assistance Services in Mexico) assured that the helicopter from the Estado Mayor Presidencial had flown at a speed of travel and that the plane had fallen on a soft slope.
"This information strengthens the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of impact."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation:
Visibility:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of the vision flight. This means that the team should have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded appropriate weather conditions at the start. During the follow-up to the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico State some deep-hanging clouds arose.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that because of the clouds the team had selected a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca valley.
impact site:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter are in agreement. There may have been no loss of control over the plane or any deviation from the flight route before the impact.
Scatter the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to date indicates that the helicopter was on a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of the spaced aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter had impacted on the ground with its undamaged structure.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft offer at the site of the accident do not indicate either fire or explosion.
The last results of the investigation indicate several ground contacts.
During the on-site investigations, aircraft parts were found at a height of 9200 feet above sea level. The site is shredded and has a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably broke.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had several ground contacts.
After a minute search in an area that went beyond the restricted area at the site of the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft could be found, which increases the assumption that the unsevered aircraft structure had been popped against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to find the gene for obesity
The Social Insurance Institute of Mexico is the head of a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and young people, which is supported by specialists from the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Institute of Mexico) announced that it is leading a research project to discover the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth," with which the genetic markers are to be found in conjunction with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, said that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, food specialists and social workers was established.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate course at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinistav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested parties can come to the sports sites of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where tests with children and young people are carried out every Saturday from 8: 00.
He stressed that the investigation began at the sports field of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of México) and was continued in the sports field of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México) since October 8.
When the target of 500 to 600 people is reached, the study will be continued at the sports field of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and completed on the site of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He said that the aim of the study was to identify the factors and the role of genetics in the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and young people to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the global day of diabetes, he said that three thousand children and adolescents aged six to 14 should be able to fill out food-related questionnaires with the consent and supervision of their parents.
They are also asked questions about their physical activity and their family disease in order to control risk factors that could lead to diabetes or renal failure.
It also stated that on the above-mentioned Saturdays, the test subjects (weight, size, waist size) were measured, their blood pressure controlled and blood levels such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (an attempt to identify genes related to child obesity) were determined.
Cruz López stressed that this study would be carried out in the light of the concern of health care staff about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in almost six years the proportion of fat-bearing boys had increased by 77% and that of girls with obesity by 47 percent. The overweight had also increased dramatically," said IMSS's specialist.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the people of Mexico was different from that of other peoples.
He stated that an average Mexican was 65% Indian-American, 30% European and 5% African, which was reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
In general, he said that the genetics of obesity are expressed in the inability to burn the surplus of the energy (calories) taken from us, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the study participants was a comprehensive study of the children in which it was found whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even investigate the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and the inner arm (akanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes at the pre-stage.
All information would be treated confidentially and informed to the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain to the parents all the results of the measurements and propose to them changes in the lifestyle that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three basic factors responsible for obesity, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of movement, that is, lack of movement in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transport, instead of walking short ways.
The high calorie intake, that is, an increased consumption of sugar and carbohydrates (Tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.), together with a high fat and protein intake and the genetics to be analysed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents flyholes
Rafael Herrera, researchers at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University of UNAM developed with polymers modified asphalt to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the signs from the street cover were to be taken into account, it would not be necessary to repair almost 200 000 potholes at the University of UNAM when the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (the city area of the valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ), warned and assured that if the laying and maintenance of the asphalt lay would be appropriate, the number of potholes would be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Slaughholes from a technical point of view," which he held on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible, with polymers, developed modified asphalt levels to produce a mixture similar to asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climate, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behaviour of the road laying, thus avoiding the occurrence of potholes.
He explained that the asphalt - the most severe part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon compound, of which one part has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalt - and the other part a low - the so-called malthene. Together, they give the road surface its characteristic numerically-sensitive behaviour.
The tensile behaviour of the asphalt content means that it acts like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180 ° C, at 120 ° C it is very tapered and almost solid at 50 ° C, while at very low temperatures it becomes fragile.
"This means that the resistance of asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in one day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer explained.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City had a majority of flexible road traffic, which was made up of six layers of material, of which the last three were asphalt.
Between the top layers lies a wear layer of asphalt, which consists of small stones, bathin asphalt and then solidified stones.
Every single stone of this wear layer, was bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles are moving on to it and the forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of power in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would spread even better," said the chemical engineer.
"Over the wear layer," he said, "a last layer is designed, the so-called load layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and it has to produce friction.
The most powerful of this road surface is to receive and distribute the load layer also requires an appropriate thickness and the material from which it is made must be maintained.
The weather conditions, in particular humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to be considered, especially water, "he said," because it significantly affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the site becomes moist, water enters the layer and is difficult to get back out. This causes a softening of all layers of the road laying and as a result, the appearance of the potholes.
When a stroke hole is created, "he said," the cover layer will be removed first, while the wear layer will only be affected afterwards. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that should be maintained by the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs. "
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) stated that the vehicle load is another important cause of the occurrence of the potholes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road load must always be in relation to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that, in order to avoid frequent potholes, this regulation is respected.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research still had to be done, for example on asphalt emulsions, which were already on the market in other countries, and with which the buttocks were easily and without application of high temperatures.
What was missing from the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna did not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle is given his 14th title.
Once again, Valle del Cauca went out empty in the award of the crown to Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied to stand on the winning stage, to show a silver crown and the band she has shown as a new Miss Colombia.
With the result that was received this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the department already has 14 mistitles and Melina joined the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had almost held the crown in their hands. Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Marla de la (1988), Maréla (1989), Marínez (1989), Marínez (1989), Marínez (1989), Aldo (1989), Aldo (1989), Ala (1989), Alsándo (1989), Alsado (1989), Alsana (1989), Alnguez (1989), Alnguez (1989), Alnguez (1989), Alnguez (1989), Alnguez (1989), Alnguez (1989), Alnguez (1989), Alnguez (1989), Alnguez (1989), Alnguez (1989), Ala.
The big question that many are asking today is: What was missing?
For the result is the decline of a great favorite who had shown at every show that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. She had been chosen as the queen of the police and the Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that the beauty queens of Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had also received and took home the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered crucial for the decision of the jury to appoint her first Miss is that she had not convinced the answer to the question "Which book has affected you most and why?" she was asked by Martín Murillo Gómez by Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca answered the question:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a way to civilize, in the end I believe that the book that was most marked for my childhood is' The Little Prince 'a very deep-moving book.
At the moment I read 'guilt and atonement'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called 'passions'.
An answer that came up against little love, first because of the term 'civilize' and second because it had not specifically explained how each book she mentioned had influenced it.
But after the ceremony was completed, Melina said to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it is what must happen.
And for all people, please read a little 'The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the love of El Valle is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota said that the fact that she was the preferred one, who had taken all the incidences and had received all the prizes in advance (Gastronomy competition Oster, audience vote on the best hand-made costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates had made jealous, which the queen stressed, which was therefore not able to shine on the stage."
And this was noticed at her first performance in the bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton hotel and at her two lifts at the coronation party.
Although she was safe in both, she did not have the strength and the momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico showed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "Como en casa" program at the channel RCN, said that the fact that Melina was crowned as a miss, "shows that the candidate who won most prizes during the competition, after all, does not become queen."
In addition, at the end of the press, Valle went out of the way - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury about her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essential part of the National Beauty Competition.
It will have its reason that two days before the compilation of the international jury Lucy Doughty explained that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of their country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. One has to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling, that she had already worked on projects before taking part in the competition," she said.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of the derrief and fibrosis, which she was noted with in the stomach area. But that is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good nutritional habits and responsible physical work.
The coach of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there was better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on the stomach, which was, to be honest, hard to see, pressed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos considers that the mistake of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical intervention she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to make them do right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place had to pay her. "
Because of this prize, which is awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel prediction was created after the appearance in the swimsuit, which was to become true at night. It was described that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize in order not to let them enjoy the crown.
Whether that is true or not, the fact is that Melina is starting her year of domination from today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that allows her to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions at the appointment of the National Beauty Competition.
However, she will enter into history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, had escaped the crown.
So was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A loposkopist from Cali went into history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano."
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November, a loposkopist from the Public Prosecutor's Office (CTI) from Cali, as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), received: "Alfonso Cano" by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven loposcopists in the CTI department, this week Eliazar González was on call, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in criminal proceedings for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career González worked in the communities of Chocó, where he often had to go to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he was supposed to identify were found.
In 2000 he settled in Valle over and after the completion of the necessary courses he specialized in loposcopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to friction, i.e. the hand and foot surfaces.
In the week of the operation against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was pointed out to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night, he flew from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodies and that there was a suspicion that one of the men who had led the world's oldest guerrilla could be. Therefore, he should take the ten-finger print of Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name) with him.
However, when he reached the place where the body was located with the most investigation, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, because this was not the least similar to the pictures he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, had no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a plant cellar and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with those on the print sheet.
He had seen right: it was "Alfonso Cano."
The same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for telling the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was actually the head of the FARC.
Trace search
The assessment given by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use against "Cano" was very important for a dactylobuy from the Sijín in Cali.
Many people don't know our work.
The dactylocopy is an exact science without error rate, which can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Not only do they identify bodies, they also support investigations into murder and robbery, and confirm the identity of the persons arrested.
When they're arrested, many criminals put in false identification papers or they don't have any.
We'll take their fingerprints and find them in the database.
The researcher told us that in a theft he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house, because the thief had just raised himself with his hand at this point when he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are not suitable for fingerprinting, but in this case we could take the print of the whole hand and identify the criminal who had participated in several theft," he remembered.
With the help of fingerprints, murder suspects can also be relieved or charged.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by liquor bottles.
The investigation suspected that a family member could be a suspect, and in fact a fingerprint on the bottle was agreed.
Although this does not guarantee that this is the killer, it is linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A dactyloscope of the CTI said that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object."
When they appear, a plant cell or a band is used to take away.
After that, the prints are sent to Asif, that's the criminal database, or to the staff.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identification papers," said the expert from the CTI.
He said that not everything was the same as it would be shown in the TV series SCI.
Just as not everything is gold that shines, not everything you touch is a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a corresponding comparison.
The "outrages" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters were in tents in Zuccotti Square.
A large part of it was in line with the clearance order and changed its location to a nearby park.
The members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement called on the authorities of New York this Tuesday to try again with a court order to enter the Manhad Square after they had been emptied from the square in the morning and tried to occupy another place at the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters came together in front of the Zuccotti Square, on which they wanted to give access to the "outrage" in this place. Meanwhile, another part of the movement held the clearance order and occupied a park further north of the city, where there were nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square, we will meet in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the speakers of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street."
Bray stated that the response of the "outrages" to the clearance of her camp, which was ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to court, where the judge Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibited the violent clearance of the place and allowed the protesters to camp.
In addition, the "Emperors" occupied a new park, which is located at the intersection of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is owned by the Trinity Church.
They could occupy the place for at least an hour, but after that, the police arrived and arrested some of the protesters, although Bray cannot give precise figures. He assured the news agency Efe that he also saw several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization assures that hundreds of people have come to this place, where a division of religious leaders had also arrived as a sign of their support for the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti Square (a private property site) is closed in anticipation of a judicial hearing, which is still scheduled for Tuesday, and in which the legality of the clearing in the morning is to be analysed.
Some of the protesters driven by the square carried and distributed photocopies of this court order. They even gave them to some police officers who were guarding the place, which led to "some small clashes," as Bray reported, who had shown some policemen to have beaten protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from clearing off members of Occupy Wall Street and the application of "laws adopted after the occupation and prohibiting the protesters from returning to the park with their tents and other things they had used before."
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear to the press that, due to this judicial order, the new opening of the place for public transport and the protesters had been lifted, and the protesters pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to reestablish themselves with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the clearance of the Zuccotti place, which was carried out in the morning grey, where almost 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the protesters "violated the law."
Bloomberg said that he had given the order to clear the place because it "had turned into a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people," because "some business had received threats" and the residents "were afraid of their quality of life."
"The clearing in the morning was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is essentially interested in protecting the financial interests and not in protecting the interests of the North American workers," added the speaker of the movement, who accused the mayor of "not respecting the freedom of the press."
The leaders of "Occupy Wall Street" informed that they were thinking about organising "big actions" for Thursday, together with community organisations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have already taken place since September 17.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the TV Christmas show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will be performing on December 1 in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement," lifeguard in "Baywatch," rabbit at "Playboy," the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary at a Christmas show on Canadian television.
The private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson, together with the "crooner" (ballast singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will play in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and will give life to a very special Virgin Mary.
Today, CTV spread pictures of the television program in which Anderson - also for the spread on the Internet of a self-turned porn, in which she appears together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe," Tommy Lee - as a Virgin Mary with a doll in the lap that Jesus is to represent.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, recently worked as a moderator on the show "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen, as a Jesuschild.
The Christmas programme of CTV not only focuses on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires, and who is not far from this controversy.
At one of his concerts in New York, Bublé recently called the North American woman Kim Kardashian "whore."
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP is growing by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of free fall from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still in recovery after the destructive earthquake that led to a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster that Japan had experienced in World War II.
The government's first estimates in Tokyo assessed the material damage to 300 000 dollars, a blow that seems to be weakening despite the difficult world economic situation.
After three quarters of the case, the data on gross domestic product from July to September were used to complete this chapter at last: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the rate of the year.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan the financial year starts in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be explained in part by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the 0.9% decrease in investments recorded from January to March, the first fall after six months of unstoppable increases.
However, the actual change in the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on Keynsian attacks that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan is particularly awake thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increasing expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure.
The Stigma of the yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - is in one of the "home currencies" of investors fleeing from the eurozone's debt crisis and the weak forecasts for the US, a privilege that is like a grave on the accounts of the export companies.
With a harder currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of large technology producers.
For example, Toyota and Sony returned their weak business results from July to September to the listing of the yen.
While markets continue to besiege the peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
"One must pay attention to the continuing risks, for example the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said the State Secretary for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
The prospects are really not very exciting.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that in September most Member States had shown more clear signs of a slowdown in economic development.
The indicator, which anticipates the turning points of the world economy, revealed that the brake would have been drawn with the largest economic potential.
Because he fell by four tenths to a total of 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The euro area is even below this average, which is 100, after falling by eight-tenth to 99.13 points.
Athens brings back doubts
Papadimos says the austerity measures will be adopted, but the conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the high-level risk premiums of the peripheral countries and a wide range of uncertainty, Greece is also further lost in the labyrinth that results from the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is more of a response to the pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of the political forces is slowly demonstrated by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the one hundred days he had been appointed may be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democratia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new austerity measures and would not, in any case, withdraw his call for new elections on the scheduled date, February 19.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the 26 October summit," said Papadimos yesterday to open a parliamentary debate that will be at its peak tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 employment promotion programmes, the reform of civil servants' disciplinary law and new measures to combat tax evasion are the first initiatives.
However, Samara's communication does not give rise to doubts about his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to supporting the transitional government, but not to anything else."
The conservative leader went a step too far with his challenge of the EU and the IMF, the organism that has to unblock the 8000 million that Athens urgently needs, and he made it clear that he would not approve a commitment to the implementation of the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated by the impact of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that it was not to be said that economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties did not sign a clear written agreement as soon as possible.
The spokesman of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the Troika inspectors would return to Athens "very soon" to discuss "what is needed" for the payment of the sixth section of "EUR 8000 million," although there is no final date.
The Greek cuff still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the "dominant" position of Spain in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has a dominant position in the role of micro-finance worldwide."
The Queen Sofía of Spain yesterday recalled that in the last two decades Spain has become the world's second donor for this means of international cooperation. His "being" is based on the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for the whole of humanity based on human confidence."
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the fifth world summit on micro-credit in Valladolid. She was convinced that there was "no doubt" that this type of business would be "absolutely essential" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and "in particular the goal of living the number of people who have to live with income of less than one dollar a day, that is below the" poverty line. "
Spain "continues to work" to extend the network of beneficiaries "to the last corner of the world and it performs this task responsibly," said Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will be taken from the summit, which will last until Thursday, "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and, in particular, women" are the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have seen many successes" and "face many challenges."
The summit on micro-credit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform for "two fundamental objectives."
The Queen stated that it was intended that 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and that ten million of these households would exceed the poverty line.
In Spain and the rest of the world, the concept of micro-credits is based on the path "initiated" by Muhammad Yunus years ago, which the Queen Sofia considers to be an "act of justice and recognition."
She described the father of this financial instrument as an "admirable idealist who has committed himself to the fight against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to get to know the loan strategy on the ground.
This experience followed a year later the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings on the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. In all of them, "we can observe a continuous development," the Queen explained, whose commitment to this project she brought yesterday the assessment as "head of the family" in Valladolid and "advocate of the poor."
Finally, Queen Sofia finished her lecture by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and to find solutions to the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment'
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical requirement" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, it stressed that it was a mistake to commit development aid to times of economic boom, because it was a "permanent commitment."
Jiménez felt that the micro-credit was a "serious and rigorous policy for eradicating poverty," and that the governments of the developed countries should now "work more than ever" according to solidarity criteria and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to fall victim.
For Spain, the micro-credits are one of the "most important forms of development aid."
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, said "success," "marginalized" people, "who are always in front of closed doors to give" hope, "and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that opens" their gates, inspired by the spirit of solidarity. "
The CDU proposes to elect the EU President on the basis of a general vote
The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig) was the first day for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian-Democratic Party, without any real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally provided for in the programme, but was in the autumn, in particular in order to ensure that the activists who consider the policy of the Greek government to be too lax today and perhaps Italy tomorrow.
The European Commission's presidential request proposed by the Bureau was almost unanimously adopted.
Of 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against, and ten had abstained.
The standing ovation lasting for several minutes, which, due to the intervention of Angela Merkel, as well as a few hours later Wolfgang Schäuble, was not a doubt on the part of the three European-oriented finance ministers.
The main idea of the Chancellor - as is the claim - is the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe."
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro."
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe."
This could be reflected by a modification of the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the control of the European Union as regards the budget policy of the countries in the euro area, but this could also be reflected in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote "in order to give Europe a face."
However, this is in any case one of the proposals adopted by Congress, which clearly stood by Wolfgang Schäuble Pate.
Of course, it is unlikely that the 47 will soon agree on this revolution: Groβ Britain is opposed to this, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
However, the milestone is laid.
Similarly, in an overwhelming majority, delegates have rejected the proposal of each country's weighting on the ECB 's Executive Board according to the weighting of the individual economies, which would obviously lead to a strengthening of the position of Germany.
The Chancellor in charge of calming the climate within her party has therefore strengthened the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has no longer tried to win her Congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty, which would immediately criticise the arrogant Germany.
As far as the Europe request is devoted to the importance of "German-French friendship" a paragraph, Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
For this reminds us that Leipzig was at the centre of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the fraud in the case of disease reports represent?
After the family allowances, UMP and government are now starting the disease reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 November to visit a family aid cup and to present a speech on the issue of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has been recurring since 2007.
In order to support this attack, which is based on the aim of subjecting the economy to a hard test, but on the other hand it is no less a pretext for an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority want to focus on employee disease reports.
First of all, with budgetary objectives: the government is calling for the introduction of a fourth day of care before taking into account a health report for workers in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick worker would lose the pay of four days without the consent of the specific company, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos", threatens to expel anger, but would help to bring in 280 million euros.
And those who would be more symbolic with another measure: to give the public officials an unremunerated day of care in the case of the disease (so far, there is no period of care for them in the opposite of the three days in the private sector).
While these issues are in the debate, the majority are also emerging from the subject of fraud, which is aimed at the abuse of the labour force.
"Controls will be much more important, and they will also be back-paid if required," warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday, November 13, before the microphone of the radio station RTL.
As in other cases, the effects of this report on the reality of fraudulent acts in the field of disease reports seem to be a little disproportionate.
This is, in fact, the subject of permanent observation since 2002, as well as political offensive, which have most often borne fruit.
The French are no longer sick more than people from other countries in Europe.
However, we are first of all in the country-wide figures.
According to the CNAM national health insurance fund, more than 237 million euro of daily deposits were paid in 2006.
According to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Health, the day-to-day financial statements in 2008 accounted for 5% of health expenditure, with 11.3 billion euros.
This amount was 46% for maternity leave and accidents at work and 54% for sickness leave, which is EUR 6.2 billion.
And then 2.5% health expenditure.
In 2010, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, the French were granted only 14.5 days of disease compared to the 17.8 days in 2009.
One mean that covers some differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, website for career planning, showed that 75% of the 40,000 people interviewed, French workers, did not take a single day of disease.
Another study, this time covered by health insurance, shows that 37% of the disease reports in 2010 were of less than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Thus, compared with their European neighbours, French workers are no longer more likely to become unemployed than elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted by two researchers from the French State Science Research Centre (CNRS) in 2010 showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global rate of decline (disease or otherwise justified) was ossilised, between 10% and 11% in France, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in the case of disease reports is a very small proportion of undeclared work.
As far as fraud is concerned, there is only a weak impact here.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 means that there are systmatic controls on disease reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (Public University of Education and Training of Technicians and Engineers) found that 13% of the 285,000 of the realized short-term disease reports, which are referred to in 37.050 cases, were unjustified or too long. "
In the systematically controlled cases of disease over 45 days of duration, less than 1.2 million 11% of "unadjusted or unjustified" cases were reported to be 132,000.
In total, this makes 169,000 "unjustified" cases for several million workers who have claimed a disease report.
A point that represents only a weak extent to, for example, those of undeclared work.
According to UMP Member Dominique Tian, author of a substantive report on this issue published in July, this represents a tax loss of between EUR 9 and 15 billion per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus much more than the defraud of the latter.
Papados: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece needs a new adjustment programme to catch up with its economy.
This was announced on Monday, 14 November by Prime Minister Lucas Papados before Parliament, adding that the one hundred days granted to his government by the Union were not enough to carry out this task.
"In order to continue the efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the Prime Minister in his first public speech in opening the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurosummit on 27 October was the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation within the euro area was "at stake" as it added.
Accordingly, Mr Papados has planned to reduce the country's government deficit "by 9%" of the gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The rights reject the new austerity measures
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the head of the right wing, had given his consent to the measures already approved in relation to an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but had announced that his party would not be prepared to take an additional austerity measure.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting of his party's New Democracy.
He had agreed on the guidelines for reducing budget deficits and debt, as well as the fight against waste, but was hostile to any policy that would stop the economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, EU Commissioner responsible for economic and monetary affairs, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary loan of EUR 8 billion without a written guarantee from all parties on their support for the planned measures, replied Antonio Samaras that his word was enough and he would not sign anything under pressure from outside.
The European Parliament, the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers, are in a position to take a decision on this matter.
The Canadians live in denial of death, as a report of the Royal Society of Canada shows
The body stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together to provide the best pain-reducing means, and this also goes beyond the cancer cases.
The Canadian society lives in an attitude to death.
Only 9% of the Canadians actually agree to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and take dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts have been involved, who are linked in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the criminal law in such a way as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia, where this choice arises, in patients who are considered to be able to make such a decision.
As a start, the experts are quoting a recently published survey of the independent society EIU, which had compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the earth.
Although Canada has placed itself on the 10th rank, the study notes that "medical care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to address the issue of death."
Medical care or not: 77% of the Canadians have no access to painkillers, so the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada tell us.
And despite the Canadian's majority desire to die at home, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
From the whole country, the rate is highest at 86% of hospital deaths in Quebec.
In the sensitive question of euthanasia and associated suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already expressed its intention of not making any changes to the law on euthanasia and accompanied suicide.
However, according to the experts who have equally inspected all those countries whose approach to euthanasia and accompanied suicide have legalized or decriminalised, there is no evidence that such a decriminalisation would lead to misuse in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanied suicide of incompetent or non-consensual persons.
On the contrary, there are much more cases of such violations in countries where euthanasia and associated suicide are not legalized, as confirmed yesterday by Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, in a telconference.
"Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Also accompanied suicide is practised in Canada, although here clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support the euthanasia
Let us bear in mind that according to an Angus-Reid survey carried out in 2010, 85% of the Canadians had already expressed themselves in favour of euthanasia, as they believe that they have allowed people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the fact that the euthanasia is legalized does not result in the message that the life of older or disabled people is of less value.
As regards the persons who have already practiced an accompanying suicide, 41% of the respondents believe that they should not be persecuted in criminal proceedings.
As regards the maintenance or discontinuation of the medicine in patients, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
They also suggest in their list of recommendations that the criminal law should state that the removal of funds for which a legal refusal has been made should not be considered criminal.
The expert body also calls for health professionals to be trained in the task of respecting the end of life and to fear this without prosecution.
The body stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain-reducing treatment to provide the best pain-reducing means, and this also goes beyond the cancer cases.
Finally, the Committee calls for at least consideration to be given to the means already used in the Canadian health care institutions to alleviate pain or to the end of life, as they were not used as a means of reducing physical pain, as was the case in the case of euthanasia, and they are concerned with the same procedures.
Other experts' reservations
Some experts in the legal field of health have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has called the position of the reporting experts, among other things, "extreme," as these do not limit the euthanasia practice in the patients in the final phase.
"This opens the doors to a situation in which everyone who is tired and over 18 years of age is asking another person to help him in his suicide," said RA Deschamps, who had seen a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to place the individual's own responsibility over all the other values involved in the social activity of society.
But now, he says, there would be "guidelines and obligations in a society."
Margaret Somerville, a specialist in health law, has also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she identified as a "pro-euthanasia manifesto."
Margaret Somerville, who himself is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, doubts in particular the report on the non-existence of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and associated suicide are legalized, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign
Damascus denies a "plot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The Partisans Bashar al-Assads demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria's Bashar al-Assad, which, thanks to Russia's support, has been strengthened yesterday.
Two days before the Arab League's withdrawal from Syria, the European Union has strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, have taken a position in favour of President Assad's resignation.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the Arab Prime Minister, who had called on President Bashar al-Assad to "establish his power of office in Syria," in which the forty civilians and members of the government were already killed.
"If Bashar were the interest of his country in the heart, he would resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life," said the King of Jordan, the neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish diplomat, Ahmet Davutoglu, had, on his own, complained that the Turkish mediation attempts that had been directed to the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East, who are not in peace with their people and cannot satisfy them, must go," he said, in an allusion to Syria, the neighbouring country, to which Turkey is taking a constantly raging attitude.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the activities of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries such as Turkey have made an ever-increasing sound in the face of the repression in Syria," says Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
During this time 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government in the region of Dar'a in the south of Syria were killed, the Syrian Observatory on Human Rights announced OSDH.
According to this NGO, two other civilians were killed in "shooting and major bombing of Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs.
At a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Trade Minister, Walid al-Mualim, nevertheless, felt that the country "was heading towards the end of the crisis."
He has, by the way, made a strong response to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from his duties, which he considers to be a "dangerous step."
"will not give up," he added, "the conspiracy against Syria would fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now examining a "civil protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, the media and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also expressed his support for the deployment of UN observers in order to protect civilians from the regime's repression that is entrenched in his "paranoia."
An extraordinary new meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan for the outbreak of the crisis adopted on 2 November, in particular the controversial and expected withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities, as well as the release of detained protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lawrow considered the decision of the Arab League to be "incorrect" yesterday in order to protect himself against the support of possible sanctions against Damascus, although China had already called for Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls on the markets to be patient and Italy to be ready to sacrifice
Mario Monti, the future Italian head of state, has called for a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a programme that "victims" demand to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last few months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held a negotiation with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his task to convene a cabinet to Parliament, which is relatively strict in the form of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, Member of the European Parliament, one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the discussions after meeting with the President-in-Office of the Council.
Mr Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Members, had to wait for Mr Monti to give Parliament a vote of confidence by Friday to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The agreements will culminate in the presentation by M. Monti of a list of matches, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr Monti commented that yesterday's nervousness of the stock exchange and bond markets required their time.
In "a democracy there are certain time limits" to prepare a government and a government programme, he stressed, saying, "it is safe that markets will show their strength and understanding."
His appointment by the President was welcomed by the markets at the beginning, but the unrest had again increased, especially after an unexpected industrial production decline in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister-in-Office was to establish a staff consisting of mainly technocrats, although he had stressed that he would also like to include "politicians."
The new government should only exist by 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the President of the Chamber of Representatives, the new government was to receive Parliament's confidence until Friday.
Mr Monti has committed himself to working in the sense of urgency in order to make Italy a "new protagonist" in Europe since his start.
A speaker from EU Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that "our diagnosis of the Italian economy itself does not change, taking into account the new government."
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its budget compensation target in 2013, despite the austerity plans adopted in these last months, has in particular requested new tough measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, head of the "Italy, which will meet on Tuesday in Monti, also insists on the need for economic growth," as a country that has no growth can not respect the deficit indicators. "
Mr Monti, who is known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an "era change" in Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes the "challenge of trust" as well as a "other Italy," says the key authors.
The great unknown here see the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, as Italy is now in favour of EUR 200 billion of state bonds by April 2012.
Russian scientist helps the Iranian nuclear energy programme
A Russian scientist, Wjatscheslaw Danilenko, has helped Iran to develop a nuclear-using explosive capsule, so on Monday an American NGO specialized in nuclear risks confirmed.
The ISIS Institute of Science and International Security is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency (AEA) and other documents from this UN Agency to identify this scientist.
The AIA had reported its "serious concern" last week on the occasion of a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to an ongoing study of the AIA documents by ISIS, the Danilenko, born in 1934, had been working for over three decades in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Cheljabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991 he was supposed to have left the centre to set up a company in Kiev that produces "nano diamonds."
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before he returned to Russia, he then participated in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the AIA referred to "strong evidence that the Iranian development of" a nuclear explosive system "had been supported by the work of a foreign expert who, not only in this technology, was not only hibernating but also, as a member of the Agency's state said, had worked on this technology directly on the military nuclear energy programme of his country of origin over and above all."
Anti-Islamic crimes and offences have increased by 50%
The crimes and offences directed against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racist or religious-motivated violence crimes, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday, have either slightly decreased or have only slightly increased over the same period.
According to these data, the total number of violence crimes committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49%, while a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in the number of crimes directed against Jews and a 14% global increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes had been recorded.
The total number of "hate-motivated crimes" had increased to 6,628 in a very weak manner, including 47.3% by racial differences and 20% by religious differences of motivated crime, the FBI says.
"After a weakening in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes and crimes grow again," the Human Rights Organization stressed. "The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organisation added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had for a long time stressed that the violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," Paul Legendre, a member of the organisation, added.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he added, with the view that this could be done in an improved police attitude to "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" is a legacy of the era of the fight for civil rights in American federal law.
This legislation had been adopted after the death of Martin Luther Kings in order to punish acts of violence directed against race, skin color, religion or origin and now also includes crimes of sexual belonging.
Twitter is changing the platform and is more and more similar to Facebook
On Monday, the Microblogging website Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform, in particular to enable its users to monitor the activities of those who follow their entries, which once again makes the service similar to that of Facebook.
The new "activity" tab and another "name" make it possible to track and track the activities of other "twitteers," the Internet user, their messages ("Tweets").
This allows them to find out whether they allow them to track their messages, whether they subscribe to new posts, to favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer was tested before its general Internet distribution on Monday "in August with a small percentage of users," the Twitter speaker Carolyn Penner reported to the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, covered with some esoteric-like wording (RT to repeat the contribution of another person). followFriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniment plus comparable a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google +.
In the network, users discussed this innovation through the use of certain "tweets" on the Internet.
"This is useless, intrusive and is too much Facebook," writes @ jemb123.
"The function" activity "will help me to better track certain elements of my flux-twitter," said @ dannykronstrom.
Austria
Registration of a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution
The Austrian government of the great social-democratic / Christian-democratic coalition, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution in order to reduce public deficits and to avoid any degradation by rating agencies in the top credit quality of Austria (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who had announced this decision of the Council of Ministers, although the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, much above the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debt level of the countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's ability to pay did not fall at a stroke from AAA to AA +, we would have to pay an additional EUR 3 billion each year," said Michael Spindelegger, Vice-Chancellor and Christian-Democratic Foreign Minister.
Austria is also calling for the Brussels Summit of the Member States of the euro area on 26 October: at that time, the Heads of State and Government would have called for the reduction of public deficits to be included by the end of 2012 and a return to the public balance of accounts in the Constitution or by adopting an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian Government in this respect is similar to the "German model," since Germany had been the first European country to have incorporated such a "rule" into the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of GDP each year, and from 2017, the state's structural budget deficit should not exceed the 0.35% limit of GDP, while regional states, as well as local authorities, should have balanced budgets.
The objective is to eliminate budgetary debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement in the 2020 / 21 horizon.
Strong Yen
Noda is threatened with a new intervention on the monetary markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authority would again intervene in the monetary markets if the yen continued to rise.
"If we find an excessive volatility" in the Yen exchange rate, "we will intervene as we did the last time," said Mr Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday the yen was in turn close to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on 31 October.
On that day Tokyo had sold massive yen for dollars to lower the Japanese foreign exchange value, which is about to raise a new record value since 1945 against the dollar.
However, the yen has increased regularly, doped by the purchases of investors who see the yen as a "refuge" in these uncertain times of world economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell under 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro fell under the symbolic latte of 105 yen near the levels that had tripped the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis 2008-2009, the dollar recorded around 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
The Japanese foreign exchange's straw fire is damaging the archipelago's exports, as it charges the cost of the "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value of Japanese companies from abroad, as they exchange them in national currency.
"Japan is fighting for its reconstruction after the earthquake and the tsunami on 11 March, which have devastated the Tohoku region (northeast)," stresses M. Noda, who fears that this increase in the yen could already kill the weak recovery in the germ.
The third world economic power, with growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter, has again gained power for the first time this year thanks to the springy export disasters and the consumption of the "looted" households by the disaster.
The Prime Minister, however, estimates that the yen's inflation does not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan."
The Minister for Finance Jun Azumi, for his part, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to disarm the yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, Deputy Governor of the Institute, has informed that the BoJ has already launched "appropriate measures," making it possible to state that no additional currency easing is to be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the Notenbank had increased its state bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to cover the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) that it had spent on various purchases of financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest rate feet fast to the height, stock exchanges make retreat
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis is constantly undermining the European key figures.
Despite the new heads of government in Greece and Italy, and the best growth rates in France and Germany, the rates of the weak countries are constantly increasing.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the euro area, also drifted a little more into negative files this Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10: 00 and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt fell by 0.4%, and London by 0.1%.
"As a result of the new tensions regarding the return on government bonds in the euro area in difficulty, world stock markets continue to spend part of their recent profits.
"The capital investors are nervous and are only too aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the Reuters Press Agency.
The Tokyo stock exchange, which in turn suffers from the renewed fear of market participants about the capacity in Europe that the debt crisis is continuing to grow, had closed with a rate of 0.7%.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has turned its eyes on Europe, and trade is moving towards limited range corridor, as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized," estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This revival of concern about the future of the euro area is damaging to the single currency, which continues its bass on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for a month and a half.
At around 10 o'clock, the European currency was worth 1,3570 dollars, so it was down by 0.4%.
According to the stock exchange brokers, it has decreased after the CDU, the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered in Congress on Monday, had granted an application, in particular, providing for the possibility for countries in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
Italy and Spain are still at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning, the return on the Italian bonds reached 6.85% for 10 years, the Spanish title matured to 6.2%.
These tensions in interest rates in the southern countries, as well as in France, continue to raise investor concerns.
The future Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation of paralysis threatened by the debt burden in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papados, had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the vicar of the markets, as the parliamentary elections take place on Sunday in the country.
The interest rate shear ("spread") between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has again reached a new, historical high.
Expected growth rates in the euro area
From a statistical point of view, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, a little better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office of INSEE had revised the figures of the second quarter, with a minus of 0.1% of the gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that most concerns the economic experts.
Germany, for its part, had growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first upturn of the whole euro area is expected at 11: 00, with the EU Commission warning of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should win over dogmas
If there is a subject that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or on the basis of emotions, this is certainly the energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of the companies.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting to start thinking about this issue and the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it analyses the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should give their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is pushing to double electricity demand by 2050, not to have to give up an enormous proportion of the world's population a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to reduce the shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity in a stable way, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a subject that has disappeared from the environmental debate, in order to fight climate irregularities.
The accident of Fukushima does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which is subject to its decision to the need to find a substitute source, nor in Switzerland, which is just about to build nuclear power plants of the last generation.
The UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name only a few countries, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, after Fukushima, decided to add another unit to its park by relaunching the three-mile island plant, which was closed after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model is sometimes set as a model for renewable energy sources, reality is contrary to the discourse.
The choice in Berlin will be reflected in an increase in the electricity price, an energy dependence, particularly on Russia, increased by the increased use of import gas, which will increase CO2 emissions from gas and coal power plants.
The total of these unpleasant effects will already be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives cause for thought.
Denmark is, on the one hand, the European table leader on wind energy, which accounts for 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, it is one of the largest users of coal and gas, alternately used with wind energy, and, on the other hand, its CO2 emissions and electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the stability of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than our French households.
As the energy price in the globalised economy is a key role of competitiveness and a stability pact for industry on national soil, French companies have an advantage because of the most favourable electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore lead to a strong increase in the energy price, which would make the noble statements about the reinindustrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power an illusion.
Surveys showed that this is a price that the large majority of French people are willing to pay as little as it shows resistance to the principle of this energy source.
Let us be clear that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410.000 jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a lot of specialised small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them the creators of countless jobs.
If France decided to get out of the nuclear power, a large proportion of these SMEs would be affected, and the annual EUR 6 billion of investment goods and nuclear energy exports would be increasingly shrinking.
Which electrician would be responsible for an SPD designed to work for 60 years if the decline of its producer was pre-programmed?
In order to solve the energy equation, one has to admit that there is no such thing as a devil's work as a miracle tool for the production of electricity.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva to use nuclear power and renewable energy demonstrate the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority that carries out uncompromising and transparent controls in existing works, such as the construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams, who have made a name for themselves because of their professionalism, are to be obsessed with the safety performance.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, and in Three Mile Island, has arrived under normal operating conditions, so it was without consequences for man and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was brought up by reactor construction as well as unjustifiable, human failure.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented proportions that caused the death of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident just as it had done after the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach, as well as cooperation between the safety authorities of the French and German nuclear power plant operators and constructors, the EPR is a draft that allows it to resist such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable to build a nuclear power plant among the electric technicians, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by leaving them free to draw the lead position in the inevitable nuclear development.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party maneuvers dominate a debate that will also determine the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from many angles - overload of police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to the figures, the compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights," as France had referred to itself.
Recently, the public-sector harassment against foreign students had marked the weekly shows, and the Minister of the Interior had announced at a time (see Libération of 23 May) that France "did not need any talent, walls or waiter from abroad."
But this policy has rarely been analysed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus between the right and the left on this issue.
On the right hand side, the tone was struck by Jacques Chirac, who said in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including more than 2 million immigrant workers, should not be a problem for a country," on the left hand side by Michel Rocard, who had explained in 1990 that France could not "take up all the poverty in the world."
The only difference is the degree of generosity
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by Horden Polish plumbers was shared by both the right and the left in 2005.
Both camps saw immigrants as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that one is willing to admit to immigrants.
In his programme, Francois Hollande is limited to banalities that point to partnership development allowing us to solve our "migration problems."
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on the elections, but it is economically costly.
As the economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron present to us in a recent work, which summarizes the latest findings on immigration (Exceptive People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists on the positive impact of immigration on economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigration countries.
Limiting immigration would reduce growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they are at risk of subjecting the domestic labour force, especially the less qualified, by exerting pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are, in fact, much more complementary than domestic wage workers, as they are primarily engaged in occupations in sectors that are technically unskilled.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not travel very much to domestic workers, the more qualified among immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not in line with labour supply.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulties working in a country where there is a lack of anaesthesists, this complementarity also results in a positive effect of immigration on wages and domestic labour market conditions between locals and migrants.
In this way, Giovanni Peri has calculated that a 1% increase in the flow of immigrants leads to a long-term, associated increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas and economic growth introduced by immigrants is beneficial (high proportion of native immigrants among American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to social systems, with an average of about 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organisation estimates that a person who emigrates to Germany at the age of 30 will, on average, make a net contribution (revenue minus expenditure) of around EUR 150,000 to the public budget over his life.
At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to create the missing "with the teeth."
These teeth, which were supposed to scare the immigrants, however, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable good; it is also a sensitive good.
The European continent should be able to remember who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had passed over the entire 20th century on the tragedies of the First World War, the Totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, and also Francos in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some had believed that it was sufficient to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible to see democracy once and for all prevail over its enemies.
It has been known since Napoleon "the little one" that this was a feature of the attitude of the mind.
The general right to vote, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition for this and can also become a "oppressive instrument," as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said at the time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organisation, separation and control of powers, education, education, economic and social community spirit, a case-law.
The crisis in Europe that we are in is an economic crisis, but it is also a political and democratic crisis.
The change of mind of the Greek True-False-Referendum would have had a two-pronged character in this respect: the need for a powerful return of politics, but also those of the worrying feeling of its impossibility, of its inadequacy.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have moved today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer aiming in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain to push for a success of the national referendum, which has been organized in a different way, depending on the needs and in a different order.
A free pass for the European only ruler or a leap with a connected eye into the emptiness of nationalist retreat: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, with full right, clear and steady, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - by the way, we do not know where to end the list - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is all of Europe that is bowing to the dictatorship of markets and credit rating agencies that is suffering from its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated at international level.
One is concerned about the transfer of sovereignty towards Europe - it is the whole of Europe, which is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus each of the nations associated with it.
The urgency is to give the people's sovereignty back to the leadership of the European project.
It is all about whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debt, free themselves from the markets and promote a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis has a condition for decisions at European level that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy without certainly leading us to ruin.
After the fight against this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists has been over for a long time, everyone is pressing for European economic governance to do so today.
All right.
But without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it is intended for the citizens - this would be a new folly and a further deadlock.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
In order to create the Republic in France, it was necessary to "create" Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not do enough here.
This information shall remain valid.
We must form a better integrated Europe at economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a more politically democratic Europe, a truly European people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Uncontacted" chip cards become the general good
The World Trade Fair for Chipcards opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic position.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 was supposed to end with an 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phone), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most powerful segment is the contactless technology that allows payments in public transport or the payment of purchases by simply keeping the card to a reading device.
Compared to the 320 million sold a year ago, 460 million contact-free chip cards should be sold worldwide!
Their market share should increase further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent more than 10% of the global chipcard market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in terms of contactless payment after it has long been in the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 non-contact visa cards have been distributed.
However, the consumer markets are making steam.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contact-free pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move to higher speed, it is now necessary for the banks to provide their customers with these cards.
"Two large French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically hand over to their customers, in the future, bank cards that are supplied with a non-contact chip," announces Gérard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
However, this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A small percentage of equipment has so far been equipped with the NFC technology (Near Field Communication) necessary to carry out these transactions.
"You have been delayed."
"But they should experience a real upward development at least next year."
"We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale had also announced yesterday that it would prepare the market launch of an offer that would allow its customers to make contact payment by mobile phone.
The terrorist front understands itself, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-awaited relations between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Vice-Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now obtained "certainty."
"The way in which both organisations act and the relations of the secret services point to clear cooperation," he said without further detail.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation of the abduction of two French people in Niger last January had encouraged interfaces on a day-to-day basis.
The Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, who were kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by Aqmi supporters, were killed at the same time as several of their kidnappers on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian investigators want to have found in the debris at the site several phone chips that belonged to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the phone calls led to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one leads to a Nigerian who has long been in Maiduguri, one city in the north of Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered to be the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a progress, but one must certainly wait for more clear evidence before one can speak of an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"It is possible, however."
"For years it has been known that the sect has received financial and intellectual support from outside and that it is increasingly active," the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo is mitigating.
In recent months, these "support services" have become more and more apparent, as have the speeches and operating modes of Boko Harem, which now indicate the use of suicide bombers and the use of ever more complex explosives that carry the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, to begin with Washington, has since then put pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have, in fact, for a long time considered the group to be a community of Illuminates, which should not be given particular attention.
Fast success
The Boko Haram, founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist faith of Mohammed Yusuf - which means so much in Haoussa as "Western education is a shame" - is following the establishment of an Islamic Emirates in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this medium-less region, the merger is rapidly successful.
It is political and demands strict respect for the Sharia, while the activists associated with it are committed to the fight against the godless central government.
The activists first have churches, bars and authorities in their sights.
In 2009, Boko Haram's activists were particularly active in their increased attacks against the Commissioners.
However, the reaction from Abuja is as usual indexed.
The army surrounds the city, you count 800 dead.
The captured Mohammed Yusuf is killed in prison.
As a result, the cult becomes increasingly radical and leaves its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas she confessed to an assassination in Jos, which demanded 80 lives, then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is assigned the debt of a suicide attack that took place in the secure police headquarters in Abuja - the first of his kind.
In August, the local seat of the United Nations becomes the priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has been a concern for all security experts since then.
While the Aqmi Mali and the Niger have occupied the Somalians of al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, on the occasion of a discussion with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Alain Juppé warned Boko Harem about Boko Harem and was ready to give all the information. "
The world according to the Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are rivaling in the simplification and ignorance of China, Iraq and Israel's help.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead a complex world with simple, not to say, simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidate like that, the voters could almost get that impression.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their fellow leaders have repeatedly made their statements and statements on foreign policy, the traditional Republican focus.
China, Iran and Israel's aid fall - often in no way supported - slogans.
With regard to the appointment of the Grand Old Party, the Chinese people were threatened to quote before the WTO and to quote the "currency manipulation" - a leading issue in an America that is at the forefront of the emigration of entire industries to Asia.
He said that if this is to imply the launch of a trade war, it would be stupid.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of external policy, has almost severed the air in terms of his being flattered by emotions.
He had called for a strong but constructive exchange of views with Beijing (also the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman is not answered because he stagnates in the depths of opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney had also praised military battles against Iran if the sanctions to stop the nuclear programme were to fail.
"If I am elected, I will stop Iran," he had sounded.
"If Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb."
He also promised Israel increased military aid and accused Obama of remaining guilty of this partner's obligations.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second most placed candidate, shows a shameful lack of knowledge of the file.
He recently called for the Chinese military threat to be taken into account, as Beijing "is trying to develop a nuclear power" - and it seemed to be a fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
The Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military battles against Iran, is, on his own, prepared to employ the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
Obama's 2009 ban on the use of torture measures against alleged terrorists was also supported by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
One is far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an external political weight.
The current presidential opponents have also had simple ideas and, despite all this, won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama was also a self-amateur and had to give water in his wine, which was the subject of anti-terror.
They are right to insist on the failure of his naive disagreement with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also gave him the call of weakness.
This is not so unforced, however.
The population is more likely to appreciate the positive balance of national security under Obama, which Bin Laden has taken out.
Since Iraq, it has been looking forward to military intervention that will lead to the defamation of the people.
And Obama is more surprised by the argument that America must be rebuilt economically in order to raise its leadership to new life.
North Stream, new gate to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the Baltic Sea and connects the Western Europe directly with Russia, was put into operation.
It is intended to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to commit this event with gloss and Gloria.
More than 500 invited guests, including four Heads of State and Government, attended the inauguration of the new gas pipeline North Stream, which directly connects Russia and Germany under sea level, on the Baltic Sea coast under an orchestral sound and at a gourmet buffet.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon, and his colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands, have symbolically turned the control of the valve that drives Russian gas into the Western European network.
The new gas pipeline will provide 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gas per year through a first pipeline of 1,224 km in length, which connects the Saint Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, to Western Europe.
A second pipeline, which allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - equivalent to the French total consumption - will be completed at the end of 2012.
And you already make the possibility of building a third line sound on your own track.
For Gazprom, the timely and precise completion of this enormous building is like a victory.
The project was very controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream pipeline will allow direct gas supply to Germany, avoiding any road run by third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the land.
For this reason, these two countries are losing a little bit of their power: it is now more difficult for them to put pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, the most committed in the debate, was not to compare the North Stream pipeline with a "new German-soviet pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is extremely sensitive politically.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
This, however, is at the expense of a European energy degeneration, as the project has made a break between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has in almost five years completed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries with strong gas consumption and their gas supplies.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way," said François Fillon at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out in what degree the large gas contracts are also important from a political and economic point of view.
All of this explains the wide smile of the Gazprom managers in Lubmin, who are numerous, as regards the gas transmission.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater line is made up of steel with a concrete encapsulation, which it is intended to protect from ship anchors.
It rests on the sea floor, about 200 m deep.
In the construction of the mine fields from the Second World War, it was necessary to avoid.
"About hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed for the sake of caution," said Jens Müller, spokesman for the North Stream company.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The line is a long metal snake, heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, which is not interrupted by anything over the entire length: neither valves nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project leaders have taken away from it, because Sweden was not in a position to see a Russian state society on a permanent basis at the level of its coasts.
"In the case of a ovary, we close the gas flow in less than a minute," said Jens Müller.
In the case of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline is then released into the air.
However, this case is considered to be unlikely by the constructors, as the weld seam was estimated to be resistant to one leak per 100,000 years.
State monitoring of gas transmission is ensured by both an underwater robot controlled for external observation by a seagoing vessel and by a device circulating inside the gas transmission.
It has the form of a cigar, measures a meter in diameter, is introduced into the inside of the pipe and is moved through the gas pressure.
After three full days of movement through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on any deformations of the metal on its arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to work for fifty years without even having to be subjected to the least repair.
The gas circulation is easily guaranteed by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entry point, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have united their forces to achieve this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
The German companies E. ON and BASF are also classified here (15.5% each), as are the Dutch Gas Union and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have formed a business community called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It has its seat in Zug in Switzerland, where the tax is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented this company the entire capacity of its gas transport, on an extendable 20-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the real transport of gas is," said Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas pipeline was covered by 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amount was 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are sure to recover their expenses, as Gazprom alone is at risk of liability.
The gas pipeline is shown by a sandy, pine-wooded coastline at Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5-metre-high valves form the gas exit path.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is passed on to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with one million cubic metres of Russian gas per passing hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskin, a brand notebook.
From an Italian company created about fifteen years ago, Moleskin now wants to give new style to writing.
It has a flair of adventure, hours spent on candlelight with writing.
The notebook of Moleskin is easily revisible, with its black, rectangular enamel, its rubber band, the egg-shaped sides, as it is aged over time.
However, the Moleskin notebook, as we know it today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided at the time to bring a distinguished design notebook on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, then the company's specialist consultant, is responsible for the market introduction of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an old production technique called Mole Skin (Moulworfskin), which is called a tree cloud, which is used for example for the cover of upholstery benches.
This kind of notebook was very much asked among writers and travellers.
"Moleskin has revived an old and almost forgotten object, which was considered an icon of avant-garde artist until the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, now a brand-responsible at Modo Modo.
The success is coming.
Between 2006 and 2010 sales increased by 26% and are established with a sales of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first years in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a picture of the buyers, as the notebook also impresses business people as well as students and professionals.
Moleskin has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its early stages, employs more than 100 employees today and has two offices since 2008, one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company sells its notebooks in bookshops, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centres and understands how to enforce its identity.
"We have followed the spirit of time and his new writing needs, which exists despite the rise of e-mails," said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural character is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskin: recently the brand launched an exposure called "Detour (detour)," in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, at the film festival in Locarno, the company also launched a link with leopard patterns.
Moleskin benefited from its success and this cultural spirit of time and understood to diversify its products: bags, dates, fillers, computer covers... The brand has the entire range of articles.
A success that brings Neider to the plan: In the autumn of 2006 Modo Modo was bought up by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today's Syngenta Capital, and thus opened a new chapter in the history of the company Moleskin.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain so high?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today the "15th week of work for the disabled" begins.
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is always twice the average: 19% against 9% unemployment for the total population.
Determining?
"No, it is said that Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Association of Adopt, is the" week of work for the disabled. "
"The progress made within 15 years is significant."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not double, but three times as high."
"Nevertheless, a great deal remains to be done."
However, it must be said that there are still many obstacles for disabled unemployed people before they get a job.
It is more common for the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them have no degree and only 10,000 disabled people are among the 2.3 million students with higher education.
In the end, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% for the disabled compared to 38% in the total.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to get back into work, which are the "core of the problem," says Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992, which helps companies to recruit disabled people.
So much for the actual brakes.
It remains the unspoken, the spiritual attitudes that, while certain, are developing slowly.
A study carried out in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre for the magazine La Cité indicated that the managers interviewed have "a weak level of knowledge about the disabled," which is "overrepresented" by persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually disadvantaged persons. "
The result is that private enterprises with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to achieve the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, as laid down in a 1987 law.
These latter figures from 2008 indicate a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now at 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agefiph, the organisation responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not respect this law.
The proof: The number of "fees paying" establishments has decreased, as has the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which provides for increases in contributions, created a strong pressure on companies, said Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also expresses a real knowledge, especially among the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the establishments between 20 and 49 employees employ disabled persons, while enterprises with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What luck"
Even before they offered their forehead to the "Blue Tuesday nights (20: 45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide their pleasure that brought them the friendship game.
It would be too far-fetched to say that there was a secret agreement between them, but the image speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the audience stage of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have made a good and happy peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attack player against Turkey, the Belgian national trainer had only taken praise for his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," the native Liller, for his part, assures.
As for the contrast between his representation in the club and the National Eleven, "It is a unit that justifies everything."
"In Lille I am all year round, which is not the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to get to the start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought out Friday night against Romania regarding the match against France to finally "shine."
But without forgetting the note of "pleasure."
The French national team has been on fire since the age of 7, and he has been running his victorious field trains between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This will inevitably help to further strengthen the "unique" character of this encounter.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he says.
"We just got across the way."
"To play against them means great happiness!"
Leekens, on the one hand, made him sound "pride" with kindness.
"The pride of performing a galamatch."
"pride" also to confirm - in his capacity as "neighbours" - that France has "become a team at a very high level again," and that little more than a year after the Knysna trauma.
"Laurent Blanc did a really good job," he said.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician will see the plane with the blue (the French National 11) share... in the direction of Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out big," he said.
"We're planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will notice that in the upcoming games." The game against France will be included.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento is looking forward to the replay against Bosnia (22: 00) this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
Both teams had lost their expertise in playing the game.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that "La Selecçao," his national eleven, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the European Championship in 2012.
For Portugal, this means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play and disserve an opponent, Bosnia.
In view of the hindsight (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the game for more than an hour, but the team was unable to press the issue on the important stamp that would have taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, but it has a certain risk, since we have not reached a forward gate."
At home, however, in their brightly radiant state of de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to get in front of an audience that should be at stake as well, even if the game was of course announced as "very short," said the optimistic but clear Bento.
"We expect a very close match, but we are fully convinced that we can win the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have a 50% chance at the 2012 European Championship," but the successor of Carlos Queiroz relatified.
The undecided on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to reach and win a goal.
An indecision can already be sufficient for the Bosnians, who also need a gate.
"This is a good result, but it has a certain risk, since we have not reached a forward gate," Bento regrets.
"We will compete against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As already in Zenica, the Portuguese would have the intention to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning to "give them no time to think."
A good idea, provided it is implemented this time.
