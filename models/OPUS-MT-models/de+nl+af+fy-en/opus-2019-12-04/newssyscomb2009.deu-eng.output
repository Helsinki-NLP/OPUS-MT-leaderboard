Triumph of the right-wing lists in Austria, total they come to 29 percent
After the first preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria brought a marked weakening of both parties to the so-called great coalition and a clear strengthening of the right-wing populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly serious losses, where the position of former chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the brink.
In contrast, the head of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Carinthia national captain Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to federal politics.
The social democracy (SPÖ) remains the country's strongest force, with 29.8% of the votes, but it loses 5.5% of the votes in 2006 compared to the last elections in 2006.
The ÖVP cut even worse, which loses almost nine percent of the votes at 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the post-war history of Austria, and especially in the People's Party, which had called for the early elections, this is a truly disastrous result.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP had left the coalition, the People's Party had a clear lead ahead of the SPÖ.
But the voters probably punished the party for making the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculation about a possible resignation of the party president and former vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be the case already on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party board.
Such a development would probably pave the way to the most likely way out of the electoral debate, that is to renew the great coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Liberals (FPÖ) received 18 percent, the BZÖ received 11 percent of the votes - but at the same time expressed its fear that 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party agreed with the Populists (at that time the FPÖ was still uniform, in 2005 it split from the BZÖ) with regard to a common government, which had even caused sanctions on the part of the European Union.
It is clear that Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with each party and is going back to Vienna in the Austrian federal policy.
The Green Party also moved to Parliament, but it suffered slight losses and slipped from the third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four-percentage hurdle and therefore did not move to Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists who have been accused of the illegal collection of bugs in India, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg considers that there could be a certain cooling down of Czech-Indian relations.
This was stressed by the Minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not clear, then sure, then there will be a certain cooling," he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks that the executive could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
Despite all this, he argued that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of the charge and received a fine, the central government with the local government in Dardjiling, in which case the matter falls.
"His problem could be resolved," said the Minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years of imprisonment, Mukherdshi's view would be best if he were to appeal to a higher court.
He could thus request the release of bail and, in freedom, wait for his judgment, according to the Minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had also expressed his views in negotiations.
"He recommends a vocation to a higher court, then he would be eligible for a pardon," said the Chief of Czech Diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to get the convicted "competent legal support," led the Indian Minister.
At the same time he said that such aid was already offered to them by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit that, "said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, the Czech press agency ČTK, in front of his partner, confirmed the Czech Republic's importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it's a big mistake to arrest and charge these Czech scientists," he said.
An answer to the question whether he had been given an undertaking from the Indian side to deal with the matter, the Minister left out.
"I've already been promised quite a lot," he just said.
A Czech judge over the struggle for the sea-ground
It is based on an electronic map on which Australia and the adjacent sea areas are represented.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it also the adjacent sea ground.
The area is as large as the continent itself, "said the Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is one of the thirty-head staff of the UN division for oceans and sea rights.
His head, the Divisions Director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and complements it.
This is where work elves and enthusiasm rule.
The sea ground has so far a little known world rich in natural sources.
This is where oil is found, and other ore and other non-renewable raw materials, but also so far unknown living organisms, which have, for example, the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A sea ground, larger than the mainland
The countries of the Anrain have now vehemently declared their right to the new sea areas.
In fact, according to a UN Convention, they use their rights to which they agreed in Montego Bay in Jamaica in 1982.
It is mainly the territory of the so-called continental shell, which often reaches up to a few hundred kilometres far from the shore of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental regime.
"Simplified, the continental shale is considered to be the part of the sea floor and its soles, which is a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It crosses the borders of the sea of the river, often the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone, "Mikulka explains.
The application submitted by the relevant country to the Commission for the purpose of setting the external borders of the continental system must be supported by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-intensive studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical support to the Commission.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications, from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have been successful, "adds Mikulka.
A recent international echo was the success of Australia, which was the first country to significantly increase its maritime areas.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the extension of the sea floor, which was approved by the Commission last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometres, that is, about six times the size of the state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigation.
The profit that will come to them in the future from the use of the sea floor will, as they promise, have an invaluable value.
Other countries will also submit their applications gradually.
They can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the "Montego Bay Agreement."
Where the continental claw ends, the area of the ocean floor, which is called the "common heritage of humanity" by the Convention, begins.
No state will have a special position here.
The right to promote in this area shall be conferred on an international institution set up by the Convention.
"The sea floor, however, is not a gold-digger land," says Director Mikulka with a little exaggeration and adds, "the individual areas of which are legally defined and the system is contractually anchored."
Czech in the Pacific
A part of the sea floor is now also owned by the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal."
This was given the status of a so-called "groundbreaking investor" in 1991, as did the investors of some less countries.
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton zone in the silent ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be examined by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The sea floor is divided there, it is a kind of Tatra on the sea floor.
"There you can promote on an area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich source of polymetal concrete containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese, "another jurist, the Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev Division will bring such a design.
She reminds of a small potato or, with some imagination, of the legendary shem that the legend has brought to life after the Golem.
German special forces were on-site in the case of hostage release
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to solve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it got serious, the special units were ready, but they were not used.
In the circumstances of the 11 European tourists kidnapped in Egypt, more and more details are being made known.
According to the Ministry of Defence and Home Affairs, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue.
As a result, both specialists of the Federal Army and officials of the GSG 9, the Fliegerstaffel of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and logistics experts of the Technical Assistance Agency were at the place of liberation.
However, as speakers of the ministries on Monday night further reported, the German forces were not needed because the hostage-takers let their prisoners run and fled when they saw signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by Germany to involve them as local support forces.
"Fortunately, it has not come to that," said a spokesman of the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
Attackers had taken the travel group from the five Germans, five Italians, a Rumanian and their eight Egyptian companions in the south of Egypt on September 19.
After the abduction in a desert area in the south of Egypt, the hostages had been dragged in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage-takers remained unclear until the last, as well as the details of the liberation or possible ransom payments.
The saved have arrived in Cairo in the meantime.
Steinmeier said the free hostages were in the care of the German Embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
At first there was no information in Berlin when they would return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are to be flown out with an Airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
US House of Representatives rejects rescue package
The first chamber of the US Congress has almost failed the $700 billion rescue package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones ran into the deep.
With 206 votes to 227, the US House of Representatives rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite all the calls made by US President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, there was no majority in favour of the programme that was intended to contain the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the supporters had desperately tried to convince the critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called on Members to agree, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for the prevention of something that has not yet occurred," he admitted.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones broke down by more than six percent or 600 points.
The investors were concerned that the government's rescue package could fail.
He recovered just before the end of the vote, and then, after the failure was announced, he returned to the House.
Experts now expect further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order to enter into force of the programme, the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is necessary.
Organised by the company, the number of bookings is increasing
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
In the case of travel bookings for the coming months, sales have increased significantly compared to the previous year, according to a study - even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
In spite of weak economic prospects, the German travel lust remains untouched according to a study.
In the winter-season bookings, the travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in sales compared to the previous year, as the German Travel Association (DRV) reported on Monday in Berlin.
According to the investigation carried out by the GfK market research institute, the number of accounts already increased for the autumn months.
For example, the sales increase of the travel agencies in October was around 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV reported.
The results are based on figures from the GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agents and is calculated for the total market.
The travel bookings made until the end of August 2008 were recorded.
Due to the weak dollar rate, travel to the USA was particularly required, the DRV reported.
In this respect, the increase in the number of accounts was about one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the local cities of the Germans, were particularly asked for destinations.
In particular, travel was high, said DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the increasing cost of energy and food, the costs are "better calculated for the customer than for the individual holiday organised."
Laepple said that money could be saved by consumers, among other things, through early book discounts or all-inclusive offers.
The summer months had also been very well booked, so that sales would again have increased compared to the previous year - although according to a further study the number of Germans taking a trip fell compared to the previous year.
My first time Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apras-Ski-Hits in the endless loop, beer from litre-crutches and celebrities in designer-Dirndln.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't actually have much in common.
She's a blonde, a TV presenter, and she's wearing a tailor-made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is second-hand.
But one thing connects us: hardly three minutes on the Wiesn, the photographers are already falling on us and cutting the memory cards fully - very flattering and that on my first visit to the meadow.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap Dirndl seems to fulfil its purpose.
As a Wiesn-Touri, and actually located north of the white root equator, the feeling of well-being in the act still remained limited until now.
But first arrived at the Theresienwiese, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks angry or embarrassed - everything is completely normal.
Strange look at the chocolate banana stand only takes my dandruff.
A minischer makes me aware that I had mistied the apron: "Left host free, middle virgin, right hand-handed, back widowed."
In secret, I'm going to get the loop from the back to the left.
"Fits," said it and laughs.
Others make less effort on subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats on which "To drink to get dressed!" stands and stretch to an uninvited naked back.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is Bob, who comes from England and is also visiting the October Festival for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous," with a long-drawn "ooooooo."
This is what he tells me after he has taken away his previously drunk measure.
Right next to one of those hydrants, everyone thinks he's a trash can.
So Bob is one of those notorious "wildbiesler."
Others are not lucky to get rid of the alcohol in this way.
Around 8: 00 in the evening, paramedics run across the festive ground, which must take care of the poor swallows.
The nurses always appear in the pack - every four at once carry a covered bag from tent to tent.
This works like with most Wiesn visitors: Learn to go back, fully back.
You can't see who's in the promille coffin under the plan.
"This is what the goarnimmer pack," one of the paramedics called me on request and disappeared in the thunderbolt.
Name of the accident victim announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, living on Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to Queen's hospital in Romford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident for suspicion of light-minded driving.
In the meantime, he was released on bail.
Turkey expands the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey was seeking to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in penetrating deep into Turkey's hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, is one of the finest relics of this failed, imperial endeavour.
The Hydarpasha station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the travel guides tell you.
The building is located at the end of the platforms with a tower on each corner of the front and looks like some provincial German city hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building is about to fall apart.
But once you are within the vaulted ticket switch, there is no doubt about the majesty of the project whose most western access was.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Society.
Germany, which was a spatter in the imperialist game, had to implement before its ambitions to dominate the Middle East, by means of a train to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperialist projects were halted during the first World War.
His railway tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, created by the indelible limits of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces came out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syrie
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha train station.
In 1917 a munitions train flew into the air, with the artisan roof being destroyed.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has been slowly falling apart, far from history.
Today, however, this railway line, at least symbolically, serves as a gateway to Anatolia and all the east of it to highlight the extension of the diplomatic horizon of the Ttukei.
The ruling judicial and development party, the ACP, has introduced a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, created by the limits of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of rapprochement.
It is worth noting that the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian splinter groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to be able to assess the key data of this new foreign policy, I have taken the night train to Ankara, the Turkish capital, to visit one of the ACP's leading foreign policy experts, Mr Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy journey on tracks that produced the same step of the old world in the well-known documentation "The Night Mail," I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is seen as a new city, for the new secular state project, to turn my back on the Ottoman past.
However, the ACP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm change in Turkish unity.
This has caused a lot of mistrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi has brought me to the main office of the ACP, a specially designed, ultra-modern stone and steel construction, in a developing suburb surrounded by half-finished shopping malls and pubs in which medium-sized managers met in suits, both men and women, to complete the first shops of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-right politician of almost any other political party in Europe.
suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbours.
The Cold War was an exception, "he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Today she has to look east and west at the same time.
There wouldn't be either one or the other.
She'd have to do both.
"But certainly Turkey could eventually," I asked, "be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "did not want to have to face this decision."
He then pointed out a point that almost everyone I was talking to said almost routinely: Turkey's relations, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, in the transcribed sense, Europe as a whole can drive on the same rail tracks east towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha's station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German rulers, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched the building of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to know that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, be in the hands of Turkey.
And when I was waiting at the dock for the ferry to take me back over the Bosporus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe."
At the time, at least, there seemed to be not much doubt about which continent should have a right to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Chorus.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
He was meant for young people up to 21 years, but when the choir sang for the last time in 1979 some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological form changer) stood for the willingness and ability of the choir, any piece of music that was presented to him, whether it was a Madrid or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting and existed only thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never lasted for years.
How often did death stop us from "letting the music speak for ourselves."
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in the music.
So sing it! "
His type of conduction was absolutely clear and precise, never herrical but never overweight.
However high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the last 40 years, I have written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I was never disappointed by a single person - often I was inspired by them.
The death of Handley was that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He defied conductors who, according to his words, simply "went to haunt with one or two known poachers in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your call for William Woodruff (September 25), you write that "he took over the teaching of economic history in Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon-Norman research scholarship in 1950... while at the same time studying for a BSC, a MA and a PhD.
This is a conclusion from an author's note in Woodroff's book "Beyond Nab End," but it's not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during that time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the support of Professor J.D. Chambers, who was later published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry."
He was in the United States in 1950-1951 as a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover up this part of his career.

Second round of the excellent sale at Honda.
In November, Honda starts marketing the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large interior, this large-space limousine flows a much larger one.
In addition, there are also the technical fins that allow even more comfortable driving and saving of petrol.
Changes before the coming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made in this large limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics are to be stressed.
However, before you start analysing the new model, you have to say that this new jazz appears six years later after the first generation appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda managed to renew this model for a shorter time than the other producers.
Although Honda Jazz is less well-known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sale on the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the most sold car in 2002 and also in the course of 2008.
After the jazz appeared on the market, around a million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
However, Honda tries to increase the sale of the new jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83 000 models of jazz in 2007, the expected estimates are 10 000 cars, which is 17% of the expected growth in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 jazz models since 2002, which is 6.7% of the total sales to Honda in Spain.
As far as the new generation of the model is concerned, the leaders of the branches in Spain expect to be able to sell 2 000 jazz models per year.
More specifically, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model allows to cover up the sales reduction in Spain.
In reality, the brand leaders hope to complete the year with total sale of 22 000 models, which is 4 000 cars less than in 2007, a reduction of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared to the previous year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach the 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the appearance of a new model.
It is an Insight, a hybrid with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 meters, the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200 000 models a year around the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer's market estimates, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the rest is distributed across the Old Continent and Japan.
The appearance of the Insight on the market is planned for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz is growing in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has become 5 centimeters larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase of dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility programme and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the previous model of jazz.
The capacity of the trunk, which has a system of double loading, also reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres greater than the capacity of the first-generation trunk.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4-litre petrol engine, as the capacity of the Honda Jazz trunk with a 1.2-litre petrol engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, except for the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility of setting up panoramic windows, improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the rear doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz only 67 degrees.
The second generation of jazz engines are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of the petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which allows low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time provides high-speed power for the entire engine running time.
The first version with 1.2 litres is the power of 90 hp at 6 000 turns with maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min? 1.
This petrol engine - the previous model of jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 litres of petrol consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the previous engine, which reached 83 hp in the former generation, he now manages to reach 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litres of petrol consumption and 128 grams of CO2 output.
'Auto-bee 'that avoids collisions
In order to promote the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired by nature, more specifically by bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight is based on the swarm behaviour of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic car robot drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. 's technical development center have developed this small robot in cooperation with Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology at the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the head of technology PR and R & D fire management, the BR23C is an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety sign.
This robot is designed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid the collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds up its own oval-shaped flight space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the face eyes of the bee, which can see over an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, which allows it to fly undisturbed in its personal airspace without interruption.
The technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF) to demonstrate the overall perspective.
He notices obstacles that are located in front of the BR23C at a distance of up to two meters and are in the radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a on-board microprocessor, which is directly translated into signal for the prevention of collision
'In the moment the obstacle is noticed, the little robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change direction by turning its wheels around 90º or even larger angles to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference to other systems is that this evasive maneuver is absolutely instinctive.
If not, the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles, 'explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the laboratory for mobility and the leading engineer of this project.
In contrast to a bee, the robot can not deviate up or down, but also not oversee; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not into the infinite directions and in the infinite way that the bees make it.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and braking functions, so that the small robot avoids the collisions.
'This device only takes a few seconds to process the information and act according to this information.
It does not require neither the information nor the intuitive logic of the maneuvers carried out, so it can work continuously with just a few dozen KB of the space.
That sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs, it's not even about the MBs of the space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan has announced in the next ten years in the series cars.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and longer than the variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite to lead to the target while driving to avoid the obstacles on the way.
She's shaking before she gets burdened with a mortgage.
One must understand that the US Ministry of Finance, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide the support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and in order to avoid the US citizens being involved in mortgage stories of the supposedly affordable banks, a fun and informative game for the Internet surfers was developed: 'Bad Credit Hotel', it is said.
Or maybe, the hotel of bad credit or the reconnaissance.
The third aspect of this accommodation, and especially its receptionist, is to think one, two and up to three times whether it is the moment to ask for no credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
I'm sure she has useful information, but no details.
This is more of a side for the teenagers than a place for all the spectators.
What will happen when the game is extended?
Well, if a dream room appears at the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house.
Morgan Stanley makes their capital available for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its company, which would be the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of its capital, a new one, due to a strong case of its stock exchange rate.
One week after a preliminary agreement had been made public, the two banks declared that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's stock at a uniform price of $25.25, which will result in a total of $3 billion.
The price accepted is less than 19% of the share price of 31 August.
MUFG will invest additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares that will guarantee it a profit of 10% and can be sold again at a price of 31.25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley said that the world's business will be done on the basis of a single average price of 29 dollars, i.e. 28% above the current price.
The Morgan Stanley share, however, fell by 6.79% to 23.07 dollars at 17.00 GMT.
"This strategic link is an important opportunity to speed up the transition from Morgan Stanley to the status of a holding bank," said John Mack, Director-General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley accepted this status last week, which should allow him to extend their business to new areas, but under the supervision of the federal reserve.
Their connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the largest names of Wall Street to take a much more cautious stance than before.
The arrangements presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been changed over the last few days: last Monday Morgan had simply declared that it would sell up to 20% of its shares for about $8.5 billion to Japan.
'A week ago ', in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of the MUFG, said,' we thought that the participation would be entirely made up of tribal shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves. '
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below its price for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will go with a reduction in the profit by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that in one year MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential shares into tribal shares if the latter are exchanged more than 50% above the sales value within a given period, i.e. about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley assures that the money provided by MUFG will enable him to use investment opportunities, strengthen their balance sheet and increase their sales.
However, a group press speaker refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to record a payment capacity rate of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan said that he had 'significantly reduced' his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been hard for the group, which had to see how their exchange rate went down by half, while the price of the insurance against insolvency has accelerated.
This price went down on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other 'survivors' of the big investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced that last week, $15 billion, in part at Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republic around the socialism of the 21st century is restarting.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Equatorial Rafael Correa.
It was that third party who, following this Sunday, following the example of his like-minded and friends, made the plan of a new constitution a choice.
In the referendum, 64% voted 'yes', according to the public results of 80% of the votes.
According to these results, 28% voted 'no', 7% of the ballot papers were invalid and 0.7% were left empty.
In order to adopt the constitutional project, a vote must be reached more than half of all the votes cast.
On Sunday, two polls and a list of a non-governmental organisation had announced a clear victory for 'yes' and 63 to 70% prophesied to it.
On the night from Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa had called for the victory of his constitutional project.
The 'Constitution has triumphed in an overwhelming way', he had insured in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 km south-west of Quito and congratulated the Equatorial people.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which was held in silence in accordance with the observation section of the Organization of the American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points to secure the 'new socialism' for which the President is working.
The constitutional project transfers government power to the economy by leaving it the sole right to 'development planning' in a country that lives as far as possible from oil production by foreign companies and foreign exchange agencies, which send immigrants to the country.
The project, which is being promoted by the Correa chosen in 2006, also gives the head of state more comprehensive power, which will be able to exercise up to two successive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and will seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also guarantees the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already started to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
In the end, it also proposes to ban the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an equatorial base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the kidnappers of the 11 tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The 11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held in the desert for 11 days, were brought back to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon.
In the morning they were freed from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached the military base of al-Maza, right next to the international airport of Cairo, at 3: 30 pm on board a special aircraft.
They were brought directly to the Maadi hospital, a foreign district of Cairo, without being able to speak to the press, to be examined there.
They all enjoy 'best health' and the kidnappers' no ransom was paid ', said Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna on the field.
After being captured on 19 September at a road-car safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly brought to the nearest by 35 unknown kidnappers from a hiding place.
They are 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one rum - and eight Egyptians: two leaders, four chauffeurs, one border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, the organizer of the Safari.
One Egyptian security officer said that 30 members of the special units, from board two helicopters, started the attack at night, just before dawn.
'On both sides, shots were fired and half the kidnappers were killed, the rest of them fled, 'said this responsible person, who wants to remain anonymous.
He said that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special units had been sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commands.
The head of the Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is now, on the role, the secret agents and elements of the Italian special units.
"We must recognise that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men from the secret service and the special units," he said without further details.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
On the eve of the war, the Sudanese army had claimed that a patrol had stopped a ground vehicle in which the kidnappers were found, of which they killed six, including the leaders from Chad, and two arrests.
The army declared that they were connected to a rebel group from Darfur, the Libération du Soudan-Unite movement (SLA-U), which immediately denied this movement.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is the central issue of the current campaign.
All the better.
But one area of our cultural life remains in oblivion.
Who will stand up and denounce the pathetic sums that are given to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or the national historical places that starve to death?
What politicians will dare to remind the Federal Government that it is neglecting its monuments and its culturally important buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, there are no right laws that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is providing EUR 3.5 million only for the restoration of the Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbours, the Constitution of their country states that the protection of the cultural heritage is part of the culture of the American, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all Members and all government districts, in a mutual vote.
In Quebec, in the association of the history societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers who are gathered in 211 history societies are working hard to deal with history, to save the numerous private archives with a few large ones, and to preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage, who protest with the power of despair, when supporters and decision-makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments national parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalisation, the Benelux countries want to take advantage of the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which was launched by the US financial crisis in turbulence: the three countries provide the bank and insurance institution, which also has branches in Hungary, with a total of EUR 11.2 billion.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands discussed this weekend at the highest level, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner of the European Commission's Competition Authority.
In the euro area, the Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been going on for a year, so decisions that are now being taken in the context of the Bank could have a precedent.
For the purposes of the decision taken on Sunday night, all three States are buying the respective shares of the Bank at around 49 percent.
The bank is likely to sell part of its shareholdings, in particular the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of the Fortis have started a steep valley trip last week, and in the second half of the week there have already been serious crisis scenarios.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is far too big for a bust.
The institution's securities fell by 12% on Friday to a 14-year-old rate.
Since January, the value of the shares has been down by more than two thirds.
Given the current share prices, the group's market value is EUR 14 billion, but according to management, this is unrealistic.
According to management, the USD 700 billion expensive American rescue package and the resulting uncertainty in the markets are due to the flow of the Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, the courses have increased slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed the new Director-General of the Bank.
The money institution was also looking for a private buyer, but there was no interest in a factual offer.
The Belgian government, however, was trying to calm down - no investor should tremble for his money, it was said.
There has been no panic among the customers so far, the bank's branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, the Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls it its own leasing companies.
Fuchs in the chicken stable
Because of a person's drug consumption, life and health insurance in America often refuse to conclude a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes that in any case link the use of the drug data to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we entrust the fox to the chickens "- the Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurance sets the fees and the payment amounts in the event of damage, depending on the state of the customer's health, and if the risk is too high, the insurance will not be completed at all.
In the past, the customer was sent to a medical examination and the contract was only concluded in the knowledge of the results of the investigation.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much more favourable method: based on the customer's identification number, he takes the data from the pharmacies for the last one and a half years, says which products were bought, and the program calculates from which disease the customer is suffering and how his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol lowering drugs, it would be possible to conclude that his blood fat level is untreatably high, which would automatically turn him into a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk ultimatator, so that insurance only has to do more paperwork, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medicines can be used for different purposes, such as against migraines and heat flashes, but also against depression.
The latter is, in the view of insurers, a high risk factor, while the above-mentioned one is not.
For the collection and processing of the data, own societies have formed, which, before they receive the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they have to do so by law, even though they have not yet been apprehended.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory studies and connect them to the data on drug use. This gives them an even more striking picture of the health of the patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, and control of their use is becoming more difficult at the same time.
While there is an own data protection law for health data, its impact is limited to health and insurance service providers.
The draft law has already been submitted to Congress, which would allow the authorities to control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is too little, so he wants to develop his program so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question is, of course, that the person concerned can hardly deny access to his data, as the insurance companies do not enter into a contract with him otherwise.
And so the chickens are quite somehow left to the grace of the fox.
Global food plan from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
After the European Union and India are both the leading trading partners of each other, this was the main issue in addition to other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today, the French-Indian Summit is also taking place, which mainly discusses cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
While the European Union recognises that India is an emerging, democratic power that should be given more voice and voice in international concerns, Member States have not yet been able to agree whether or not to support the permanent membership of New Delthis in the UN Security Council.
This question was not discussed at yesterday's ninth summit in Marseille.
The French President and current EU President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplat Javier Solana received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached to double trade over the next five years, i.e. to increase to over EUR 100 billion.
Given that the exchange of goods between 2000 and 2007 had increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this objective is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally incorporated into an agreement, so that air transport will also be used in the future.
By 2009, India would like to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim was to balance the current imbalance between the EU and India: while the Union is the partner number one India, New Delhi is only nine among the EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
Among these were the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, which both sides strongly condemned, and the convening of a UN conference was also held.
The Doha Round should also be concluded, with both sides guilty of failure.
The EU stressed its commitment to its energy and climate programme, which means that emissions of pollutants will be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
This also agreed with India, as well as with the proposal to reach a kind of global compromise at the forthcoming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
The price increase in food should also be combated, so both support the convening of an international conference on the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is today visiting the French capital, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, orders to French companies worth EUR 20 billion are expected for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to agency reports, the agreement is to be decided for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair expects more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries for the current event. They will spread over the 171,790 square meters of the fair and present more than 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of the event.
The subsecretary for the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented in the 264 square metres exhibition room "Punto Italia."
A press conference will follow next to the room structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion, figures, trends and perspectives around publishing in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of foreign writers' books is decreasing throughout the whole, but especially in the adult and youth sectors.
The small aircraft of the billionaire Steve Fossett disappeared a year ago.
The small plane of Steve Fossett, which disappeared on 3 September 2007 on a flight over the Nevada desert, was found.
The parts have been found on a high plateau of 3000 m high, in the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes area between the states of California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the aircraft.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completely defied the final doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been localized, on which a force was sent. Now we have the certainty that it is the plane with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found on the plane or near it.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The United States Road Safety Office (Ntsb) announced that a team was sent to the aircraft in Nevada a few hours after the aircraft was spotted: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett in Yerington had started a 3-hour flight in Nevada.
Yesterday also in California, not far from the border with Nevada, some of the personal objects of Fossett were found by a couple near their home to the Mammoth Lakes.
This is two ID cards called Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had conquered a place in history by a long series of records.
In 2002 he succeeded in the sixth run, as the first person to orbit the world ball in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he was flying around the world in a single flight without landing on a plane.
His record also includes an altitude of 15445 m above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A suv that falls out of the traditional schemata due to its original design and special line line line, the surface and its clear angles.
Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new breath into the sector with this offroader.
It is precisely because of its exceptional features that the Suv Glk's performance will be unconventional, which will be seen in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from 17 October.
This will also be the case in new dress, in the form of a 3D campaign - a novelty in the car sector in the backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort, which will be carried out in various phases, which will take the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, by 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in the form, with 3D glasses, which are distributed near the Corso Como, will give the whole of it a special look: the new Suv will thus appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will appear to emerge from the poster on which it is depicted.
The new Glk is then illuminated in all its details with the help of the Elumina8 technology in different moments in order to get back together as a whole.
There is no doubt that Mercedes's concern with this advertising is to introduce a new type of car advertising into this rather stereotype field.
But will it be possible to travel the interest of future buyers? We will see it.
Now it is clear who the Italian hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto - now they risk a ban on stadium
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls, for which all of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia," which has been travelling after the Italian national team for years and which, to be honest, did not cause any serious problems until recently.
There have never been any clashes with opposing fans.
The group's origin is in the right environment.
The conveyors are from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
Other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia met in Sofia.
They carry the Tricolori, on which the cities of the militants appear, but they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, there has now been a clash with a truly right-wing, radical fishing scene, that of Levski.
Of the Figc, 144 cards were made available to the Italian fans for the game: all were shown on name and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were all controlled by the Viminal: no one was in a state ban procedure, among those who went to Sofia.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already preloaded in this respect, were thus also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the Bulgarian police reports to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified in the evangelitions can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban which prevents access to the stadiums throughout Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Thank God.
But now, of course, there is fear of imitation men who could follow this little more than 150.
"This fire must be stopped immediately, and this does not in any way give such a behaviour the possibility of justification" it is said from the Viminal.
Therefore, "eyes on especially with a view to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
Because in fact there is a small core of Italian Ultras in Apulia.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio (sports supervision), on Tuesday, the cash, which can count on part of the Aise, that is, the secret services that deal with the problem of stadium power.
"Duce-Duce Rufe and the raised right arm during the anthem of Mameli? This is not a crime in Bulgaria..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (clearly expressed in no joy), who has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the post of Francensco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Before that, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where a core of the supporters of Ulus Italia, founded in 2002, came from.
It is true, says Mazzilli, that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but the behaviour of these 150-200 people was undoubtedly a shame.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the number 1 of the Osservatorio - crimes are being punished in the country of their action.
So far, this group has been in control, but now it has to be considered what has happened and will happen.
But we also talk about the peppers during the hymn of Mamelis: even this is not a crime, but they allow me, because education is missing.... "
