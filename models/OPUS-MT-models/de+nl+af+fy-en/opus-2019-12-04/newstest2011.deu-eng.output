What is she supposed to do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither the Voldemort nor the "confectionery."
The new leaders of the capital of the ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The newspaper Aktiálně.cz has once "knocked off" members of the new Council of the ČSSD, as they control the notorious serpent that has taken place in recent years, in which today's coalition partners in Prague were at the helm.
The encoded vocabulary introduced by the Prague political elite in the unlocked era by Mayor Pavel Bém is the result of some of the most well-known actors, situations and Causae.
Surprisingly it was shown that the new councils are somewhat in the dark with regard to these new terms.
At least that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I am more of a newcomer in Prague politics," Lukáš Kacký, the new President of the Council for Culture, responded to the test of the "Pat vocabulary."
But also the councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, the term "Golfloch."
"This is the only expression of those you present to me here that I use every now and then."
"Otherwise, I don't think much of a snake."
From the vocabulary published this June in the journal of the ODS, the editor picked out six terms, especially those that are notoriously linked to the Prague Magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort," "the largest Prague Golfloch," "go into the confectionery," "bullneck," "betrayal of the capital," and "bleaching."
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised his participation in the conversation first, but then did not even take off the listener.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things and how the civil democrats talk to each other, I don't judge them."
"It is important to me how we understand each other in our programmes," he said.
As already indicated, in the above-mentioned headline, Lukáš Kaucký would not have known that the influential entrepreneur and friend of the ex-mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek, is speaking.
The term "Voldemort" says Kucky nothing at all and the only term he correctly learned during the test was "the largest Prague Golfloch."
"This is the tunnel Blanka," says Kaucký, but added to the safety: "But I know this more from the newspaper."
And it's a joke, "I'm going to have to do a language course."
The "Golfloch" is then properly deciphed as a tunnel Blanka not only by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the President of the Council for the Environment Lukáš Plachý.
But both Social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for and Lukáš Plachý even knows where to find this figure and what it means to "go to the confectionery."
"I think that means going into some Prague restaurant business," Plachý is pretty close to the puzzle solution when you know that this is the seat of Janoušek's companies.
In line with Březina, however, he is asking that he have taken this knowledge out of the newspaper rather than that he would own this vocabulary.
According to the test participants, there does not seem to be a similar-born snake among the Social Democrats.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is no such thing in us."
"We call by name, sometimes we also use shortcuts or nicknames," says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - called "Hulda" by his fellow parties.
"At school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Spatálně.cz has tried the name and see there - it works.
Councillor Weinert is friendly to the parties' "Grandpa" or less friendly to the "Old," the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to the party's sponsorship before the elections, is called "Igráček" (well-known Czech Lego figure).
The best names are the only ones that the S & Ds allow in the inner-party language use.
Hulínský does not like to call him "Hulda," but Deník Spatálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of the Gummikoppel Rights" is allegedly related to the fact that Petr Hulínský acquired his title Doctor juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and issued a brochure
In Burkina Faso, women who are classified as witches, usually have a number of common social characteristics.
They are more of an older generation, they do not find work - for health reasons, for example, they are single and have no children.
If one of these women "becomes a witch," she is strictly isolated so that she can't be dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are very rarely affected by this fate."
"Young and healthy women are also spared this because they help to work and give birth to children," a religious sister describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special home of more than one hundred women who have been expelled from their communities.
The local government now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure."
And for this reason issued a brochure to stop the "persecution of witches."
The thing is, it's got a hook.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper "the Standard" pointed to the dilemma of written enlightenment.
But to be accused of witchcraft is also going and going in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - they poured them with petroleum and just lit them up.
The BBC server also reported on this incident.
The perpetrators, however, claimed that the matter had only been a meeting of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version, oil was inflamed, which is used for ritual anointing.
And that is, after the group tried to "expel" a bad spirit from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" support people here without regard for their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Eaters of human souls are a danger earlier than today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to disarm the witch hunt, the Gambian President has been very involved in the President's last year.
"President Yahya Jammeh, after the death of his aunt, unraveled a monstrous witch hunt, as they allegedly had a share in their death and would now try to kill the President himself by black magic."
"To this end, he called for the help of Shaman from the near Guinea, who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the President's bodyguard, were violently abducted from Gambia villages and brought to the President's farm in Kanilai," said Amnesty International in her report.
On the farm, the incarcerated people were forced to drink an absud of plants with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the people arrested did not survive the stay on the farm.
It was only because of international pressure that the almost a thousand prisoners were released again.
A tenant of Bakala: He does heat in the oven - yet he pays higher rent
An older man is just leaving the client center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal baron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a folder with three new rental contracts for three apartments: for the own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is currently serving a sentence.
All three were just increased in the context of the so-called "deregulation" the rent.
Instead of 3500 kroner monthly rent, the son is to take up next year for a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category 4100 kroner.
"And there is not even a flowing hot water in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal oven," he tipped his finger on the new lease of the son, for whose signature he has a power of authority.
"But what - I have signed," he explains, half-in-all and half-in-all-in-all.
The citizens' association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new terms and conditions "incorrect and immoral," advises the tenants to simply not sign the new contracts and wait until 7 December, when they intend to publish a guide on how to deal with such contracts.
But the man just turns away.
"One says this, the other says that," he makes a dark face.
The region of Ostrava is thus becoming the great "deregulation laboratory."
After New Year's, this deregulation is ahead of most of the rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have not yet paid market-friendly rent.
At the end of the year, the "laboratory" was the first to visit this laboratory.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday is full.
The bodyguards of a security agency are right next to the door, and there's a call-up machine on her.
"Rent 2011," a special touch field on the touch screen shines.
A short tipped and already the device spits out a number.
We have hardly deciphed the number "157" and already beeps it on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting area.
Half a second later, it's your turn.
A little later, an older couple enter the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the rush in the waiting room does not seem to apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance issues and similar.
From mid-November, in the region of Ostrava, the new rental contracts have led the majority of the tenants of the total of 44,000 apartments of the RPG portfolio into the mailboxes.
The RPG Byty proposes to them in the letter an increase of about 15 to 38 percent.
The special switch for the new rent in the client centre has been open since November 18.
"The action is going on for over a week, that is, that's just the beginning," the ladies behind the switch respond to hesitation after a moment when the "client" turns out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former mining apartments are a brilliant issue.
Before the elections, Vice-President Lubomír Zaorálek of the ČSSD had taken up this issue quite loudly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"Not even a beech. They were able to change toilet glasses," the man mentioned at the beginning is getting air.
To date, employees have been mainly on the switch for pensioners to see if they really get the promised rental discount that RPG promises them when they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants who sign the new lease will also benefit from a half-reduced February rent.
So far, however, "deregulation switch" in Havířov is anything but overburdened by questions.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 were because of here," the switch officers estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on its websites as well as wall boards where it seems necessary.
However, if the rental parties do not agree on the new rent, they will be determined by an independent court.
"This is not to be a threat, but to be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach," explains RPG on its website.
"No one goes to court here," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the client center at least partially gives her the right.
"I have 13,000 (kroner) pension, of which 5,000 are left for dinner, where should I take the money for a trial," he says.
Then the employee becomes unsure.
"Let's see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media that they should not sign and so people are still waiting," she says.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic for New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, the rental increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing level of rent is not even sufficient to maintain the housing fund," says Pavel Klimeš, the director of the company's housing portfolio RPG Byty and - precisely the neglect of the housing fund, which was criticised by the tenants, is the main reason for the rental increase.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in the apartments in the years between 2005 and 2010, it is expected to be 5.2 billion in the four years 2011 to 2014.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered armchairs in the Havířov waiting room, a few red light-up information always appears.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less concern 31 200 apartments, that is, more than 90% of RPG's apartments."
"This always means a maximum of CZK 7,50 per square metre and month," is to be read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from RPG's portfolio increase the rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is about increasing extremely low rental prices of CZK 19.66 per square metre," RPG argues.
For 2600 apartments, the rent will remain at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not lead to the increase in rent but will take place gradually within four and eight years.
What more - the company imposes another obligation: all revenue from the rental increase (see diagram) wants to put the company back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in heat insulation.
But - the priority is to benefit those who sign the lease agreements.
The architects looked in - the office also includes a kindergarten
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new seat of the company Ar.Designs.
But who would expect a mini-kindergarten here, with all that belongs to it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to the employees of Arch.Design for the past year.
The project and architecture office Art.Design, whose studios have a whole series of well-known Brno buildings, was calculated from the first designs for the new Avriopoint building with the premises for its company mini-kindergarten.
In a wise perspective, because most of his 90 employees are in the baby tree age and the company is about to return to their work as soon as possible.
Together with the possibility to work shorter, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer to its employees in the concept of their social program.
The construction engineers have so much easier to bring together their demanding profession and child care.
The mini-kindergarten is an original idea of the employees of Arch.Design and with the support of management they managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operating mini-kindergarten is financed by the Human Resources and Employment Policy Operational Programme from the European Social Fund and from the Czech Republic's State budget.
This funding (CZK 2, 8 million) enabled the necessary facilities and equipment to be provided and for the duration of two years qualified staff and the operation.
After the use of the funding (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue to operate the mini-kindergarten for 3 more years at its own cost.
The preparation of this project took place a whole year, with the company Economy Rating providing strong support in the process of processing the application.
The children are fully qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can visit children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And as this is a mini-kindergarten, at the same time only 5 children may be present, but the day is changing over several children.
The kindergarten business is flexible to the needs of parents, the children of all employees have the same rights with regard to the use of the kindergarten - without prejudice to the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is individual education and care, the content of the programme in the mini-kindergarten is still comparable to the pre-school framework programme.
The children are not only playing here, they are especially offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to pre-school education, and they are also learning English.
The classroom is equipped not only with toys and creative games, but also with a computer available to the children.
What more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
The parents can take a look at the children at any time and so the stress is removed when the children are picked up late from a far away kindergarten.
Parents therefore use their working hours more productively.
No wonder that natural and loyal employer-employee relations are also developing here.
Arch.Design thus joined the Czech companies, which offer significant benefits in the recruitment of new employees, which are family-friendly and through such programmes support their human resources marketing.
A bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Look at the interior of Gaudi
The roof is like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are torn up fish mules.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
Of the local inhabitants, the house with its organic forms was named "Bone House."
Organic forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile splits and mosaics, which remind of scales of facades and omnipresent soft lines, all these are typical features of the youth style of Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the house plays with dreamy lines, tender colors and textures that remind of nature and living beings.
It is only when you see more clearly that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thought-through order.
During the night, the whole facade is even more plastic, dramatic and the special lighting strengthens the shine of the colors.
The same swinging lines and entangled forms also control the interior of the house.
Wavy shaped wood copies the window frames, railing, decorative elements of doors, even holes and bars.
The House Batlló in the Eixample district on the lively shopping street Passeig de Grácia no. 43 was created by the conversion of a house from 1877, which architect Emilio Sala Cortese performed.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep Batlló, originally insisted on the demolition of the old building and the construction of a completely new building, but in the end he agreed to the idea of Gaudís for an unusual and even cheaper conversion.
The Casa Batlló rental house, however, did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the representative apartment of the reality owner and the use of mosaics on the façade were created on his board.
However, many other artists and artists also worked on the design of the façade.
The joint work on the draft Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
For example, Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí's house Casa Milá in the park Güell, where there are also other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after it was completed, the house was given by the local inhabitants of its organic forms because of the nickname "Bone House."
Others in turn called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "looking house."
It is also said that at the top of the building is the sword of Saint George, the patron of Catalonia.
But also other sculptural elements symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed for the house a central heating system, unique for the time being, with ventilation channels and typical fireplaces.
A little bizarre already mutates her 45-degree inclination.
In his work Gaudí consistently ignored all the construction regulations at the time and was not allowed to be accompanied by them.
Before the construction began, he obtained the corresponding building permit from the city, but the information he made about the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later the city fathers were so disappointed at the result that they asked for help.
Among other things, the Council's leaders also met with the fact that the construction with its pillars even intervened in the public sidewalk.
However, there were no changes, on the contrary - only 15 days after the request of the district in this respect, Josep Batlló made an application to authorise the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and it was given to him promptly.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a social lounge, on the third floor were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building runs through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the conversion removed all right angles and straight lines and replaced them with curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for the mutual connection of rooms.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the salondoors, so a larger society could easily chat without having to renounce a certain intimacy in more confidential conversations.
The house was given a rather unusual roof and two other floors, in addition to a new façade, by Gaudí's conversion.
It is also impressive to play Gaudís with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is dressed and the courts of light.
The game of these two colors gives all floors of the house a maximum of light.
He simply made use of the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colors that absorb the sunlight on the contrary.
The house Casa Batlló, which was included in the World Heritage List of Unesco in 2005, can be visited by anyone today.
On the first floor, the most spacious and beautiful apartment is made available to the public.
The house owners only decided to take this step in the year on the occasion of the 150.birthday of the famous Creator.
When it was found that this is a quite one-off business, the visits were kept, but they were also extended to other common and the attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the building is not a piece of paper, it is 16.50 Euro, students, pensioners, groups and owners of tourist certificates get 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entry prices for other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, you should try to make friends with one of the residents and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rust? Women have different wishes than men
Not the most amazing bed frame, but the quality of the berth - so mattress and rust make the good bed out.
These must, however, be complementary in a harmonious way in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
Many things play a role in the selection - the weight, the size, the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the sleeper.
The interior, in which mattress and rust have to be subordinate, is equally important.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where it is not regularly heated, latex mattresses are not well suited as they need much longer to "get warm."
In addition, they are significantly heavier than usual polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be used regularly.
If they do not have enough ventilation channels in the core and are still on a solid plate, then moisture will be stopped: so it is not excluded that under their mold forms.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are used to.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with a soft layer are common, will be able to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
"I think all the hockey players who came back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep right here anymore."
"For their shredded shoulders, heels and hips they simply need a soft layer of visco foam (Memory Foam - a form memory polymer)."
"I also recommend these, among other things, to people with diabetes who suffer from a disturbance of the nervous system, so that they can receive the" information "from the joints and the skin badly," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstery furniture.
That's why I got many ice hockey players years ago, but also other customers to get these mattresses with visco foam (Memory Foam).
"This is no longer a problem today, because such mattresses offer, among other things, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't necessarily have to be a famous hockey player to appreciate the benefits of the visa show.
This "miracle" actually works very easily.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it is right on the warm body.
Nowhere does it press, at night you don't roll around like after a heavy fight.
You just sleep much better.
The fish-cold foam also offers protection against debubus (wound fire).
When choosing the mattress size, you should still add the length of the soles to the body size, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Man and woman, who are 180 cm tall, need a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the sleeper should be at least 90 cm in length, so together 180 cm in length.
For single beds, for example for single beds, 120 to 140 cm are suitable.
For the sake of comfort and also for possible visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal bed width: "If you are on your back, there should be enough room for the easily applied arms," says Ing. Helena Prokopová, the female master of the upholstery and space-makers, who has been devoted for years to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture and who also presents this issue in technical schools.
When you have a double bed, you need your own rust and your own mattress, but watch your shopping, so that the mattresses are also the same high.
Otherwise, there is nothing else but to mount the rust at different heights and this is not possible for any bed frame.
Sum mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should be the shape layer and the fine padding.
"You can't feel the feathers by your hand or by sitting down," says Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special rust type.
All-padded beds with mattress and base such as together-grown siamtwins have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the connection cannot be washed, which is already going on and on today.
And as one loses a single night between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and clogged sieve).
This is also why professionals reject advertising slogans who promise a lifetime of up to 25 years, even life-long warranty for mattresses.
Every thing has its If and But.
And therefore a practical advice from the traders: In mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width one should not be afraid of the hygiene of washable, removable covers, yet it is recommended to use a mattress cleaner, which one can easily pull off and wash.
Even though mattress covers are usually made today with round-length zipper, so that after opening you get two halves (very important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially performed alone, often as the unequal fight between David and Goliath.
Do they have a solid plate in bed instead of a rust?
Get it out!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
In this way they should use the plate with ventilation holes (if not already in it) and mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket springs and fine padding.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a base.
For non-adjustable lattice rust with 14 to 18 spring (lamels), latex or sandwich mattresses are suitable (possibly also combinations of latex and coconut), always pay for rust with a larger number of lats, i.e. 28 or more spring bars, with Lorcan support in the lumbar vertebra area and the possibility to regulate the latte hardness.
No mattresses with spring skeleton are included on adjustable lamellar rust, as they do not respond to ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to the adjustment of the stiffness of the spring bars, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This is about a special attachment of the spring bars, which allows to press the spring bars or even to bend them in such a way that they allow the shoulder of the sleeper to fall.
It's an important thing for men with wide shoulders.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started to use soft zones for the shoulder area in "men's mattresses."
The ladies are also thought of - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For most demanding customers, point-elastic wing spring systems (Lattoflex) or rust with point-elastic contact pads with so-called multitorsion suspension are determined.
The pressure is distributed to several points, thus reducing the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too large and full) pillow for the right mattress and the right rust, most benefits are lost again.
Here too a rule of thumb: the head cushion should support the head, its tips should only reach the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideal therefore appears to be a 50 x 60 cm pillow, such as the Scandinavia.
In the side position, the head cushion (along with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Something our modern mattresses have in common with the former straw bags (filled with hay).
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their mixtures.
The new magic word is also called "organic."
Instead of oil raw materials, natural oils - for example, castor and soya oil - are increasingly used for the production of polyurethane foam.
Soy is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Organic is called" mattresses, "which are made up of materials of pure natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček of the company Tropico Plus.
However, natural materials are also used in the production of mattress products - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
But you can also enjoy microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender fragrance when you sleep.
Here, too, one makes a difference between man and woman.
While men use a "cooling" plant extract from birch leaves, so that the mattress cover can absorb the heat and cool the body, the covers for women have "heating" effect.
Extracts of red peppers stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex gets warm while sleeping.
And today's favorites?
Mattresses made of cold foam (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and much more flexible).
The combination of the various stiffness (hardness) of cold and visco-foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hip and heel are.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have 7000 crowns and more to catch.
However, health mattresses are usually subject to lower VAT, as they are considered as medical aids.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to benefit from this advantage.
It's not that easy to save on the mattress and on the rust.
Every now and then there are special offers from manufacturers and traders who offer two mattresses at the price of one.
The Magniflex brand offers the Duofreeze mattress with a reinforced visco foam memory for 11.990 CZK.
You get the second one for free.
It was the material Tempur that introduced the era of fish-cold foam with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic speed.
No wonder they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overload at the start.
Tempur becomes soft in heat, in a cool environment it in turn solidifies.
Thus it perfectly adapts to the human body and distributes the body's pressure in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal for the prevention of pressure fire, but generally increases the sleep comfort.
However, fish-cold foam materials are used not only in mattresses but also in other health products, such as special foot pads, which are intended to facilitate the legs and the vessels.
For example, local manufacturers use the foam substances Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want people-surveillance devices to control the kids
The fear for your own children is growing and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them by GPS.
The system, which was originally invented to be used for the search for cars, is as good a place to find people, which would be helpful in such cases as it was recently when the nine-year-old Anička Janatková disappeared without a trace.
The device is currently about as large as a cigarette box but soon it will not be larger than a wristwatch.
Many people have put the case of the missing Anička in fear and terror, so they look for ways and means to protect their children better.
Also for the price of an impairment of their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about respying, but about an effective means of reducing the likelihood of the tragedy," says Petr Pilin from Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that in individual cases there may be abuse of such equipment, for example if you put it in someone's pocket without him knowing about it, but we have not seen such a case before."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," adds Pilin.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know the purpose of the "box" and how to use it in an emergency.
However, the child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, it will simply get rid of him.
"Even very small children show great creativity when it comes to the deliberate loss of certain things if they do not want to be controlled."
"At the beginning, the mobile phones were already very much expecting parents, but they can be turned off as easily as these new surveillance devices," said Mrs Bočková.
In her opinion, it is also controversial whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In the case of planned kidnappers, the kidnapper practically always checks whether the child has any electronics with him that could be used to locate it."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such surveillance devices were to be used more widely, they would also be looking for them, as their sale would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals of the police are always a step ahead," says the psychologist.
However, it acknowledges that similar devices can be quite helpful in the event of a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to the company RC Monitoring, Roberta Čech, which offers location services for both cars and persons, can help the existence of such a device even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be set in such a way that it reports the position at certain intervals."
"Even if it was destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the data subject is available."
"In the case of more expensive devices, even a tilt meter is integrated, that is, if you fall down and remain motionless, the device immediately sends a warning indicating the position," says Mr Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also provide intelligent mobile phones with navigation, but only a special software is needed.
The problem with the current locator is that it is either a match-size device that resembles trailers or a smaller cell phone.
There's always a risk of losing it.
According to Mr Pilin of the Macro, it is therefore in the present time that we test devices that look like normal digital watches.
"This has the advantage that the possible attacker does not have to know at all that it is a monitoring or tracking device.
"Or he will only notice after a certain time what gives the police a time advantage," he adds.
No matter what direction the development is in - to bracelets or trailers, the same technology is always used as in the vehicle location.
So the combination of location function using the GPS system (as well as the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many spark belts that you could wrap all over the Czech Republic but only hold you for two years
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometers of ignition lines, are fired with explosives.
In the year before, the Ministry of Defence had already delivered a line of 224 kilometres to the Army.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have taken care of 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cord - two, but not more than four years.
The army bought the ignition cord from the public limited company STV Group, a.s. for leaping 40 million crowns.
In its reason for buying this huge amount of ignition cord, the general staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would use the 60 km of ignition cord every year.
According to the research of army pyrotechnics, which MF DNES referred to it, it is clear from this statement that the entire army must have an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all the general and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and cleaning women.
Minister of Defence Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
This is the only way to justify the considerable annual consumption of 60 kilometres of ignition cables in the medium term.
This length, by the way, corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But this would also be enough for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts still applies that for the training of each new professional soldier, two metres of ignition line is sufficient, then the army has created a calming stock for the 225 years already mentioned, also in view of the increased needs of the pioneers and special units.
At the same time, soldiers of the Rapid Operations Brigade recently complained to the Minister of Defence Vondra that they had almost no more cartridges for hand-gun weapons, so that shooting exercises of the missing means were severely restricted.
Not to mention the lack of underpants.
"I don't understand why they're buying such a lot of ignition cables from us."
But that's their decision, they'll know what they need. "
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we as a dealer want to meet as much as possible," says the sales manager of the STV Group Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, is the reason for the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of ignition line that the army had so covered itself with this "ammunition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group only talks about a four-year period of use of the ignition belts and police and army pyrotechnics only for two years.
"In the case of perfect storage, the four years mentioned are possible," one of them admitted, but he wants to remain unnamed in order not to be accused of the criticism of the army as a soldier.
After the time of use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested, whether it is still reliable and not at risk of the lives of the soldiers.
But these tests are not for nothing, but they cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantity discount for the 445 km ignition line.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's supply of 244 kilometres," Speaker Pejšek tells us the point of view of the Ministry of Defence buyers.
Only for comparison: the annual consumption of the ignition belts of police pyrotechnics, which liquidate ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Brotherhood Army, for a few years has not been more than 1,500 meters.
And the police always order the quantities of this ammo that it can use before the end of the time of use.
Because of the safety of the pyrotechnics, the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and therefore reliable ignition cables is also kept open.
The Ministry of Defence has in any case huge problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Treaty when the two hundred thousand-head Czechoslovak people's army prepared for their campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics, which addressed MF DNES, the Czech forces in a few years will expect the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometres of old ignition lines, which it has bought today so "cheap."
To date, I have been given the contacts that I have won thanks to the competition
The winning position in the competition "Small Business of the Year" helped Lukáš Pytloun to sell the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of the last year of the competition "Small Entrepreneurs of the Year" was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success is like a film scene.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
Only abroad did he realize that Liberec lacks good accommodation at reasonable prices.
From the savings of his holiday work abroad and with the help of a bank credit he obtained a house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a university student at the time in the sixth semester, this was certainly a brave operation.
"The price-quality relationship at that time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment he rented to foreign workers.
He immediately invested all the profit back in the house, which he then converted step by step to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has been able to open four pensions, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories in just seven years.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star hotel "Pytrun Design Hotel."
This year another first-class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties in the franchise of the Pytrun hotels have already signed up," says the entrepreneur number one last year.
"A large part of this sale of license to operate hotels has just had the victory in the competition" Entrepreneur of the Year, "added Mr Pytloun.
The victory has brought him greater knowledge, indeed popularity in Liberec and surroundings.
"People recognized me on the street, often even congratulated me afterwards, and I must say that was really good," he remembers.
I really recommend to all those who want to make a move to participate in this competition.
You don't have to win right away, any visibility is good.
He says that to this day he is taking advantage of the contacts and acquaintances that it would not have come to at all.
"I have regular business relations with some people I have met thanks to the competition."
In his opinion, the fame associated with success is also a little on each of his employees.
And there he is on the seventy.
"I note with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that is given general recognition."
I really do not only see this as a personal success, no, that is the result of the good work of all of us. "
"My name has only come to the fore," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had in Farmet
The victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his goal, Farmet has the worst thing behind him.
The prize for the first rank of the Vodafone company of the year last year was received by Karel Žďárský, the company owner of Farmet.
The jury then appreciated the efforts he made in the small tool building in Česká Skalice to stem a company from the ground that makes hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this assessment not only encouraged myself, but also all my employees and strengthened our self-confidence in the fight with the competition," says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of the company history of Farmet was the effort to do something useful.
And when the state offered to his father Karel Žďárský as compensation for the property seized by the Communists a small workshop for rent, he did not hesitate long, left his career in the company where he had been working until then, and with a few comrades of his father founded his own company for the production of plastic tubs.
They started to concentrate on the oil press.
Within 18 years, they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses throughout Central Europe.
But it is only through the success of the mentioned competition and its medialization that it has also entered into the awareness of the non-professional public.
"Not only that our customers are now significantly more aware of the Farmet brand, but also our foreign partners began to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country," says Karel Žørský.
The past year, however, was not only in the sign of the victory euphoria at Farmet.
The assessment was based on the economic results of the company in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just in 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products.
The crisis, which at that time shook citizens, but above all companies, just reached their peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and to limit the purchase of new institutions and technologies.
"Of course, we could not miss this situation either."
"The sales went down by 40 percent, we had to limit production and even get rid of it," explains Karel Žďárský
A viable company may also have to take such unpopular measures.
However, it was possible to control the situation and keep the company in black numbers, even with less profits than before the crisis.
One was the company not willing to make cuts - in terms of investment in research and development.
"From the grant we built a research and training centre, we strengthened our presentation at international fairs and acquired main prizes at domestic exhibitions," says Žďárský.
It all shows that we have overcome the crisis.
The sales are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a great deal of joy in victory - but in a more quiet atmosphere," says Karel Žďárský.
A public opinion survey that will clear up with insinuating regulations
The opinion poll on the "absurdity of the year" is part of the business competition for the fourth time.
Some dissenting regulations have already been able to get out of the world.
The dubious winner of the next year's opinion poll "absurdity of the year" was the duty to create documents on authorities available online.
For example, more than one third of not quite four thousand voting entrepreneurs decided.
The social security administration asked for a paper extract from the commercial register, even if the official could have called it by two mouse clicks.
This is now changing thanks to the opinion poll.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will in future no longer require any extracts from the trade register in the case of controls on social security payers," said ČSSZ Jana Buraňová's spokesperson.
The purpose and purpose of the "absurdity of the year" opinion survey is to examine all the rules and regulations, to meet the economic operators in the Czech Republic and to lift the dissenting ones.
This year, this is already part of an enterprise competition organised by the Th. WirtschaftsZeitung (HN) for the fourth time, and is enjoying growing popularity in the public.
If the three thousand people participated in the vote last year, it was already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that are only intended to hinder business activity.
"As regards, for example, the number of income tax forms, we take a leading position in the world," Karel Havlíček noted from the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and business operators in the Czech Republic.
The simplification of business activity has been the declared objective of all governments in recent years.
However, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved compared to the world.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is 74th in terms of business conditions, with eight places worse than the previous year.
The competition absurdity of the year was declared for the first time in the year and takes place every year according to the same scenario.
Everyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the end of the competition at the end of September.
The website address www.firmaroku.cz. After that, the organizer of the competition will select seven candidates for the "anti-price" and allow the public to vote on the website www.firmaroku.cz / absurdita and www.ihned.cz on the Internet.
It is the absurdity that is given most of the votes.
This year's opinion survey has already been notified to more than a hundred, more precisely 105 meaningless regulations and orders.
The tips are not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition, for example, there are provisions that maintenance vehicles have to pay for motorways and highways, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to be presented every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the pages of the competition.
The exclamation of the competition at the beginning of November at the Prague Wenceslas Square is part of a happenings in which people of political and public life regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small or medium-sized enterprises and commercial operators of the Republic of China and Petr Kužel, the President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic of China, were at the peak of the competition with the party.
"Where the state is throwing the entrepreneurs between their legs, there can be no real economic recovery, so my aim is to lift at least thirty paragraphs each year, which are still unnecessarily difficult for entrepreneurs today," said Martin Kocourek, the Minister for Industry and Trade.
The efforts to create dissenting orders from the world have been effective.
In 2007, people were most concerned with the business obligation to report to the commercial office at the place of their permanent establishment three days in advance the intention to go to an exhibition or to a church with an exhibition stand.
This obligation was abolished by means of a revision of the Trade Act.
The obligation, which received the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to report to the employment office missions of employees for up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them so-called "Green Card."
And - all good things are three:
The Regulation was chosen for the absurdity of 2009, which required physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two personal scales in the room.
This regulation has been somewhat reduced by the Ministry of Health this year - the cooling cabinet requirement has been dropped.
A new category honors socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, education or sport projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year of the competition of the business newspaper (HN) is the category "Responsible company of the year 2010."
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support companies that are aware of the consequences of your business on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone company Vodafon, the exclamation and guarantor of this competition, as well as the competition "Rebel of the Year."
For this year's first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafon company of the year, companies have signed up for which success is not the only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and offers enough material for an independent article.
Although they are diametrically different in terms of the subject-matter of their activities, their efforts still have a common denominator - support and consideration.
This is about disabled people, for example, because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera also appeared, which promotes the development of non-formal sports teams among their employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolt-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory from Poděbrady also takes good care of its health-impaired employees, which account for 70% of its workforce, for which it was awarded the title "responsible company of the region of Central Bohemia"; in the Vodafone company of the year, it took third place in the context of this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting company MiRyz Soft, which introduced, among other things, a flowing and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours a week, and without a relative wage reduction.
The jury also paid tribute to the fact that the company mainly buys from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens' initiatives in their environment and works in accordance with environmentally friendly principles.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible to minimise the impact of our business and administration on the environment," explains her CEO Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogite from the Ústí nad Labem region, in turn, is located in the health of its employees and therefore it has acquired them ergonomic armchairs and keyboards to all the notebooks, and it also promotes home work in its employees and in company actions it uses cartering services provided by a home-protected workshop.
"We also support the" People in need "Foundation, which provides concrete help to local Roma communities," says Ondřej Suchý, the company's representative.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlbadan region is also worth mentioning, which contributes to their pension insurance to their employees in the form of extra bonuses.
"We provide our employees with contributions to the food, the way they work, the increase of their qualifications and the holiday," says Josef Strapáč of the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
The category of responsible company of the year was automatically notified to all district finalists of the Vodafon company of the year, who answered the questions of the questionnaire submitted to the application and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrect or incomplete replies in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition" responsible company of the year, "but in the main competition Vodafone company of the year they were not disqualified."
"A separate application only to this competition is not possible, as it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Arrest of the police in a public call
In the building of the ground fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police have been taking arrests in the last few days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was derived from the detectives in handcuffs.
It was claimed that the latter had tried to manipulate a public competition that was currently taking place in order to deal with the rights of the reindeer in such a way that the land offered in the competition was of a specific interest.
This one is said to have paid Luboš G. half a million for it.
"At that time, I can only confirm that the police are following a person in public competition because of the delusion of fraudulent conduct," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner Public Prosecutor's Office of the "Právo" newspaper, which it cannot provide further details with regard to the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by the police.
In what way he could manipulate public competition, it is only possible to speculate on this in view of the limited official information.
The spokesperson of the Soil Fund Lubomír Černá referred to the question raised by Právo in this regard that the police had actually made arrests in the Pilsner branch of the Soil Fund, and during public competition.
"It was about a client, and it was not about one of our employees," she said.
According to the public competition, Mrs Černá had the correct name "call for the transfer of land rights under the Land Law" and would take place in cases where several applicants show interest in the land offered.
"These persons offer, in the context of the request, a higher value of their rights of substitution to be settled by the transfer than the value of the land used."
"In accordance with the claims offered, the order of potential acquirers is determined, and the land fund then transfers the land to the person with the highest offer," explains the representative of the Fund.
Luboš G. was obviously available with information on who had applied for the request and since he was himself a legitimate person, since he had bought a number of rights of substitution, he offered a land interest that he would withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat settlement.
That would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money in his arrest.
Luboš G. has had too good contacts with the Pilsner Soil Fund in the past.
He also played a role in the Causa of the former head of the Land Fund Václav Sankota, which was prosecuted in criminal proceedings because he issued in replacement refunds land on which site decisions on construction projects had already been made.
At that time, Luboš G. acquired land from the Land Fund, for example, for the construction of public roads, in the place where the construction of the access magistrate was planned to be part of the Borské pole commercial area.
Later he exchanged this very conveniently with the magistrate for a house right in the historical center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the land.
The city hall had to give a heavy heart in order not to endanger the construction project by blocking the land.
Household housing costs are up by a few hundred per month
As of January, households will not only have to expect higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher water and waste water charges and for district heating and in some places, rents are also growing.
As of January, families will have to pull several hundred crowns out of the wallet more per month than before.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and some places also increase the cost of district heating.
The price of the house is a few hundred kroner per year.
The high-electricity prices were reduced by all main suppliers, so it is a debt that is the clear promotion of electricity production from renewable sources, including photovoltaic systems.
Gas is only getting more expensive, but this is precisely when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
So here too we can expect a few hundred crowns more per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices of district heating vary from city to city.
Above all, larger places are planning price increases.
For example, the households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové have to pay up to 50 kroner per month from January onwards, more than 1000 kroner pay more per year families in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague are again at risk of 9% higher water and wastewater charges, in case the city increases the infrastructure rental.
If the rent doesn't change, it's only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague is still among the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In the northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and waste water charges are expected to increase by 7.4 percent.
A huge increase in rental prices is expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, where the so-called rental regulation will fall away from January.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which has 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase the rent by a hundred percent from January.
If you do not agree with this increase in the rent, the company wants to take a court interest.
The regulated rents that are still paid in almost 300,000 apartments are expected to increase by more than 10% next year.
Czech children get drunk with Fernet and rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, Rum and Vodka, for the most part a good whisky that the father was stolen from the house bar.
These are the drinks that Czech teenagers under 15 have to be treated most in need of treatment.
No exception are children who have to sleep their hangover repeatedly in the hospital.
This is reflected in the experience of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the reception of the children's departments of clinics.
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk."
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the chief of the children's department at the Central Bohemian hospital Hořovice.
"Whisky, if the father can get a bottle out of the house bar, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
"Vodka has the advantage that you can mix him with Juice, then he doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief.
The speaker of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová is right to him.
"Most of the time it's about distance or rum."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially in primary schools."
"It was also about Slibowitz, which was taken from home," said Ms Jurinová.
According to Chefarzt Pelikán, 13 or 14 year old drinkers are not an exception in hospital reception.
Before the hospital in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the Paediatric Department of the hospital Motol, where the ambulances were supplied with drunk students from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"She started her career at the age of 12 when she was first given 3.5% alcohol in the blood and in combination with" ecstasy, "the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the exhibition site in Holešovice at some dance party."
"The interesting thing was that it didn't seem strange to her mother that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief is surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance to start with their own people that is considered to be one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, there is no real dependence in the true sense of the word in children.
"Alcoholism is a long-term chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena, and this is not the case for these children."
For those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, a negative family-social background is mostly characteristic, "explains Chefarzt Pelikán.
According to Ms Jurinová, the speaker of the Motol hospital, some forty drunken children were admitted to the local Department of Paediatric and Youth Medicine until mid-November.
However, only cases of severe alcohol poisoning which required a hospital stay are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are brought home by their parents or, if necessary, by the police are not registered.
In addition to the cases where children only drink a bottle of schnapps in the school bank, Mr Pelikán considers that there are three annual amplitudes to which there is a hundred percent of leave: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either for sorrow for the bad testimony or for the joy of the holiday."
"On the night of the Walpurgis, I have already experienced seven drunken children at once in the recording," says Dr. Pelikán.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better at it than a child who has to fight only with an unpleasant hangover the next day.
The headache in the morning after that, which is due to dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be distributed in the hospital with a fluid-lowering infusion with glucose and nutrients that are missing from the organism.
"They are clearly better off, because after the" wonderful "experience in the evening, they wake up with good mood without any pain anywhere."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," Dr. Pelikán admits, and at least sometimes he makes the patient feel the good mood by adding to them the costs that they will cost the treatment.
Because the transport with the ambulance and the night in an acute bed come well and like to a few dozen thousand crowns.
"I used this as a means of education every now and then, when I pretended to the children at the visit, which cost their drunkenness and that it could happen that they have to work all the time on the holidays to make the money for a single such feud," added Dr. Pelikán.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance funds do not use regression procedures to demand the necessary costs for the healing of the drunken children from the parents.
Two training aircraft L-159 for the first time in a foreign hand - in Spain
Two light combat aircraft L-159 of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defence has exchanged for the transport aircraft Casa C-295M, flew to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is located.
It is the first time that machines of this type are in possession of a foreign army.
They have been seen abroad only at maneuvers or flight shows.
This is about the two-seater version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are one-seat L-159.
These are still in the Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - took over last week.
When she physically expeditions the aircraft from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, the spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, is not yet known.
The single-seat aircraft L-159 were, in turn, separated from long-term aircraft, without further deposits and investments from the Department's department.
"The double-sitting L-159T1 were replaced in the current state and appearance," said Pejšek, the newspaper Právo.
He added that the army would not have to come out without two-seat fighter aircraft, as the Ministry of Defence signed a 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 on the conversion of four redundant L-159 to the two-seat version.
A new plane took over the army in July, the second is going to take over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed itself to implementing the aircraft in the equipment of one of NATO countries.
"The Treaty clearly states that the EADS company is the customer of the L-159 aircraft and that they are to be used to train the NATO countries' pilots.
"It is therefore the responsibility of the customer in how he realizes the thing," Pejšek pointed out.
The business newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 against a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of other aircraft for 3.5 billion kroner had been approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not issue a tender procedure for the purchase at that time, but addressed EADS directly.
The then Defence Office argued that this exchange would support the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which only 24 were used, and the rest wanted to sell them.
By the way, the purchase of the Casa aircraft should also have a judicial follow-up.
The European Commission has brought the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice, which is why it should have chosen the aircraft on the basis of a whole-scale call for tenders and not by addressing a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three planes of Casa, the last is to land at Kbely Airport within 14 days.
A longer index finger than a ring finger means a lower risk of cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of suffering from prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is supposed to be related to the mirror of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially in men up to sixty," said the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the cancer research institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help to determine which men should be subject to a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health stress, Mrs Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3000 healthy men.
For more than half of the participants in the study, the right hand index finger was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the same probability of prostate cancer was observed as for 19 percent of those men whose ring and index fingers were equal.
However, in men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33%, and in men up to 60 even by 87%.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which already form in the prenatal age, clearly reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone is the one that accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, leading Czech genetician and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK was aware of this study, but he does not think the relationship between the finger length and the cancer risk is so far "completely proven."
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Just like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is under a snow ceiling on Thursday morning.
On the streets and walking trails is mostly snow that was fixed, the winter workers were on the axis all night long.
The D5 motorway between kilometers 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is closed for some accidents from trucks and cars and the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague "stands."
This said Novinky.CZ the Dispatcher of the Central Auto Moto Club (ÚAMK).
At km 91, a truck died, at km 93 two trucks came together, in this accident there were injured.
There are also a few cars in the road ditch.
There are also problems at km 185 of the motorway D1 in the direction of Prague.
Here too, two trucks have collapsed.
The drivers were to leave right behind Brno at 190 km or over Brno and to visit Kývalka at 182 km.
That's where there's a traffic jam for miles.
An accident also happened on the D11, and this was immediately on the way to Prague.
In Prague itself there is a several centimeters thick snow ceiling and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, car columns form in the town of Prosek, the road Štěrbohlská is also completely blocked.
The safest means of transport is at least the metro.
The tram runs with delays, for example on the line between Karlplatz and Peaceplace.
The Prague crisis team will meet at 8: 00 in the morning.
There are also problems with the railway and the airport.
The Czech state railway had to cancel seven rapid train connections due to snow traffic.
There are problems, for example on the Prague - Kralupy or also Prague - Beroun route.
It is essential that travellers are informed about the current situation.
Airport Ruzyně has been closed since Wednesday 11 am until 5 am.
Most roads in South Moravia are only accessible with increased caution.
Around Vyškov three side roads are completely inaccessible, in the area of Brno there are some snow movements and in the area of Blansko one is forced to use snow grass on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are still three streets completely closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here too one will have to use snow grass for the snow-clearing.
When they become reusable, it is not possible to estimate until now.
In the Hodonín region, caution is needed in the area of white carpathian.
On the roads, which can only be scattered with inert sprouts for nature reasons, there is one up to five centimeters thick snow ceiling, ČTK led.
In the Czech Republic, from two to ten centimeters of fresh snow fell, most of them in northern Bohemia - in places up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimeters of fresh snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it is slow to stop snowing.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon."
The American troops have used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, known only under their code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the power ratio to their benefit.
The new weapon is something like a super-accurate gun.
Their projectiles are directed to the target by laser with a meeting security of just a few meters.
The special shoots of caliber 25 mm, designed for this gun and containing highly explosive explosives, work practically as small grenades.
The shots can be programmed in such a way that they can explode not only when they impact on the target, but at any point of their ballistic trajectory.
That means you can use it against an enemy who is hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or in the trenches.
It is usually not protected from above, so the murderous steel splitter rain from above can easily put it out of battle.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new battle weapon is the first infantry weapon to use "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier basically acts like this: it's targeting the target and sending out a laser beam that determines the distance, so it wins an exact point of view after which it corrects the angle of increase, then it just needs to be printed.
"Let's say you've measured 543 meters."
"When you press it, the gun charges up and shoots the shot at the distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are being shifted
The Fujitsu Group is moving its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their work from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese group Fujitsu is moving its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant specialized in computers and their maintenance reported on Wednesday, in July next year 400 women and men will move their jobs from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad.
One speaker from Fujitsu explained that in the medium term there should be another 100 jobs for the group, which have so far been distributed across the region.
The rental offer had been extremely attractive, and the large-scale doors in Astro Park would be better suited to the operation of the employees.
In Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only a tenant.
The managing director Bernd Wagner said, "with Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The excellent connection to the airport is particularly important for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
The Frankfurter Wirtschaftsdezernent Markus Frank (CDU) said that this once again was a "global player."
This is a "great place to be."
Fujitsu passes to the city that the settlement is an important impulse for Lower Wheel.
The Bad Homburger Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city was informed early by the management of the intention.
"We have offered the company our help, of course," said Korwisi.
The friendly contacts, however, could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at Marienbader Platz.
In the end, economic reasons would have given the result.
Now it is about preventing a long space in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and owner of the building will be cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu on the Town Hall Square and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" were one of the most controversial projects of the city with the other buildings on the Marienbader Platz ten ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city entrance was created between the station and the city hall, which caused criticism both because of the massive construction of the previously used areas as a parking lot and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consultancy and credit rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, started Amadeus, and then the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still connected to Siemens.
The building used by Fujitsu was acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt German Real Estate Chance Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold to Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid a year later.
The Fujitsu-Konuzern, based in Tokyo, is the third largest IT provider in the world.
It provides companies, for example, with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The establishment in the Rhine-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has much more employees in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions is in Frankfurt-Niederrad, and the other subsidiaries at this site are to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
In the Astro Park office building, 7000 square meters were rented for this purpose.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name is based on its star-shaped plan - the central association has its seat, among other things, in the electrical engineering and electronics industry.
Amazon locks server - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is getting into a lot of trouble.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the display platform from its servers.
There may be political pressure behind this after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
Wikileaks founder Assange is supposed to be in England.
The Wikileaks unveiling platform is increasingly under fire in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman, however, called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on the Interpol list, is supposed to be in the UK after a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks from Amazon server is being replaced."
"Free speech in the land of the open," the unveiling activists reported by short-news Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in the publication of the secret diplomatic deputies in order to manage the high access numbers to the documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks explained on the step: "Fine - our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon had stopped the use of its servers by Wikileaks after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman had done research, the television station CNN reported on behalf of the office of Liebermans.
The president of the Senate Committee on Home Protection had threatened Amazon with a boycott, reported the British "Guardian."
"I would have liked Amazon to take this measure earlier in view of the previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks," said the Senator.
As a result, Lieberman called for the platform to be banned from using servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks' illegal, outrageous and reckless approach puts our national security at risk and endangers the world's life," it says in a communication from the partisan senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks to spread stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted for rape suspects by the authorities in Sweden, is on the Interpol list.
According to a report by the London newspaper "The Independent," the 39-year-old Australian in the UK is known as Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always referred to the investigation in Sweden as the intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there were threats.
"There were even calls after a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange is very afraid of his safety, said Hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore continue to be hidden.
Hrafnsson obviously responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had requested that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations be charged with treason and executed.
In Canada, a consultant from the head of state Stephen Harper - obviously ironic - said on TV, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
Between the White House and Assange, there was an exchange of sleep.
The spokesman of American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had called for the resignation of Minister Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recent espionage calls to diplomats.
"I'm not sure why we're taking care of the opinion of a guy with a website," says Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website."
The American government is now fully examining the protection of its databases.
The White House was appointed as the Special Representative of the Anti-Terrorism Centre, Russell Travers.
Travers was responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" that had become necessary after Wikileaks' disclosure of the message reports.
The White House also wants to have the way in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The American government also announced that it would want to ensure the security of dissidents and activists if they were to be put at risk by the Wikileaks release.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," said Foreign Minister Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if this is necessary."
The ice-cream university
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice-cream condators are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future citizenship has the largest entrance and visitors from all over the world.
Where did all the ice come from?
From the Gelatiere and the Gelataio.
The gelatiere, in German a little old of the ice-cream confessor, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-maker art.
The Gelataio takes the ice cream out of the cooling counter with a spatula, puts it in the waffle and then sells it.
To know that, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice cream, you won't pass the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The ice-cream university set up the manufacturer of ice-cream machines in 2003, so that the ice cream from its machines can meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future citizenship has the largest entrance and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also several days of special courses on chocolate ice cream and internships in the house's ice-cream hall.
Some dream of a new career in the Midlife crisis, others just go on the smooth ice of their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, California art teacher, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial ice cream.
Anke from Berlin is a company consultant and after years, wants to do something of its own in a nerve-raising job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice-cream hall in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
The decisive thing is not only good taste, but also silky softness and good consistency.
In his training, Luciano does not forget the creeping of national and even southern overbuilding: "Italian gelato is just the best - and then there is a lot of romance."
The first step towards production seems quite simple.
Luciano tilts the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer, which heat everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cool to four degrees.
Then he turns a cock on the machine, and out comes a pasteurised white base screen, basis for all milk ice.
The teacher is immediately overshadowed with questions: Can ice cream be produced only with natural substances without stabilizer?
How can one let one's own desire for experimentation free run?
Luciano warns against being misled by the spirit of time.
Those who talk of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guar-core flour from the guar bean.
Of course, you can make ice without a stabilizer, only then it has to be sold within one day, otherwise it will be packed together, and the customer will bite on a lot of ice grains.
Certain variations at the base mass are allowed.
It's getting more exciting with the flavors.
For the taste in the ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or in the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powder and pastures.
"The suppliers will all try to turn on dozens of flavoured additives."
"But you should just experiment."
The fruit sorbet with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or just with the ice cream from the white base mass, which becomes yellow cream with eggs and with cocoa powder as the basis for all possible chocolate seduction.
Now the students are allowed to go to the ice machines.
Luciano makes four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural additives.
The same experiment is also being carried out by the varieties of fruit ice.
More flavours, more fruit puree - this is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily taste more nutty when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi ice cream is produced by the working group, which uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
A balanced mixture is the only way to get the taste of a gelato right, says Luciano.
Ice production is a calculation task: If peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content in the basic concept must be reduced.
For lemon ice, an extraction of sugar is required.
Luciano draws up a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (the winemakers measure the oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables facilitate the invoicing.
Making ice cream doesn't require as much physical use as it used to be.
Not only the device for automatic production of the basic mass helps.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is simultaneously cremated and cooled to a minimum temperature.
In spite of all automation, small gaps are not left out.
The Brazilian Gustavo and his colleagues from the top to the bottom are covered with fruit puree, when the overdimensional stabmixer gets out of control.
"In every course," Maestro Luciano says, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Controllers in the twilight
The European Food Authority, Efsa, was under-represented by the industry experimenting with genetic plants.
This accusation is now formulated by the Expert Group on Test Biotech, which is an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," said test biotech chief Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have been under contract for years with the Ilsi lobbyists' association.
This is paid by companies like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has been a major player in the Efsa test rules for genetic plants and is thus in a clear conflict of interest, criticising Then.
The rules of the Efsa were in line with the position papers of the Ilsi and thus the handwriting of the industry, which is actually to be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma.
It was already the second time that test biotech had a conflict of interest.
For example, a high-level Efsa manager was recently without conditions or transitional period to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and thus changed the pages.
The Central German Broadcasting (MDR) has also recently revealed human resources links between the EU's controlling authority and the industrial lobby, which has made the Federal Environment Agency, as well as the European Parliament, highly sensitive.
The Efsa cannot, however, see any conflict of interest.
All serious data are taken back, including those of industry, as long as they are of high technical quality, it is said in an opinion.
The experts working for Efsa do not demand that they have no contact with industry.
But you'd have to open this up.
Kuiper is a member of the International Life Sciences Institute (Issi) in the United States.
This is itself referred to as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - including the risk assessment for biotechnology without a lobbying order.
In the matter, independent experts such as Then criticise the fact that genetically modified plants are currently being approved in animals without any feeding attempt and the reaction of genetic plants to environmental effects is not being tested.
"We want to know what, for example, is doing genetically modified maize on the field," says Then.
At present, it is only to test isolated proteins, but not the whole genetic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how do you find them?" asks Then, prosecuting.
That's what Angelika Hilbeck sees.
The scientist has been research in genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
Industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in this area, as in the US.
There are therefore hardly any researchers who are not intertwined with companies.
Critical studies for companies would generally not be published.
"Industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The Trace of the Stones
Uli Gsell has also been worried about some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday night he stood in front of Stuttgart train station, the Tuba on his back.
It was demo.
It's snowing.
The story is well known: in September the excavators had been touched and had started to break off a large piece of the northern wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: thousands of people demonstrated against S21, the million-dollar laying of the station.
When it came to the construction stop, a large part of the wing was in ruins.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Cailsheim Mushelkalk, a soft coarse stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in East Fildern, 43 years old.
He's got some of the pieces covered.
"These stones are relics."
"You can't go away."
He warms: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earth-like."
When he saw one, he smelled like a cigarette.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with the pieces yet.
There's time for stones.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest near Tübingen to a former munitions depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen has built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old deals with old stones.
He bought all those who attacked at the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame to ground them to gravel or to disappear into the landfill," he says in his office, a wooden paper that once was a guard's house.
When in September the newspapers said that he bought the remains of the North Wing from the demolition company, he was attacked and threatened.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he has explained to them that he can't do anything for the demolition.
And if it were to happen, it would be the most reasonable thing if the stones were to be used.
About 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the 80-kilo-heavy quader on average, unit price 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, but also some in the hope of giving it back in a reconstruction.
500 tons of Rongen had bought, 25 large truck charges.
About half of them are still in the woods, the rest is long sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, house builders.
They had come from everywhere and dragged away what could carry trunk and trailer.
The Stuttgart stones of the attack have long been transformed into "Mäuerle" or into limits of herb beds.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"Wouldn't be the political component."
He goes up into his ground car, takes a tour through his 20-hectare empire.
He studied law and then broke down, later biology, then he was interested in computers and finally became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
It's about 40,000 tons of stones.
From all over Germany, he carves his treasures together.
He says he's the largest old stone dealer in the Republic.
He's braking.
There are artificial sandstones in the snow.
"They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke," he tells.
Elbsandstone, yellow, warm, he's swamming.
"My favorite stone."
It goes up the road through the forest.
He points to a bunch: red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe station.
And on.
"Beautiful Travertin."
Once the quader was part of the gallery of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, cannstatter travertin from the Stuttgart police president, red granite from the Cathedral of St. Blasia, tuff from the Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen is thinking about how the stones were used to be cut by hand and moved with simple flare and oxen carts, he becomes very honourable.
"It would be a scandal if you were to yell at such a thing."
He didn't get rich, he didn't get rich at all.
But 14 people are employed by the stone dealer today, as well as in the forest of stone meth, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a gardener.
"We work hard, but it's satisfactory," says the Redeemer.
He has to go to Cologne soon.
There are also stones to save.
High-potential talent struggle
There's a lot of urge on the buffet.
16 students are pushing for salmon rolls, tomato soup and sweet.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car builder Volkswagen have invited the engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, together with VW developers, they are supposed to be very simple about the car of the future - and get to know Volkswagen by the way.
In the competition for the smartest heads, many companies are now in the close-up fight and, like VW, are putting on cooperation with the universities.
Your mission: to recruit the most gifted graduates in the hearing rooms as early as possible before they come to the labour market and are rerecruited by others.
And because the universities do not provide any information on the performance of their students, they try to track down the exceptional talents in practical projects and to bind them to themselves.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car company is promoting the talents.
A young lady from the personnel department distributes pen, rubber bears and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents of internship programmes and student jobs and shows them ways into the group.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig is responsible for the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "The students come into contact with industry and gain experience."
"VW can get to know students at the same time, look at interesting candidates and think about who would be eligible as an employee."
Such cooperation, according to Selle, is not unusual.
It is new that so openly the students are bowed around.
"Otherwise, the focus was on the technical project," says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates will probably get even harder.
In many sectors, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large range of applicants.
They must also be encouraged and, in particular, they must be able to provide high-skilled workers.
In particular, graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering stations remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will be even bigger according to VDI forecasts.
For the audit and consulting company KPMG, Roman Dykta is on the talent hunt.
It organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern carving hunt where participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the United States next year.
By the way, the participants can look at KPMG branches and get to know the company.
If you are allowed to join, you will decide in two pre-selection rounds.
Only the crème de la crème of the many candidates flies to the USA.
In the skin and stabbing around the high potential at the universities, the guns are getting bigger and bigger, according to Dykta.
"We want to take the race out of the mass."
"Only a simple sail was too little for us."
For talent hunters Dykta, the bill seems to go up.
"We have been in contact with all the participants of a similar action in the last year."
"Some are close to graduation and want to apply to us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct buoy on the campus, small and medium-sized companies are also classic at professional fairs on the Pirsch.
"We are trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"About on the Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, head of personnel at the solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonner company employs around 1500 employees in Germany.
Stäbbe knows about the problem of young people.
There are currently 35 posts on the company's website.
"It is very difficult to occupy holiday positions right now."
"It takes a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors provide evidence that you can do internships or write your thesis."
The solar specialist does not have any serious advertising activities.
For this, the company tries to promote itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and light communication.
"A large group can often not offer this," says staff manager Steube.
Money doesn't play the main role in the job search anymore.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good access opportunities are also crucial factors.
In a study by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld made 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute shall draw up an annual list of German employers.
To this end, it asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their job field and looks at the conditions for the employees.
Staff manager Steube hopes that the placement will also lead to the job-seekers.
"I think that candidates are looking especially for external assessments about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers for more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, especially internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your own employees," he says.
In the sector jargon, this is called internal employer branding, that is to say, employers' brand training within their own workforce.
"Satisfied staff are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and identify them with the company, they would be doing their own job with friends and acquaintances for their employer.
"It's like a gang game," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming years.
A ban has been adopted by the government in Washington, which is the final withdrawal of its previous plans.
In the Atlantic coast, new drills are also banned for the time being.
This was announced by Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar, on Wednesday.
The result of the strict ban, which is to apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the "Deepwater Horizon" drilling platform in April.
Before the accident that cost 11 workers life and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had signalled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico at the pressure of the opposition and industry.
The supporters want to reduce the US's dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
Those who are responsible for the devastating oil plague in the Gulf have not yet been finally clarified.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy group BP, which is faced with billions of demands.
A Commission of Inquiry on behalf of Obama is to present its results in the course of December.
In October, Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar, had lifted the drilling stop imposed after the explosion.
After that, several oil companies had also submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With more stringent controls and more stringent security rules, Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new disaster.
At the moment, the competent control authority, which had been in disrepute following numerous allegations of corruption, is being fundamentally reformed.
In parallel, Obama has announced that it will close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil and gas companies.
The industry is now publicly warning that the amount of aid in the Gulf would be significantly lower by more stringent regulation than before.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a current industry survey by the BDO consultant - even before the drilling ban of Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows what will change with the regulation."
Investment in new support projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
OgonIsland is burned down
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of litres of crude oil have destroyed nature in the Nigerian OgonIsland.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't get lost," the ecoactivist calms the journalists: "You will get enough oil sludge before the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has been following an attempt to light a boy who is waving to the chest in the water with the sling around him: in the rainbow-colored water-glances the scene looks almost beautiful.
It is not possible to see that brown crude oil swings float under the surface.
She used to collect shrimp here, telling Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
In the meantime, the slow flowing waters were completely dead.
Five years ago, huge amounts of crude oil were poured from a born pipeline into the huge wetlands.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to get to fishing waters: the OgonIsland, located in the heart of the Nigerian delta, is considered one of the most vulnerable regions in the world.
On the journey through the mangrove swamps through the river runs, the whole extent of the heating becomes apparent.
Instead of light water, the motor boat is stirring up brown broth, who dips his hand into the water, pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees are like black lacritzstängen from the ground, sad let the palm trees to be found hang their carrot.
As usual in wetlands, bird swarms are sought in vain: as soon as the outer border is silent, in the former paradise smells like a gas station, there is a spicy rest.
"What is happening here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari dark: "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The Ogoni settlement area has been a battle field for decades: the first explorers from Europe arrived here more than 60 years ago, here in the 1980s, with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, the first resistance, the Shell Group had to stop production in 1993, because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Today, the company is still denied the return to OgonIsland: while from the entire Deltaregion of the three-fold size of Switzerland with more than 5000 drilling sources and 7000 kilometres of pipelines, more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily, the oil fields in the OgonIsland are broken, the company's position is unstable.
All a few hundred meters of steel structures like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christmas trees" are called the heads of the holes far too tenderly.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the mark.
Again and again such a drilling head break apart, Akpobari says, then run a constant stream of crude oil into the water.
More than two billion litres have been released into the delta's ecosystem in 50 years, according to expert estimates: year after year, the amount of oil that it was forced into the sea in the case of the "Exxon Valdez" of the supertank, 21 years ago, before Alaska - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of humanity.
Those who are responsible for the continuing eco-GAU are being fought about it.
While the Shell Group makes sabotage and the organized oil theft responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmental protection workers see bursting drilling heads and leak pipelines as the main source.
Shell set much lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, and the US scientist Richard Steiner presented to the group in 2008: the rate of defects on the lines alone was "much higher than elsewhere."
In a place that looks from a distance like an abandoned, oil-fused workshop under the open sky, it appears from the mangrove structures: they are fragrant naked and oiled to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected with pipes, partly arbitrarily scattered on the site, a fire flicks: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First gas penetrates through the pipes into the caption head, later drips out at the end of the kerosene line and finally diesel.
So Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel of 300 litres daily: "This brings us 34.000 Naira" - about 22 dollars.
The delta inhabitants use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state of Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal chefs can still undercut the low diesel price with just under 40 euro cents per litre: they get their raw materials for free.
It comes from "bunkers," which tap the pipeline network across OgonIsland. According to experts, the country is lost at least 16 million litres of crude oil every day throughout the Nigdelta.
However, only a small part of the provisional intermediate raw material is being illegally refined: the lion's share of organised criminal networks, including politicians and high-level military, are to be filled in tank ships and are to be strengthened on the world market.
The debate, whether the environmental disaster is more due to the displacement of the population or the lax way of production, considers the activist Akpobari to be purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as invaders and would not have destroyed the fishermen 'livelihoods so thoroughly, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries."
In the meantime, the relationship of the Ogoni to Shell, in particular, was so destroyed that only a deduction of the group would be possible: "Maybe other nationalities like the Chinese are better."
That's where Michael gets nervous.
"Most of the time you're leaving," says the muscular oil man.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil-processing companies are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they will not be arrested, but will be a painful bribe.
The soldiers, who are mainly from the North of the country, want to benefit from the raw material, as all Nigerian people do.
"This damn stuff has put our country on the dog in every way," says Akpobari.
Investigators discover dangerous construction trucks in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
In the investigation of an emergency-landing machine, investigators have discovered a possible building owner that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure."
The Qantas airline is now trying to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the emergency-landed Qantas-Airbus at the beginning of November were apparently much more lucky than previously known: the Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem in its investigation in the engines of some A380 machines - and is now warning of a possible construction driver.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil hose connection, it could produce fatigue cracks and leaks, it was said in an opinion published by the ATSB authority on Thursday.
This could have led to "a catastrophic engine failure."
The engines produced by Rolls-Royce were involved in 20 A380-series aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
It submitted a complaint to an Australian federal court in Sydney, which allowed it to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas chief Alan Joyce said his airline would demand compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
When the engine was on fire, parts had dissolved and the surfaces had been damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that they would carry out further safety tests on the Superjumbos equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation was the result of a cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security problem was considered to be sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily left about three of its 11 A380 on the ground.
Lufthansa switched off the engine in an A380 as a precaution.
The double-story plane is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
National snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany in white: almost all the country has fallen snow over the night.
There are chaos, trains and flights on many roads.
In car accidents, at least three people were killed.
The winter is freezing in Germany: At icy temperatures, almost the whole Republic has been snowed to Thursday at night - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
On several motorways and many roads, traffic is very limited.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the winter service was in continuous use, but was not finished with the constantly new snow.
In addition, heavy soils swept over the Baltic coast.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrography Office (BSH) is waiting on the East Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning on storm floods with water levels of 1.2 meters above the normal level.
In Saxony, the snow traffic on the motorways and federal roads caused significant problems.
According to the weather centre Meteomedia, in the Saxon Switzerland, therefore, the level of the alert was the highest in the world.
In some cases, 30 centimeters of fresh snow fell, fresh and strong winds made for relocations.
There were several trucks and cars in the night.
In Saxony-Anhalt, too, the police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2 snow and wind led to strolling traffic and congestion.
In Thuringia, the snow falls affected the A4 and A9.
According to German railway, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and in the north of Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, overthrown trees on the tracks or destroyed overhead lines and paths are the main problems.
In Saxony, the distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld, an ICE had to stop its trip to Munich.
The 165 passengers were supplied by firemen and rescue workers with wool blankets, food and drinks on the train.
Snow winds swept over the streets.
At large German airports, the snowwinds lead to numerous flight failures.
A number of cancellations have already been reported in Munich, according to a speaker at the flight information centre.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a Fraport speaker, 40 flights have already been cancelled.
The winter service was in continuous use.
Although only a few stranded passengers were at the airport, they still had 400 field beds available for them.
There were accidents on many roads already on Wednesday night.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed in a collision with a train on a train crossing in Ostholstein.
The lead was slightly injured.
There was a similar accident near Nuremberg due to snow-covered roads: here too a truck was recorded on a train crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
On the train four passengers were injured - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she overlaid herself on the smooth road with her car at Aschaffenburg.
But the meteorists still have good news: Although the snow will still be relaxed and pulsy and will therefore already be stirring up in light soils.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is hit by fast and storming winds.
However, it remains very cold - in places up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for their twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the money house is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euros could bring in the property.
The Deutsche Bank has just made its headquarters beautiful: the twin storms in the Frankfurt banking district have been modernised; now the bankers have been allowed back to their old job.
But now the financial group obviously wants to get the costs of the renovation out again - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rise houses, as the "Financial Times Germany" writes on behalf of a speaker.
The speaker did not mention reasons for the planned sale.
"We always check whether it makes more sense to own or sell real estate and then rent it back," he said.
Germany's largest credit institution will be back to its headquarters after a short time.
The Bank had only taken over the double towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of a home-owned fund and then rehabilitated it.
The energy conversion was the result of some EUR 200 million.
A sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to the newspaper, industry experts estimate the value of the towers now renamed "Greentowers" to be around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor, is still open, said the speaker.
Thousands of mourn for dead buddy
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the wasted miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies were still unable to be recovered because the safety situation in the bad-luck shaft is still precarious.
The Pike River Mine, near the city of Greymouth, was a major explosion just two weeks ago.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were spilled underground.
A probe had been dropped into the bad luck shaft, but had not discovered any trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and further subsequent explosions, no rescue forces could go down for safety reasons.
After the second severe detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no longer any chance of survival for the buddies.
The bodies could not be recovered so far.
Now relatives and friends with a memorial to the dead remembered.
Ten thousand people had gathered in Greymouth on the South Island of New Zealand in the light of sunshine.
They stayed silent for two minutes.
In honor of the troubled miners, 29 tables were set up, on which helmets, lamps and the names of the buddies were to be seen.
Images and personal objects, including clothes and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the country's government buildings, the flags were on half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would come back to the surface "from the depths of the earth," said New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key to the participants of the memorial.
"But they never came home."
He could not close with the death of his son, as long as he had not seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the victims' families, several foreign diplomats participated in the memorial.
At the first explosion on November 19, miners of British and South African origin had also been spilled.
Rescue workers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
Once the explosive gases have been displaced, it will start to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, said police president Gary Knowles to journalists.
To hell, warrior!
Does Splatter fit the art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn has rediscovered old genre borders with his fighter-epic "Walhalla Rising."
What audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is free from his penitents and is killing his opponents with almost superhuman powers in a row - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, just because our hero likes to use rabid killing methods and his enemies are already tearing the guts out of his living body when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, an eye, as it is actually called, does not say a word to the whole film, and the other figures can be drawn to one or two sentences or a few painful death cries at most.
Otherwise, it is kept silent and swollen in the creepy beautiful hills of Scotland, which the Viking world of about a thousand years ago offers the backdrop.
Ideal for adult cineastes with interest in existentialism and very quiet camera gates.
Well, if a movie has several target groups, it's only a shame if they rule out each other.
Director Winding Refn has been considered a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and styled drug dealer trilogy "Pusher," but he refuses to make his works accessible to the House with a little more humor to the mainstream or a little less brutality.
Most art kino friends are likely to be afraid of the brain mass and the intestines.
The action fans will die before boredom at the latest when, for free-to-interpret reasons, an eye breaks up with a force of violent Christian missionaries by ship to Jerusalem and is stuck with an eternity in flute and fog before the team appears to arrive in America and continues to remain silent there.
No wonder, therefore, that "Walhalla Rising" in Germany has not found a cinema rental and has now only appeared on DVD.
This is particularly a shame because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to puffling facade a sometimes exciting piece of cinema is hidden, which has earned some attention.
This film is not about dialogues or a strict act, it's all the atmosphere, a film-made fever dream.
And there is no escape from it for the spectator.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation, and with his icy pictures and the dark trance-like sound track he slowly sears his throat, but above all with the inconceivable hatred that confronts him from the heart of the figures.
Only a little blond boy, who is loyal to one eye, keeps something like innocence, all others are driven by anger.
Most of the one-eyed hero whose motives are never explained, but who eventually becomes a warrior from hell for enemies and temporary allies, may be the ambassador of the devil himself.
It means destruction, but perhaps only for those who are already lost.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, to the detriment, excitement and wonder.
It's an experience.
Curious earth works
The IAEA Nuclear Energy Authority has new evidence of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
However, the country is refusing to comment on this - it still allows for controls.
Around midnight from September 5 to September 6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft attack a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It is located on the banks of the Euphrates; the next larger city, 30 km away, is Dair as-Saur.
Her name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built in the Quader with the help of North Korea, hidden in a valley that goes off the grid.
According to a briefing of the CIA's foreign intelligence service at the end of April 2008, this reactor, which was also called the near town of el-Kibar, would have been well-known to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, however, the technology from the fifties is hardly good.
The CIA performed a video presentation with unsharp satellite images.
By computer animation, it hid where the components of the reactor were supposed to have been before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
She also presented photos that show the building from nearby or even the interior.
The reactor was just before the start-up, it was said, but not yet covered with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, hardly any more is known than at that time, but the puzzles have become more important over time.
The former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was quite sure before the attack that Syria built a reactor in el-Kibar, but did not see any evidence that there was "an active nuclear weapon programme" in the country.
Some of the intelligence services in Europe prefer to be even more careful and only speak of a "supposed reactor," even if they think the CIA presentation is "plausible."
They lack hard evidence, as do the IAEA.
Asked how safe he was to have a reactor ahead of him, a high UN diplomat in the summer only answered lapidar that the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions."
The Syrians quickly removed the debris of the alleged "unused military building" and planned the site thoroughly.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium produced by humans in el-Kibar.
In addition, through a Member State, the IAEA received satellite images of commercial suppliers from the time immediately after the attack, which is likely to be more significant than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always been taxed to have never operated a secret nuclear programme or built a reactor.
The uranium came from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus.
However, after analysis of the particles, the IAEA rejected this as unlikely.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - as well as the satellite images.
It also denies the inspectors a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the destroyed building.
Israel, too, is silent.
"We will never comment on this," recently confirmed the official position of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, at the time of the attack.
The investigation of the case has been unsuccessful since June 2008 and "is becoming a serious problem of credibility for the Authority," as a high Western diplomat admits at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna - after all, there is a serious violation of the Nuclear-Weapons-Proliferation Treaty, which the IAEA is monitoring.
As a key to progress in the field of education, the IAEA appears to see three other institutions that are "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor - and unlike these still exist.
So far, the inspectors have not disclosed which installations they are dealing with, nor what function they have or what makes them seem suspicious.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are internally referred to as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these places and has identified a building complex on satellite images at Masyaf, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base - precisely on this basis, Syria is denying the IAEA access to the three locations.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA is being prosecuted by the United States to delay military facilities.
The nuclear detectors had become aware of the facilities by a tip from the US intelligence services.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the quader was transported to and from the Euphrates material.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production."
However, there is "no evidence of sensitive activities," i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb should have been separated later, there are at least plausible assumptions about these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris that could contain valuable traces were stored in three places.
As if the hundreds of truck loads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants information on where the debris has gone.
The salt mine al-Tibni, located just a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria examined in 1998 for its suitability as a camp for radioactive waste, is considered to be unlikely.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently associated them with the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
However, images from the orbit show that Syria did earth work in the three suspicious places and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This can be a coincidence, but it has hardly helped to remove the suspicion.
It is also said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA has used several months to develop a plan for inspections there that should allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only the effort shows how much the inspectors' interest is.
However, Damascus also made this proposal.
A year ago, Western diplomats in Vienna claimed that the reactor had been destroyed, so the matter has not been of high urgency, about US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been putting into play for a few months so-called special inspections, one of the most powerful means that the Vienna nuclear authority has to enforce controls.
IAEA Chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already mentioned "an option for which I am open in the future," but he is still hesitant.
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors is needed, and on the other hand, some of the 35 countries represented there are nothing but an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat says, "What if they find nothing in the end?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her still nameless government debut in the summer, there's been trouble.
The script she wrote herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
You don't know much more about it - but that's enough for trouble.
The rumor, the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, and some of the days planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary in the short term.
The film has now been turned off in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female war victims wrote about the UN refugee aid plant UNHCR to Jolie and asked for a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie is himself an ambassador of the UN refugee aid plant.
It is not diplomatic - it has offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they rejected it.
The meeting was to take place in Bosnia, said Hasecic.
There have been no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims tells her enough about the script.
According to the UN refugee agency, her organisation has recommended that Jolie be released as an ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was able to read its script, has granted a filming permit for Sarajevo after some time - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come.
The young author himself is charged, she does not pursue political intentions with her film, has worked with great effort in the Yugoslavia conflict, wanted to show the terrible consequences of the war and to give a voice to all the parties involved.
However, it remains vague with regard to content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film on the network, which then sounds quite different: the lovers knew about it before the outbreak of the war and met again when they, a Bosnian Muslim, were dragged into a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds a lot different than the version "rape victims are falling in love with torture."
That Jolie's film actually starts before the war - so much is safe.
The pressure on them, Jolie said, is "unfair and based on false information."
Now, the only way to get her peace is to get the hackers of Hollywood: by putting the script, like so many before, on the net illegally.
Let's get out of here.
This evening, it's finally going right around for the Irish.
No sign of fraud.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans were joyed with joy with loud music, they were stamping with their feet.
The Bailey pub in the South Irish Cork quakes because the players throw table tennis balls over a three-metre distance in beer cup - and meet.
"Bierpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, to win there is 500 Euro victory premium plus flight tickets to Las Vegas for the Bierpong World Cup in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this silent drinking game and the restraining computer scientist, that doesn't really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old is trying to amuse himself to get distracted from the boring question of what the future will bring.
His plan does not include playing fun in Las Vegas, he will be in New Zealand in January.
"I have a huge feeling," he says.
"It's so far away from home and I still don't have a job there."
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had a ruck, she had her wish job as an event manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of bad prospects at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have already sought their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the Tanners it looks on the island in many families.
It is estimated that 100,000 Irish people will leave the country in the near future, as experts from the ESRI Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin predict.
By 2015, they even expect 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, a serious loss.
If the forecasts are true, there is a wave of emigration comparable to that of Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of recovery, which brought great prosperity to the Irish, Tristasse is now spreading again.
The economic crisis is particularly disturbing for the young, well-trained Irish, who have so far only been on the rise.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the years of the boom.
Everyone was needed, money was in abundance.
But now three out of ten women and men under thirty are out of work.
In the Irish Times there are too many letters of reading of young immigrants who complain: "Everything is going down in Ireland."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can, goes away and our country loses a whole generation."
"The last one will turn out the light, please."
Jura student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees a dark future coming up, because the government is only doing eye-to-eye work and is no longer offering young people any prospects for the future.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they do not have a strategy on how to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She's watching her commilitons hang out from an unpaid internship to the next.
Her greatest concern, she says, is to have to emigrate in four years' time.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
In doing so, men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to make a positive contribution to the subject.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo," a trade fair that offers a roundabout service on work abroad.
"For job-seekers, work abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career leader," says the manager.
On his website show photos surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a galley service, but also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something else, Seán O'Donovan has known for half a year.
Because there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they're pulling up a fashion house.
In January we continue to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
In the meantime, O'Donovan has only rarely seen his home, because he makes extra layers to pay off the loan for his home.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he says, when he first stepped over the threshold of his house after a long time.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am as good as never again."
He laughs a little shy and goes through cooled rooms.
The small house is located in a fine residential area with well-maintained orchards, in the entrances parking large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for 380,000 euros four years ago - 100 percent of the loan.
"There were crazy times, there were simple money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid that the credit could go wrong?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pour hot tea and say, "I don't have children I have to feed through, and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start from new."
The building engineer does not like the weaving that he is hearing at the moment.
"No one has to starve - our situation is by far not as dramatic as it was in earlier times here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe that makes us feel like Irish."
He laughs and then tells about his father who went to England in the last big economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes that thought.
Let the future open and just see how things are going with life elsewhere.
A few years of work in London, he's already behind him, and why should New Zealand not be doing well for him and his girlfriend?
But there is one thing that is still worrying him in these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He's afraid it could end up in a good-bye party.
"Not just too many emotions," he says and drinks a big sip of his beer.
"Good-bye, that sounds scary."
"Let's call it a walk-away party, easy, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democatric Routine
The democratic movement in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
The Latinobarómetro survey, carried out in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist, was carried out on these results.
This survey has been carried out regularly since 1995, showing the change of views in this region.
Two facts are particularly relevant in this year's September and October survey.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and second, the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased significantly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has been growing by about 6% a year since 2002, the number of democratic supporters increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
This trend can also be seen in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since its strong collapse last year.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which reduces the regional average (see Chart 2).
About 44% of respondents said that they were satisfied with their country's democratic practice, which is as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Graph 3).
About 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, Latin American economic crises undercut the efforts to increase democracy.
This continued during the world economic crisis may be due to the fact that the countries of Latin America have only experienced a short recession phase and have recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were caught by a stronger social network.
(According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America increased only slightly in 2009 and fell by 32% again this year.)
However, there are strong mood differences from country to country (see diagram 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread idea of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case.
For the second time since the beginning of the survey, many people in Latin America see a greater problem in crime in their country than in unemployment (see Figure 5).
About 31% say that either they themselves or a family member have been the victims of a crime in the last year, but compared with 38% in the last year, the values have fallen and thus reached the lowest level since 1995.
The increase in economic performance is reflected in the increased support for the private and market sectors: around 71% of respondents have reported that the private sector is essential for development, while in 2007 it was 56% (see Chart 6).
About 58% said that only the market economy can make progress in their country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private economy), although their left-wing President, Hugo Chávez, is a member of many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year), Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
The respondents in Mexico and most of the countries of Central America, on the other hand, see the most influential country in the US, with this role being taken over in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela.
A slumber
No one expected the elections to be perfect in Haiti on 28 November.
But the facts far exceeded the fears of the electors who hastened to help the occupied country.
Overcrowded ballot boxes, multiple votes, ballot cards in the stone, destroyed election offices and intimidation were only part of the problems.
Wahllokale opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitian people, many of whom had become homeless by the earthquake in January, fought around to find a choice.
Some of them finally gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected leaders, demanded the lifting of the election results due to a alleged fraud.
There were partly violent protests throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election "as quite good in many matters."
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "these irregularities, however serious they may be, do not necessarily make the process invalid."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which is allegedly committed to the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected selection is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martelli and the former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity action.
If Jude Célestin, who finds little or no agreement with the voters, is declared the winner of the election by the election hearing, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in tents, a low level of participation was feared.
On the day of the election, many Haitian people were prevented from voting by a lack of organization.
Shortly before the start of the election, about 250,000 ID cards that were needed for the election were not yet distributed.
There's a lot at stake.
The donor countries regard a legitimate, recognised government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitian themselves have the same opinion.
secretly in the middle
In the weeks after your husband's sudden death, Argentina's President, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that increased its popularity rate by 20 points to over 50%, which is the highest value since their election in 2007.
But whether this will help her to re-election next year depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fernández is more compromisable than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs of this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also led economic policy after his wife's election, often set out budgets that did not fully take into account tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the President's couple to spend the extra revenue on their own account.
On paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further disappointments.
Some of the regime critics from the ranks of the ruling perists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (where one parliamentarian hit another in the face and others accused the government of bribery) Congress failed to adopt the 2011 budget.
"I will not discuss it," said the President.
The 2010 budget now also applies for the next year, which gives the President even more opportunity to spend money on his own account.
The economy is hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the trade unions - are at the rate of almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction as its main objectives, not the reduction in inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, enraged the private sector and cleaned the National Institute of Statistics and Census INDEC, which then beautiful the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández take a more moderate path now?
It has called on the private sector and the trade union leaders to talk.
And according to official statements, wage increases are to be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
However, inflation undercut the growth rate by a large devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fernández may want to reconnect Argentina to the rest of the world financially.
At the beginning of this year, the government reached an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country's previous debt redebt in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to be pressing for an agreement with the parisian club's donors, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchner had always rejected a review by the IMF, as was the case in other countries.
But last month, Minister of Economy Amado Boudou announced that the Fund will provide "technical support" in the preparation of a new national consumer price index, and it looks like this is the first step towards the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active even without her husband's support after her term of office has ended.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which has largely enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentinean people return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy that was brought to them will have been quenched.
If she wants to win another choice, she has to decide whether she is holding up many political decisions of her husband quietly and quietly.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother beyond the sea?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of all those entitled to vote, were elected to the five districts of mayors and councillors, which is considered to be a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
By building groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma itself is a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese mother country for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the test, but only a little.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, she did not receive a majority vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which supports the greater independence of Taiwan, received almost 50% of the votes, and KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's voting rate has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election, there were the usual events in Taiwan, such as truck convoys with Krawallmakers, flags-swinging mass retreats and only sparsely dressed dancers.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious murder attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and the honorary chairman of the KMT gave a speech on the eve of the election to a KMT candidate,
When a man from the crowd shot him in the face. Lien was wounded and a surrounding audience killed.
Bizarrerweiser is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless of this, the attack, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, has affected the choice and put the DPP in a bad light, which has given the KMT more votes.
China may have been the biggest winner of the campaign.
It is worth noting that relations with the mainland have not been discussed.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their actual independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to highlight its relations with the Beijing government.
This time, however, the DPP also fails to promote the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
She thus responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
On the one hand, the majority of Taiwanese people are in favour of their China policy.
The Beijing Government will continue to pursue its strategy of bringing Taiwan back to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly also wants political integration, but the most important thing first.
It would rather wait until after the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
Two years ago, she was very weak: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he vehemently supported absolute independence.
But under Tais Regentschaft a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP is fighting for the voices of the workers and the youth.
As a presidential candidate of the DPP, Tsai found great support, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything to show that she too is able to establish close relations with Beijing.
Tsai is planning an idea forge as a contact point between the DPP and China. However, this requires prejudiced discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offered a "trusted alternative" to Mas's advance approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he said that the candidates of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He even called on the pragmatist Su to renounce the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen's intervention, the DPP is hard to choose its potential candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run their campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing gap between the poor and the rich.
According to a KMT speaker, he will redesign his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong occurrence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is only limited in favour of re-approaching.
At the same time, most Taiwanese people see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is already no return."
Grammy nominations: The jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the category Newcomer of the year
If you stand up at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony. Now the 26-year-old jazz bass player and singer were surprisingly nominated for this year's Grammy in the category Newcomer of the year.
In view of the fact that Spalding has been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since her album "Esperanza" in 2008, the nomination appears to be a little unusual. However, it is in line with the Grammy rules that an artist may have released a maximum of three albums before the album was released to the general public.
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society," is certainly a step forward. And with her hard-pressed voice and a good sense for pop, radio and Latin music, you can easily compare Spalding with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 is closest as a jazz interpreter in this category of nomination Spaldings.
The album "History" of the Vijay Iyer Trios was also nominated in the category of instrument albums. This favorite of the critics experienced a huge success.
The competitors of Iyers include "Moody 4B" by the experienced saxophone James Moody and "Positoously" by the keyboarder John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a rugged favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in HBOs "Treme," was awarded in the category of contemporary jazz, in which otherwise more albums can be found by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Societ of the wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue was well-deserved in the category of large group. He is therefore against the Billy Children Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life-ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra is listed with five votes, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse," an eclectic orchestra work, with three votes.
Among the nominees with connections to South California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles." This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered in the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his mandolin concert.
Classic nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classical producers five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's symphonies No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concert Building Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" presented by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chor.
In the opera category, Bergs "Lulu of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses" Marc Antonio e Cleopatra "by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos" L'Amour de Loin "by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's" The Enchanted Wanderer "by the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan's" Ivanhoe "by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, Pärt for Symphony No 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" were nominated for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No 4 was premiered and recorded on 4 January in Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonic under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute piece has the title "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkowski, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolinen Concerto" received a nomination in the category instrumental solo with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. said he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the Mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I have used sounds from the Middle East and many North African sounds and rhythms," said Dorman in a phone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category of orchestra performance for a recording of the works of Stravinsky with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
The pianist Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harfinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated as instrumental soloists.
This year, only women were nominated as vocal soloists, including Anne Sofie of Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
The soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
Mosque in Temecula wins the approval of the Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula, after a five-hour, often hot public hearing, found the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic congestion.
But according to a statement from the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre is in line with local provisions and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, Chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As an American, that makes me proud."
"It shows that justice exists."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"You're just very loud."
"There are wonderful people living in this valley."
The meeting began at 18: 00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the centre lasted almost until midnight, with the votes on both sides were fairly evenly distributed, according to the press-Enterprise.
The debate was continued on the website of the newspaper.
"There is no more America," said a comment.
"It's another planet of the monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand."
"America is at the end."
Planned Islamic centres have also led to protests in other parts of the country, for example near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the City of New York on 11 September 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmush has called for non-violence.
His community with about 135 families has been living peacefully in Riverside County for years. But they wanted a larger and better place than the camp they rented together with a manufacturer of water filter systems.
The new Mediterranean-style mosque, about 2,300 m2, is to have two minarets and become about 13m high.
It is to be found on the plot of about 17.500 m2 on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Adversaries can still object to the project at the City Council.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could allow new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign bacterial species, which can live, among other things, from arsenic, opens up new opportunities for new forms of life on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, it is in their view a sign that life is possible even without the elements considered necessary to life.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"It needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
"This makes it something very special, although it is almost a kind of 'foreign' life form," said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online edition of the Science magazine.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But as the scientists found out, the bacterium in the California Mono Lake is growing even further when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
"It is a question of what else is possible," said the co-author of the Ariel D. Anbar report from Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for alien life, as scientists must recognize life and its forms, says Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were announced, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could act on the discovery of alien life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems organisms can start biochemical processes with the help of other elements and that the 'standard elements', which we believe are absolutely vital, are not necessarily defined," said Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novel, because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," added Cockell.
This discovery was not by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, chose Mono Lake due to the high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, it assumed that microbes exposed to both may replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of the arsenic is mainly due to the chemical nature of it as phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for the organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic acts differently than phosphorus. It comes into our biochemical system, where it almost lubricates everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing concentration of arsenic. It adapted and grew.
The microbe grows better in phosphorus, but that it can also survive in arsenic shows that an arsenic-based life form can naturally occur, either on Earth or on another planet or moon, on which arsenic is more common.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a microbiology lecturer at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new, but there has been no working example yet.
Arsen was more common in the early years of the earth, she says, so science has assumed that early life forms have used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life may have developed differently than in the early age of the earth," says Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs that were stolen from a Bellflower motel were found on Thursday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, as unknown to the 2006 Chevrolet Express-Van steel, where the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, according to government statements.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday night, explains Steve Whitmore, a spokesperson of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is, the dogs are well run," says Whitmore.
"They're in good condition."
"They were returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore did not provide precise information on the location of the dogs or the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigation is still under way."
"We don't want to say any more," explains Whitmore.
"We're following a few tracks."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon at a local animal home in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were, according to the government's statement, unharmed.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to introduce Rickard and Peek to the competition this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city this weekend because of the AKC / Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, because Trace was supposed to take part in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days before the AKC / Eukanuba show.
South California is a stop on the almost one month tour of the couple from dog show to dog show.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They often stay in Motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer puppy, a parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - into their motel room.
The thick Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open, so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen on Tuesday at 6: 00.
Peek promised anyone who could give a hint of the Corgis a finder's wage. The animals were implanted with microchips for identification.
On Thursday it was not yet clear whether a finder's wage was paid.
The lion roars again after the court's approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got green light for a new start.
A New York competitor blessed the "prepare" plan on Thursday to eliminate the debt of $5 billion and to pave the way for new movies and TV shows to the 86-year-old entertainment company.
According to the statements of Thursday, the plan meets the requirements of US bankruptcy law, so that the relaunch of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, is no longer in the way. Barber and Birnbaum will be the leading director of the studio.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 will not enter into force until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned loan of $500 million to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which is itself bringing in $75 million, is running the company.
The restructuring of the studio started in May 2009 with the order to help the investment bank Moelis & Co, the management of the company, which was fighting interest payments of $300 million / year, solve its financial problems.
In August, the CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert, who was known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The efforts of Moelis & Cooper to solve the financial concerns of MGMs and to pay for the studio's more than 140 runners lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company for purchase.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion required by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything started from the beginning when the MGM team started the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors at the end of October after months of debate and internal disputes.
If MGM has officially survived the bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, is $9.5 million
Cooper, who was paid for the management of the company monthly $375,000, will receive a "success bonus" of $4 million
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio only released one film and created an annual plan with seven or eight films to come into the cinemas at the beginning of 2012.
They also plan two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share in these two films, which are to be created under the direction of Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who has financed about 18% of the MGM loan, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
But the last negotiations between the two companies did not result in any result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both players can tear a significant hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game is about 10 classic jump lines or about 48 doses of play-doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently I visited three electronic toys under $80 three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had come into force. This year, the technology toys are more powerful and cost a little less than last year.
And although less new toys appear with their own website, there is a wider offer on the most well-known of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin.
More and more button-operated toys are coming on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise specified, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years of age) are plush figures, as big as guinea pigs that sing a note when you press on their belly.
Press once corresponds to a note, by pressing several times you can play a song.
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you have started pressing, you can't stop.
For a combination of singing and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the development of Elmo Live technology last year, the animatronic doll offers interplay as' Simon says', and thanks to the innovative hinge with wheel blocking it dominates the moon walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. However, their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the '80s, you must remember Alphie, one of the first computer-based learning toys.
Now he's back (Hasbro / Playskol, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of questions cards that can make a car ride a lesson, with a better guy with a car correction function as a teacher.
If you do not want to trust your child with your smartphone, there are three independent alternatives here.
MobiGo from VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included on it are not as instructive as those on the Leaster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped with a new, brighter screen after Leapfrog's first major revision of the Leaster series.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL of Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for the games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be considered.
Finally, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are not larger than a match box and have their own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together in words before the time runs out. It is great for an improvised spelling competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go to the toy shops alone after the offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
For example, to give your child an online animal at the Club Penguin, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2 "Mix'N Match Figure Package ($5 for children from 6 to 12), which contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits at Club Penguin Store for two more parts.
That could be roller shoes or a buffalo animal.
The latest head cell-operated microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him out of dummies through a maze garden.
And he can do a lot of things.
We fell from the kitchen table and even survived some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China are getting softer
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped over an urban square, checked his nervous subordinates and gave orders with military authority and a dampened voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust guards of the urban order, to be feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their tendency to violence - to impress the audience.
"Stand right there!"
"Look straight ahead!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how beautiful girls are!"
Four girls, barely ungrown from the age of a teenager, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and pants stood in the air.
Four pairs of black pumps were in straight line.
Four proper hats were sitting perfectly on the hair held with blue and white striped loops.
"They look on average to me," Mr Tang notes with little shame.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish up the image of China's city inspectors.
In one city, all new candidates must have a degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey green one.
Wuhan replaced violence in Central China with low-level starvation: in 2009, reports reported that 50 officials were circling a non-properly set-up snack car and staring at the operator until it packed in after half an hour and left the place.
Xindu, a district in Chengdu with a population of 680,000, wants to change the image fundamentally.
Since 2003, 13 women have been strengthening the urban police forces. They have been selected because of their appearance, good character and youth.
They're supposed to give the coarse police a softer, feminine aspect.
But, unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would not be able to improve the bad picture that the Chinese have of these city commandos.
The critics are right.
Unlike the police, these officials are only allowed to enforce urban laws by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in the province of Hubei examined a spectator to death when he filmed her with his cell phone, as they put down a protest against a dump.
Last year, a training manual of the Peking officials was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai water melon dealer suffered brain injuries after a handful of five officials.
A video game of violence that can be downloaded from the Internet shows trained officials in China in an attack on road dealers.
"Chengguan scares the government," the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year, after further controversy about tactics.
The newspaper called for a "really thorough cleaning."
Skeptics consider the current approach to be clearly insufficient.
When the district was looking for eight female recruits in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether the women had real tasks or should only serve as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to the job display, women aged 18 to 22 were sought with good figure and "harmonious facial traits."
They should be above average large - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1 / 2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with the age of 26.
According to the officials, the work for women over 25 is too hard.
"The most important is her image," an unnamed district official reported on the quasi-government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their external appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come temperament and "inner qualities."
"Female Chengguan are like flower vases," he said and added, "but beyond that they have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Head of the District City Administration, does not wish to agree to this description,
However, it admitted that in China, size requirements in job ads for both sexes are not unusual.
The same applies to uniform facial features.
Whether this is equivalent to good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disappointments do not need to apply.
"We cannot, unfortunately, use any lamen or buckets here," said Mr Zheng.
"Your image would not be good."
Liu Yi, who is patrolling on the Baoguang square near a monastery, is 22, has apple bays and a well-formed mouth.
She did not feel as sexistic that so great a value is placed on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic look.
Your colleague with the dimples, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, comments, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to their information, they do not regret the short attitude, as they have more ambitious career plans than just to scare traders through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the strip deals with about 12 street traders who try to sell as many rolls and tofu dishes as possible on foot or on the bike before they are chased away.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We have told you so many times!" explains Frl. Xu to a dealer who had fled on foot and had temporarily abandoned his noodles on a bike car.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than exhausting.
"It's the same thing almost every day," explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies distribution in leisure.
"All routine."
One reason is that the female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of the traders, like their male colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals to report them to their male superiors.
This is to protect them from public attacks that are often exposed to civil servants in China.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, ran after the rumor that Chengguan officials had killed a dealer.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured at night, 14 government vehicles were thrown over or set on fire.
Xindu has been spared from such acts of violence so far.
But there is no need to rule out unrest.
Only two blocks from the quiet Baonguang square, where the female officials patrolling this morning, more than 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired against the rules on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop.
The owner screamed Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officials were on their way to their vehicles with a grim face and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a co-ordinator of the male strife, remained behind, turning his white name sign around to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbal."
"But sometimes also physically," explains Mr Li sober.
"Most of the time people start the fight."
Prosecutor will not sue Senator Ensign
Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the charges that were brought against him after his affair with a former elector and his attempt to give her husband a lobbying activity, the senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious lawsuit against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal that caused headlines across the country and put a damper on his career, he was considered a possible presidential candidate of the Republicans for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "very pleased" with the judgment after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate's ethics committee could still impose a disciplar sentence.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign have been terminated and that there are no further charges in this matter.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The judgment was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. In her opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign disrespected the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that were first published in the New York Times in October 2009 gave rise to the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electors, helped to create lucrative orders to buy his silence about an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was a treasurer during an election campaign in Ensigns.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton to work. According to the documents and interviews he took over for her after the recruitment of Hampton's lobbying work.
As Hampton was recently on Ensign's election team, he was not allowed to do any lobbying work for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, was against the so-called ban on the "turning door lobbying."
According to the published evidence, "everything seems to be a deal and the violation of the revolving door statutes," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the defense of clients in the government's direction.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to announce the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethical authorities said that the Ministry seemed very careful in taking political charges after a large number of defeats followed by the media with great interest, including the decision last year to drop the charges against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct by the prosecutor.
Prosecutors "are obviously terrible," said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the Association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington," a group of lawyers who brought various charges against Mr. Ensign.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, the main defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he received a call from a public prosecutor on Monday and another one the next day he was told that the Ministry would not raise any complaints against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defense had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to explain more precisely the legal arguments he had put forward to the prosecutors.
"I am not comfortable with going into the details of the discussion between the Ministry of Justice and me. Only so much is said: we believe we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to stop the investigation for a separate action by the Ethics Group, after which a payment of $96,000 from Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons had violated the Federal Electoral Act.
The Electoral Commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that has long supported the senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found lobbyist work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign.
An e-mail from December 2008 shows that after Mr. Hampton's company continued as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, had an interview with Mr. Hampton in which he told him that he was "knocking on" at the Ministry of the Interior for one thing.
Mr. Ensign was also meeting Mr. Hampton and another client from Nevada, Allegiant Air, for lunch and asked the transport minister to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Mr. Hampton for lobbying.
Last year, when information about this affair first came to the public, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had been fourth in the rank of the Republicans.
After many months of unnoticed, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was planning a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of police research, his press speaker, Jennifer Cooper, the senator, said that the ethics commission is very quickly following the example of the Ministry of Justice and his investigation.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people of Nevada," she said.
Cheshire call draws attention to Twitter
Half a dozen of them tipped off in the riverbed in the courtroom.
In a minute, they sent their reports on cruel testimony via Twitter.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter reports about the rape process and children chained to beds in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, the carefully followed trial by Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the judge's verdict on the death sentence that the jury has issued falls.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already submitted requests to court to explain the reasons for an appeal and to employ the courts for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intensive reporting of the process - also through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - has brought about a "circus atmosphere" and so widespread, in-depth penetrating details, so that the jury has been inadvertently influenced by public indignation.
This opposition could lead the appeal courts to consider whether the new technologies would make new rules in the courtroom necessary.
"As I have experienced during this process, I believe that it is really a danger that the entry of the new technologies into the courtroom will affect every individual's right to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes' main defender.
The President, Jon C. Blue, of the Supreme Court, rejected the requests by decision in a short and concise way last week when he said that the new media would be "carefully controlled," and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word on this matter.
For decades, legal objections have found that the reporting of famous-notorious cases raises doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In its 1966 historic decision, the United States Supreme Court of Justice lifted the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland, who was supposed to have killed his wife, and said in his decision that there was a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the new media.
Some believe that the TV series and the game film "On the Escape" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that legal objections that Mr Haye's conviction is about half a century later could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communication routes from the courtroom that were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the new media in processes that are being pursued by a wide public," said John J. Donohue III, Professor at Stanford Law School, who has examined the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it is arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some of the appeal courts could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of an in-depth communication from the courtroom could make the processes fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many who explain Mr. Hayes' lawyers to discuss for years and thus delay a conviction.
The defenders also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have been convicted when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential judges by showing them cruel crime scene photos during the selection of judges.
Some of the jurors have said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and their daughters, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, would have filled them with abhorrence.
The defenders say that they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judge had wrongly exchanged a jury that was a critic of the prosecutor's office, and that he would have put undue pressure on the judgment when he had made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The judges were not isolated.
But their arguments about the impact of the detailed reporting on the process may be of great interest.
In a judgment they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the Governor's office and for the American Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continuously rekindled the flames of emotions about the case.
"Such a daily demand of media beepers, cameras and reporters outside the court office," the lawyers wrote, "has not been experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even across the country."
Their focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more elaborate than reports that are being reported more slowly is a technical enemy view that is undermining the reporting of future processes.
But some lawyers said that appeal courts were often confronted with the argument that social and technical changes needed adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers are strengthening this claim.
In their opposition, they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which Dr. Sheppard's conviction was lifted as a result of the reporting and made it clear that the New Media requires new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the separation?
After a campaign of words of shame and negativity, this week little courtesy has broken out in Washington.
Is it the omen of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before you return to the fight of the parties in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and the top of the Congress did not break through on the big issues that had to be dealt with during the so-called "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a government period in which no decisions were taken.
After all you hear, it was neither a polite discussion between two different sides nor a respect for their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partisan point collection.
The public meeting of the President's deficit commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months gives rise to mutual respect, covering up the ideological gap that continues to separate members.
This is hardly enough to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other sign of willingness to cooperate and compromise demands, while one is trying to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a new party war.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it is about taxes, donations, health or expectations, the two sides are miles away from each other.
Finally, at least for a short time, the Washington November election has voted mildly.
"No question, the sound has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government, who is now working for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections raise partisan passions that die again.
And that's good. "
In some issues, especially those on the agenda of the "lame duck session," Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution. "
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one supports that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or all of them, whether temporary or permanent.
A compromise is also to be expected with regard to the increased unemployment money, even if only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe that the preferred tax cuts for the rich, while they refuse to support unemployed workers.
After the meeting in the White House on Tuesday, optimism has increased that one can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" while also ratifying the New START Treaty.
But William Glaston des Brookings Insituations warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of the lame duck session "does not necessarily lead to a lasting cooperation of the parties when the new 112. Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-agreement is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - which leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what happens from today until 2012, as a forefight, or shadow boxes, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who were useful for their formation.
As the Republican leaders may be concerned that they are too high-poking, they know that they need to try to keep their promises to reduce government spending and to put the health reform in place.
These party lines are already evident in the first reactions to the recommendations of the Commission on the deficit, which include tax reform and the raising of some taxes, as well as the raising of the retirement age and the reduction of government expenditure.
Vice-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own opinion, have so much to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that they cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan an official recommendation and they are very much fighting to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the body, as there is little room for manoeuvre or sympathy for compromise on financial matters, at least today.
Galston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party meetings when the Republicans challenge Obama with regard to the state budget, taxes and the health system, later followed by a phase of greater two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It has been proven that, despite the partisan of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as it happened in 1995, then both parties must take care of the public response.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change the course and seek the compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Today, partisan and polarization are greater than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Congress Republicans than at that time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a mere foreplay for a much wider choice in 2012.
In this way, the courtesy that is being shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But on both sides it will take a lot more effort to find a common denominator on the issues that still separate the two.
Sidered US document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The city's control lies in the hands of the "claptocracy" and it passes on part of the bribes and the protection money it collects to the Kremlin. Thus, in February, the American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the State Security Service are pressing for high protection money so that they can keep their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it is said.
They collect money not only from legitimate business, but also from organised criminal gangs.
Each layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called "the vertical of authority" - takes its part of the money that the leaders migrate up.
The memo, which was sent under the name of the ambassador John Beyrle to Washington, was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accused him of corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is hardly any evidence that in the meantime it would have been cleared up.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who has a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected corruption allegations for years, and he has won numerous slander charges against such accusations.
In September, he told a Russian TV station when he was asked for a documentation that suggested he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt, and this has resulted in polls.
But it is unusual that, as in the Ambassador's report, individual people are called, and it is not heard that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct connection of the Moscow government with crime has led some to call it" disturbed "and to the conclusion that the government acts more like a claptocrat than a government," says the memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy a" kryshna "(a term from the world of criminals / mafia, which literally means" roof "or protection), which covers the police, state security (FSB), the service authority (MVD) and the public prosecutor's office as well as the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is in the top position."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second stage."
"Last but not least, the Ordinary Criminals and the Criminal Inspectors are following at the lowest level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups in some areas close a gap because the city does not offer any help."
The report further says that the FSB is collecting money from the largest companies and that the police are arresting small businessmen.
A source, that is, "said Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organised crime), because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, the protection of criminal gangs is no longer as required as it was before."
The memo notes that while the collection of funds is comprehensive, the protection itself is not very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who don't pay find their business closed very quickly - due to one or the other.
Medvedev has talked several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who go to the Kremlin with cases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, Director of By, a Moscow Commission of Experts, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Country-wide, estimated By, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country is ranked at number 154 in a recent investigation into the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organisation Transparency International (countries are listed by "the least corrupt" to "the most corrupt").
The revelation of the memo of the American Embassy, which happened after Moscow's late evening, will certainly cause maladministration within the Russian government, although, as Luzhkov can be accused of the mistakes of Moscow, it can also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that the problems are solved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and was angry with the disclosure that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it is about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't expect this to be done with such an arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge Veterans forced to confront the past
In a light-lit, stressed classroom with dirty and dazzling walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built it, of the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butcher," the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in the northwest of Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges that developed infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the government, many years of supporters are being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed the victims to face the public with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that for the first time told children of former soldiers the story of the Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a joint tribunal of the UN and Cambodia first condemned a former member of the Khmer Rouge, when it sentenced the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng Torture Chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, the fear among the Khmer Rouge Veterans Alnlong Vengs grew, making their efforts to reconcile and reintegrate into Cambodia's society more difficult.
"There is still a rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the documentation centre of Cambodia, an independent organisation that explores the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It even divides families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of diseases, revision or hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and the Pol Pot-Ied government crashed in 1979, the remains of the regime and his military fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement capitalized.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and the jungle of Cambodia, Ta Mok moved to the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-funded peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to move to the government, leading to the capitulations of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not given up, was arrested by government forces in the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh, where he was waiting for his trial.
When their benefactors no longer protected them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the smashing poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though a few elite officers of the Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts because they put down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers.
"These people have benefited very little from the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng
"They are anchored in the utopian agrarideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who had joined the Rhmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before he settled in 1998 to live a life as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The current Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister, to justice.
The order of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue other actions beyond these four cases.
This has not helped to alleviate the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculation have focused on In Chaem, 64 years old, who had been district chief in Manteay Meanchey Province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she had told representatives of the documentation centre of Cambodia that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damms, a project where thousands of forced workers probably died.
On a hot evening in the Chaem came back from work on the fields to their wooden house on a dirty street outside of Anlong Veng.
When the sun threw long shadows on the spoiled grass, in Chaem it refused to discuss its past at the Khmer Rouge.
If the court were to invite her, she would refuse to leave, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, there would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain if the court were to charge more suspects, although experts and historians are discussing this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia has to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk from the documentation center.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means the breaking pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together so that we can understand everything."
The centre created the first school book approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As often in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connections to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the judgment," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are condemned by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court gradually gain influence, "he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Up in the Dangrek mountains, a road overgrown by shrubs and covered with plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty sheet roof.
Pol Pots body was burned here after his death in 1998 on a pile of tyres.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a cell phone salesman on the edge of the street, said she didn't know much about the man who was burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later in the day she wanted to go to Pol Pots's last resting place, where she will take a bush of mature bananas - hoping that he will bring her luck.
Belarus agrees not to continue to collect weapons-capable uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer be able to collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical part of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarus's Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The US government had for years tried to convince Belarus not to collect high-enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring.
But US government officials told Washington Post that two secret agreements have been made with Belarus in the past two months to remove 187 pounds of weapons-capable uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the subject, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's "Nuclear Security Summit of the 47 Nations" of April, which Belarus had excluded.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next 2012 summit.
"I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat in the Nuclear Security Summit (of 2012)."
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important and important step" by Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to keep high-enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weapons-capable, and less enriched uranium," said Lukashenko then.
"This is our raw material... we won't make any dirty bombs out of it and we won't sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the US a few months ago when it expressed interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first attempt to remove the uranium of Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was light-lit, say official.
It was loaded into a special train that is more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and disposal factory for, say official.
The second start was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane according to the officers.
The US government is paying $14 million for these efforts, with most of the money flowing into Belarus's research with low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust," which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy, who is working on global risk reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Proliferation Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-fuelled uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of high-enriched uranium.
According to the joint agreement, Belarus intends to dissolve its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the US have been tense for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's harsh respect for human rights.
But the statement of Wednesday suggests a possible approach.
"Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announced that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a key issue in the improvement of bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections from the Spanish Government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaeda prisoners across the Spanish territory to Guantánamo, as shown by a telegram from the U.S. Ambassador to Madrid.
This is reflected in the documents encapsulated by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily "El País" (by cable). It is added that the former Deputy Prime Minister, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, called for the Spanish Government to be informed "to prove that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, in which the aid to be subject to human rights abuses was charged in a dozen countries, including Spain, the former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed.
The Deputy Head of State admitted that the Council's report "met Zapatero in the absence" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain had no objection to the secret service flights over Spanish territory."
"You just want to be informed," in order not to "be surprised unprepared," says Aguirre by cable.
The former Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the Ambassador that the Spanish Government "did not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government had little influence as they were in the hands of the judges."
In January 2007, the public prosecutor Vicente González, on the one hand, gave the message that he would not block the judicial initiative to apply for the declasification of the documents of the Spanish Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Minister of Defence on the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any burdensome or sensitive information," the Ambassador said after a discussion with the prosecutor.
However, the US was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the disclassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent researchers will complicate our efforts to disrupt the treatment between governments," Aguirre complains.
At a lunch in March 2007, at which the US Ambassador and the Spanish Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, took part, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges were very much concerned about their independence and did what they thought was appropriate," he had given his employees instructions to avoid "inflated rhetorical comments to make the tension go away."
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the PP's approach to this matter.
"Despite its generally pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt that the US government has tolerated or deliberately ignored Zapatero's actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the US government," he points out.
The child killer says she has complained on the Internet about the "moods" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when this was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in a Galician way"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki."
Under this name, which she has from a small point of view, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least one friend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The notifications are from 2008.
To understand these, one must know their love life, which the daily ABC reconstructs on the basis of testimonies from its family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman established a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrial in 1998.
She was holding for a year.
Shortly after she had dissolved her relationship, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his old man never had him run a DNA analysis.
She had a different relationship shortly after.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Louvery, a neighbouring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their news it can be concluded that their love relationship broke and they separated.
In March 2008 she is alone in Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came here to work."
"When I told him that, he liked it, but now, of course, he knows what it means to be alone with the boy all day and not to be free, to do and to leave what he wants."
Later she mentioned a message she just received on her phone: "I want you to come back this month or send me an address to which I can send the boy to you."
She's complaining, "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back."
In May she talks about the return to her village: "This week I will go there, but I will only stay there until the 19th because I have to introduce myself to work on the 20th if I do not want to lose it."
She says she'll take her first-born if she's okay.
"He will be with the one he must be with, that is, with me. I will never leave him with anyone but my mother again in life," a doubtful intention when considering their bad relationship.
In July there is another mail.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the first of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other, he is not."
"On the one hand he is with me and he likes the place a little, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day."
She's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have less expenses for the nanny."
On the 17th: memories and complaints.
"A huge kiss from César asking me when you'll be here."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. You see, if he wants to, he'll find me, such a mess."
On the 30th one more: "The boy is fine. He goes to a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Víctor, her current partner, there is one: "He shoots money at me."
On the Internet, in anim- and mangablogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked, and in which she called herself "Muki, the prison officer."
"Terror a la gallei (heading)."
The last man who lived with her, a sworn hunting officer, explains that he has a sense of conscience because he feels guilty.
He can't believe everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica was transferred to the Palma Province Prison yesterday from the Centre for Prisoners in Menorca.
The mandatory defender, Carlos Maceda, said that she could not remember the course of the matter, "and she did not intend to harm the little one."
Before that, however, she had confessed to drowning César in the bathtub and hiding his body in a suitcase.
Defense and D.A. 's office requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November, the PP could play a crucial role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and Members in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking forward to the parliamentary elections - or not. Its expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party has achieved in these elections is usually twice as high as that in the elections in Catalonia.
The Catalan People's Party received 610.473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure was only 316.222 in the 2006 regional elections.
On the last Sunday the PC reached 384.091 votes.
If this rising trend - the result of the redirection of the voting share of the PSC and the binding of the PP's electorate - should continue, the PP analysts predict that in the parliamentary elections the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressmen, while CiU 4 (now it has 10) would also gain (it has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 members (out of 25).
These calculations show the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose a Member - currently it has three - while ICV could hold its Members or win one.
However, if the election calendar is to be maintained, the next date with the municipal elections will be in May 2011. Even then, the People's Party (PP) can be the voice of the balance in order to put an end to the socialist domination, in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the City Council of Barcelona, one of the largest city administrations: EUR 661 million for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the Socialists cannot reach a majority or use their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not surprising that this party will lose its representation in the City Council of Barcelona, where it would have to reach 5% of the votes.
The PP, on the other hand, recorded an increase in its share of votes in the four provincial capitals and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the main role in Tarragona's change, where they had ruled in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, along with the PP.
And Lérida is the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Ángel Ros, has good relations with Mariano Rajoy - they met several times during the last election campaign.
In other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels and Reus, the People's Party has also experienced a significant increase.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 city administrations in Catalonia and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell got Al Qaeda thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian police officers of the Barcelona Police Department, who were arrested by the police, formed the jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, which provided various Al-Qaeda groups, including the "movement for the liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Lashkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the bombay attacks, which in 2008 claimed 106 deaths - with passports.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior has given these investigations a great deal of importance, which goes so far as to ensure that the "Operation Kampai" has been "weakened" in the world and thus "its ability to act."
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were falsified and then sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy of Al Qaida was composed, so that their "fighters" could go beyond the borders of European and other Western countries without a penalty.
The exposed cell is not the only one of the jihadist network that has been active in Europe. That is why, in addition to the Thai investigation bodies, other European police units have been involved in the investigation, and it is not possible to rule out that in the EU area there will be similar attacks in the next few days to those carried out in Barcelona last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), another was arrested in Thailand, where the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt were arrested, as well as the Thai Sirikantaya Kijbumrung.
They had led from Bangkok the cell established in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - some of which had been destroyed in 2009 - stole passports in particular from tourists according to the so-called "International Islamic Front."
This means that the documents were issued on the name of men aged 25 to 45 years and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have a visa stamp.
It is stressed in research circles that until now no links between the people arrested in Catalonia and the bombing in Bombay have been established, although the author of this attack was "Lashkar e-Taiba," one of the recipient groups of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that several days before the assassination of Catalonia, several thousand dollars had been sent by means of a money transfer company, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "command," which put an end to the lives of 106 people.
The police have confiscated an extensive documentation.
PP calls for a postponement of the tax agreement by Mas
The President of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to personally present Artur Mas with their conditions to support his appointment as Prime Minister of the Generality, which are not different from those already set out during the election campaign and can be summarised with the priority of economic recovery and the absence of regional independence, such as a financial compensation agreement, which the regional leader intends to propose at the height of his mandate.
The President of the Catalan People's Party turned to Artur Mas, who gave it the 18 Members she had won last Sunday - a paragraph that is more than sufficient to feel indispensable, because the candidate of the CiU civil-regional party is dependent on at least one of the opposition parties to vote when he takes office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter into in the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible entente with the PP, but the talks that Mas is currently having with the other party leaders are about Catalonia.
As far as the party leaders of the PC are concerned, it calls for "all the discourses relating to the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" to be put in the back, as well as an agreement on financial compensation between the state and the autonomous region, similar to that in the Basque country, and even to a referendum by the head of the party of CiU.
Both political leaders are mean to make the built-up political apparatus of the regional administration more lenient and to abolish the inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations on the entry into office of Mas are discussed by the PC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidarity Catalana).
The nursing home confirms that the deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the old-age home in Olot do not rule out that their caregiver killed more than 11 older people
The people responsible for the old care home of La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference in which they found out what the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmés - the caregiver who had killed at least 11 old people for whom he was responsible - had done to the institution.
The head of the nursing home, Joan Sala, joined his lawyer, Joan Cañada, in court and announced that "La Caritat wants to sue the responsible (for the deaths)," but "the law and our liability force us to accept the process and civil liability."
The institution must not only accept a loss of social vision because it had not identified the criminal acts of the nurse in time, but also now pay a high amount of compensation, which is calculated by the representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime went back to August 2009 and that he had been killing since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - because he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but that the formalities were handled by phone because of their age and diseases.
The head of La Caritat denounced this point and said that "no remaining measures could have been the reason for the incidents."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "there is no evidence in the dispute of negligence of a person other than the accused."
The baptized man already confessed 11 murders yesterday and declared that the first crime was committed on 29 August 2009 and that he had killed the second old lady one and a half months later.
In this case, he killed insulin with an overdose, unlike the first crime in which he had given a mixture of various sedatives.
The head of La Caritat said that the access of staff to the drugs was difficult to control.
The insulin syringes and the sedative cocktail were used by the nurse in six out of nine crimes to free patients from their suffering with death.
But the results of the laboratory tests will indicate whether Vila lies and indeed chose a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned them from the inside by giving them bleach, as he had done in the confession of three women he killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, there is no faith in the caregiver's statements, not even in the number of committed murders that could be more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to suddenly change his approach after eight successful murders.
They say they made them available to the judiciary for this reason and to inform them of the scope of these incidents.
Threatening of the European Central Bank (ECB)
The investors responded sharply yesterday to the threat of ECB President Trichet, who warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
The risk increases of the euro area countries have increased dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility of the ECB being able to deceive itself and the euro has hardly been added to issues that cause concern.
Yesterday's events are typical of an illiquid market, which is recovering to the extent it collapses, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose its fear for a long time.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank asked us to reverse our liquidity measures, which the ECB will have to withdraw for the fourth time tomorrow in two years, and probably some more in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan to purchase government debt as they were ineffective, as well as the abolition of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. It was only intended to maintain a one-week untimely access.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and to maintain quarterly calls for tender with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity by at least June.
We also expect the program to continue to purchase bonds and to issue a stronger signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent response of the markets from yesterday will be discarded and if half-hearted we insist on taking back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As at the ECB meeting in May, at which the Bank confirmed that it would not consider the purchase of sovereign debt instruments and that the markets would then collapse, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, she showed her teeth, and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, thus provoking a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one year's state titles in Portugal was rather weak.
The government's asset management spent only 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve, reflecting a change in the perception of the markets according to the words of Trichets.
In Ireland, the figures of the debt gap of Allied and Bank of Ireland have been published.
The sum is estimated at about 10 000 million in the short term and possible further 15 000 in the short term. There is time until February to get private capital or these banks are nationalized.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after it had not seen the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures in the framework of the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the government must receive parliamentary support for its new budget, and since it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has made her discourse more moderate with regard to the summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, where political unity is required to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth Symphony of Beethoven.
The Spanish President of the Council presented yesterday the plan of measures to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions, such as financial institutions, reduction of the government deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. Measures that sound in the ears of investors such as Vivaldis, four seasons.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange has increased by 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchange.
Compared to February, the response of the government and the Spanish central bank was fast and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a significant auction of a three-year public debt loan that will benefit from the Trichet effect, which is why we are relying on a strong demand, which will eliminate all doubts about our debt-to-debt ability.
For Spain, the application for aid would be a self-sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to markets would be closed without a time limit.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with Caesar's wife's motto: "Now not only does being count, but also the appearance."
Only courage, we can do it!
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of Eulen, at the request of his children, contests the shareholders' meeting of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owner of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, does not fail.
David Álvarez, founder of the company's gurp, will challenge the general meeting of the company of El Enebro, which will take place at the request of five of his seven children on the 16th, as he considers it "absolutely void." His children will try to get a majority to control the administrative bodies of the company - the owner of the Bodegas Vega Sicilia vineyard.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are preparing the legal measures for a new chapter of justice in their fight to control part of the group.
The founder of the largest company service holding does not seem to be willing to give up the control of the El Enebro institutions in his legal dispute.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who were appointed members of the Board of Directors at the shareholders' meeting of 18 January this year, which is already registered in the trade register as being contested.
The general meeting of the shareholders of El Enebro, convened by the judge of the commercial court number 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has created a new thunderbolt in the lap of the Álvarez family.
The call of the judge to convene the assembly is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the shareholders' assembly.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to be recognised by means of legal excellence, fraudulent acts and abuse of law" as official speakers.
This argument is the basis for the convocation of the assembly in the afterward, in order to declare it "absolutely void."
The same protagonists, who are in discrete silence, tried to convene a meeting in June without success on a judicial basis.
At El Enebro - company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets - David Álvarez 'seven children control 100% of the capital.
However, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group demands the right of use over 51% of capital.
This is the real background to the matter that the judge has to decide on in the hearing on the case for which a date has not yet been set.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since Red Bull ended up in the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history has been marked by surprises and successes in this exquisite universe.
At the beginning, no one paid attention to the newcomer and, despite his steep rise during the last seasons, all of them at the end of November all insisted on the victory of Fernando Alonso's Ferrari.
Without trying to reduce the skills of the German pilot and world master Sebastian Vettel or the power of the Renault engine, the "secret weapon" that the Multi Siemens put into the hands of Red Bull, thus creating a winning team, has become a legend.
In fact, it is a powerful software to simulate processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes that are not related to car racing.
This information programme, called the PLM, was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy works and high-precision instruments.
The aim is to ensure a true reproduction or simulation of a product or process before it is actually built in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's cameras, Sukhoi's aircraft and Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russworm, head of the Siemens Industry Department, explains that using this software in the Formula 1 factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" can design and implement the changes and improvements that are found on the races and during the tests.
Russworm says that in 1992, ten technicians worked on average in the racing stables, which could introduce no more than three or four improvements in one season.
The Red Bulls team today employs 180 highly qualified young people. With powerful computer systems, they carry out analyses and all possible changes to the racing car.
The Siemens manager stated that the PLM software was able to analyse and improve all components of Red Bull's racing cars, except for the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit set by this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that a Formula 1 team can spend for its races in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and production of his racing cars in a 50 km from London.
These are two buildings in which visits - especially by journalists - are strongly restricted.
All that's happening there is top secret.
The staff includes 580 people, including the two pilots, World Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy-drink manufacturer places in the service of its participation on the race tracks, other protagonists, whose support is invaluable and whose knowledge is zero.
The head of technology at the plant, Steve Nevey, stresses that five years ago it was possible to say that progress in R & D for racing cars contributed 50% to the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values have changed, and the technology is 85% of the success, while the pilot's contribution is estimated at 15%.
Nevey recognises that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDV, because they "are not predictable gladiators."
HP will open twenty own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated his first exclusive shop in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a sales network consisting of twenty shops, each with 80 to 100 square meters, which the multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company will agree this initiative with the existing 16 sales areas in the multi-brand business, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice-president of HP España, Helena Herrero, referred to the converted shop at the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American group intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, of which 20 are established in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to betray the forthcoming new openings, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next target.
The vice-president, who is also head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of opening the shop is always the same. It is based on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group advises these and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products to touch). In Europe all shops will look the same.
HP is also responsible for the training of the shop staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchising system and stressed that the exclusive sales site network was intended to "optimize the customer service and advice of small and micro-enterprises when purchasing and after, even packaging."
The Barcelona store has a pioneer pilot program that will solve the technical problems of HP devices with a guarantee.
An online service is building a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way, we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed especially for small and micro-enterprises and private customers, as large companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service," said Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants to 'steal' his rivals in three years
The managing board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but first rejects a new liquidity crisis and preaches the end of the debt war.
However, it envisages a fall in interest rates which banks are trying to offset with increases in fees and loans prices.
Sabadell expects to catch a million private customers in three years - a subject still to be established.
Sabadell has found the way to take the next three years to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year plan in 2011.
The objective is not only to survive without the use of public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by one million private customers - 700 000 if you take off the customers that will lose the bank - which is the big challenge that this bank is facing, because up to now it has paid more attention to its business customers than its private customers.
This year it has added 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Their market share for private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is the increase in productivity, that is, austerity, cost reduction. The challenges that the Bank is facing will be presented together with annual financial report.
Only a few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has upset all the banks' plans worldwide.
This year, Sabadell will complete its four-year guidelines for Optima, which was initially designed for three years, but as a result of the market situation it was extended by one financial year.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main objective of the bank.
At a breakfast organised by the APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with a wide range."
The manager assumes that Spain would only be "slow" out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to create "work" in two or three years' time - essential for the survival of the banks.
Even if it assumes that the war on liabilities - which will penalise the margins of interest - will go away, the risk increases that banks and savings banks will have to pay for their liquidity-related emissions will already be turned to the price of loans in order to compensate for falling profit margins.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural and will put pressure on the loans."
"We didn't turn the cock off, but the interest rates are very high," said Guardiola.
On Thursday, Banesto already issued an order to its branch network to limit the granting of long-term loans and to increase interest rate differentials (see Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently following the statement "to increase the fees," but "within a competitive framework."
Sabadell's plan is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate business.
It is not for nothing that he assures that in Spain "larger companies are needed."
"In the coming year, everything will change," he assured.
It stresses that the need for capital is currently "huge" and does not exclude that some Spanish financial institutions will fall into red figures.
He considered that the FROB could replace the money market in the event of captital increases.
Having assured Sabadell that Sabadell could also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he dissatisfied the argument of some bankers who already predicted a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing could be put in circulation, but in contrast to the events in June, it was possible to achieve short-term financing through repos and thus to stop the crisis.
CECA excludes a second wave of merger of the savings banks
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a fusion wave of savings banks and stressed the speed with which the sector is being restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks did not have to take part in the first phase. They held the second round.
On the other hand, the Director-General of the Spanish savings bank association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, said that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered a second round, but it was an adjustment."
"Most of it is completed. It may be that instead of seven, we have thirteen or fourteen, but all important processes are already completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has strongly supported all processes."
At a breakfast organised by the Association of Directors and Managers of Aragonia (ADEA), Olavarrieta said that the concentration process "was carried out as soon as possible and that we must be satisfied with the time-limit set in previous times, not now, in the framework of the Banco de España business plans," he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million each is an historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent, and they are now much larger, and we have met the Basel agreement."
Olavarrieta said, "There are a number of unsolicited opinions about the slowness of the process, which revealed" unseriousness and insanity, because "Banco de España is asking us to complete the process in due time before the end of the year."
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "perhaps" in the world, and added that those who doubt this "without deeper knowledge" would do so.
The manager noted that in the current economic cycle, we need to "not worry" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks that have been through a "very important" concentration process that will be "carried out as soon as possible."
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed very well the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but at the same time set conditions for the whole of the European Union.
The tensions on the markets have led to a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has submitted new adjustment measures, starting with tax reductions for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of temporary work companies or the abolition of EUR 426 support for the unemployed who do not receive unemployment benefit, up to the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the Deputy Prime Minister, Elena Salgado, with the help of former President Felipe González, supports the criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis.
How can these processes be understood?
It should be anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her public relations work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
In doing so, Germany is taking on a fundamentally new perspective for the design of our future, which collides with the maintenance of the old traditions of a large part of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second: The re-introduction of the German Mark - although this is more like science fiction at the moment - is supported by a large majority of public opinion, about 50% of the population.
The third: a redesign of the euro according to German proposals. This means more macroeconomic control; strict financial management; punishment of the countries that are breaking the rules; possibly the setting up of a number of countries and the extension of the costs of potential adjustment to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been drawing off for some time now. Therefore, there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits, and the German government took out a constitutional reform to prevent this from happening in 2016.
This was the first sign of the dispute between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign was the Central European country, when Merkel was painfully pushing out the decision to save Greece.
At that time, this was strongly criticised, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, public opinion and published opinion were absolutely against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last October, Merkel has come out with a clear position and calls for a reform of the European Union's agreements to enable a country to be saved while at the same time requiring private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position was considered to be anti-European, as it led to the Irish crisis and all the following.
But their proposal, although a little bit of a waste, has been adopted, and in the next few months we will be participating in the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures to take place from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to exceed it.
It says to everyone that, even if unpopular measures are to be taken now, there will be no longer the old functioning of the euro from this date on.
2013 will be the year of birth of a new currency area in which the countries in question are severely punished, can be forced to declare themselves incapable of payment and in this case the private sector must take over part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we have to take a hard growth course, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
The other alternative, based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as was pointed out by Spain in the period of boom, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do bad not to understand.
It is not just a question of reducing the government deficit to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to cheat on ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will be more peaceful.
And that we will make use of the opportunities we are offered by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has understood this as well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) indicates that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in his own house has been prepared.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not look like something would change that.
Among the possibilities that are considered, the fact that we need to leave the euro area fully blocked with little serious countries is not excluded.
In this case, Germany could still tell us it warned us.
Sports and regulatory environment
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventive spirit, but not the will to circumvent a sanction.
The alleged exclusion of two players of the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game of 23 November against the Ajax in the Champions League resulted in a lot of ink being shed about whether it was an unsporting act or not and whether the two players might be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is generally known, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and as the Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will comply with the required penalty at the next league game against the Auxerre and thus enter the next game phase without cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished the coach of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often found in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten but in this sport-followed rules.
Part of the upcoming debate on the present case is that a team of the Real Madrid Football Club (who preached in his hymn of nobility and honor and had punished his players for similar incidents on other occasions) played the main role in this, and the dramatization by Mourinho, who has added an episode more to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate is about whether this practice, which is not explicitly forbidden by the Statutes, is contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether these acts are a rule circumventing. Indeed, this approach is in keeping with the Statutes of sport, but it seems to be circumventing its meaning.
In this case, the damage caused by the sport spirit should be examined.
The spirit of sport defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not threatened by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the opposing players from taking an unjustified advantage of the counter-team.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we normally mean by a misplay or a delusion, because the circumference of the rule was not carried out secretly to avoid a sanction, but it should be as conspicuous as possible to be punished by the referee.
The players waited and took the penalty joyfully.
Another question is what kind of advantage did the aggressors draw from the intentional fouls.
It should be stressed here that the rival was not put in a less favourable position, nor were the benefits of the game to be played, because the obvious result of this action was that its own team had to continue playing with less players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have these players.
The advantage is, obviously, that the players start the next game phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, up to a certain degree uncertain advantage, as the team could eventually be eliminated. In addition, the players will receive a penalty with this approach and pass into the second card cycle, in which they will leave with a card less than in the first cycle due to the accumulation of a card.
This does not make it so clear whether this is really an advantage.
In the end, such practices are not directed against the sport spirit, which includes strategic decisions in order to make the most of the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to circumvent a penalty (that would actually be a clear case of rule circumference), they wanted to choose when they were subject to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding or escaping from it.
Although the limit between the gift of invention and the regulatory environment is blurred, I believe that this is a clear case of the gift of invention.
I have the impression that the polemics were created as a result of two factors: because they were two self-exclusion and because of the type of provocative rule transfer.
The damage that has been done to the principles of sport through these actions is less ethical than rather aesthetic.
Offer offensive to the customer for group Christmas evenings in Barcelona
This year, the dictatorship of the calendar will drop an avalanche of reservations to the days of 16 and 17 December.
The parties paid by employees themselves are spreading. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are also group evenings in the pre-Christmas period that lead to the restaurant and leisure industry of Barcelona. But as a result of the economic crisis, they trigger a price-offensive to capture the customer segment, which is the big mass: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, the asked entrepreneurs and associations confirm.
In order to make the accounting more complicated, the calendar (New Year's Eve falls on a Friday) has dropped all orders into the week of December 13, with the result of an avalanche of reservations of dinner to two top-class (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times started, many companies have stopped group agreements for budgetary reasons.
In order not to have to give up this tradition, many workers pay it out of their own pocket.
Whatever the economic situation, low prices are required, the President of the Barcelona Restaurant Board, Gaietà Farres, confirms.
The representative of the umbrella association does not dare to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think about it a lot before they make a reservation."
"They would like to go out, but they pay great attention to the prices," he stressed.
The business will go well with "offering quality at good prices with good service," he adds, and reminds us that customers are saving in times of crisis, which is why prices are most requested by 25 euros.
A survey in various central restaurants shows that the evening of December 17 will lead the providers to the collapse.
The Soteras group says that the requests for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would be booming. The group has adapted its menus with full offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
For another leading group, Andilana, who has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the property of the calendar has led to early reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made the impossible possible to maintain the previous year's price with menus for every taste from 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Grup, the head of El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 local people, one does not lose optimism after the second quarter of the year, the revenue is blooming again and good, though concentrated on a few days, prospects for the Christmas business are seen.
Sources of the group highlight that the 18th will also be an overactive day with groups of friends who are celebrating Christmas.
A Christmas menu for 30 euros or more has been added to the six group menus. It is the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than the previous year and in return want more details, such as Cava.
In some companies you can see green sprouts, which is why the employees are invited again, which gives the impression that the groups are back on the rise.
The vice-president, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel on the part of the Fecasarm (with concentrations such as the bar, restaurant and leisure association of Barcelona) and notes that the reservations are quite "lively" in total, although the customers "make a maximum."
The fun at the party had not been reduced, however, no matter who pays.
The Pakistani nuclear programme arouses great concern in the US
Islamabad "produces nuclear weapons faster than any other country."
Disclosures of Wikileaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department, revealed by the Wikileaks Internet portal, confirms the enormous concerns of the Pakistani nuclear programme Washington.
On the brink of the clear and juicy details that the documents on the content of the talks and the way in which the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad provide, they reveal that cooperation between the two countries on nuclear security is not being strengthened, but rather "reduced" and that the unstable Asian country produces more nuclear weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country."
In particular, the character of the Pakistani nuclear programme - that the weapons are not assembled, but are stored their parts in order to make their destruction difficult in a possible attack - prepare Washington sleepless nights.
The following risks include the Ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of the former Head of the National Security Council, James Jones, to: "The proximity of some nuclear installations to the area affected by the Taliban, the alleged spread of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material."
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenal and missile programmes is no longer considered by the US, but also by Russia as an exuberant and reason to be cautious.
"Pakistan needs to hire strictly faithful personnel to monitor nuclear installations; because of the low educational and cultural levels, extremist organisations have more opportunities to recruit people who are working on nuclear or missile programmes," said Yuri Korolev, the Russian Foreign Ministry's expert, in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
New to the documentation revealed by Julian Assange's Internet portal is that cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation is slowing down and the increased speed at which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the Embassy, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," explains: "There is often no transparency; there are no answers to aid offers or they are rejected."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, State Intelligence Officer for South Asia, confirms that "despite the economic disaster Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country."
The Ambassador Patterson asks Washington during a visit by the chief army leader, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "make it clear to the responsible that" Pakistan's army has to stop his tacit support for terrorist groups. "
On the hunt for Wikileaks boss
Obama appoints a high-level leader in the anti-terrorism fight to prevent new revelations.
Interpol issues a red warning for the persecution and discovery of Assange.
All that is related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth in which the facts are difficult to clarify.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" for the "discovery and persecution" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
Besides, it's not new, it's from November 20th.
It also has nothing to do with the last disclosure of more than four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian has to face in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, "the police would know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
On the 20th, the International Police Authority, based in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after the Swedish authorities received the power.
The 188 Interpol countries are obliged to identify and find Assange, "to arrest him for the time being and to deliver him."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, according to the organisation, many Member States consider the red warning as a free letter for an arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to remain.
The approach was outraged by Assange's lawyers, who were most interested in publishing a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference.
They also recall that Assange applied for the exit from Sweden and was compared by the prosecutor, who was given the appropriate authorisation with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the security chief of Stalin.
"This is like a hunt, not a legal persecution," is charged with writing.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia is charged with the innocence of her son - Assange is staying in an unknown place, but not silently.
On Monday he gave an interview to the head of the magazine Time by Skype from an indefinite place. During the interview he requested the resignation of the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proved that it was responsible for the order of North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus have violated international agreements signed by the US, it would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not sure why we should focus on the opinion of a type with a website," he explained to the channel CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a high-level anti-terrorism officer, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document revelations.
The attempt by the speaker of the President Barack Obama to pay less attention to Assange is in contrast to the opinions expressed by conservative politicians and commentators in these days.
The Congressman Peter King, who will chair the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives from January onwards, has asked the State Department to examine the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organisations "to confiscate their funds and to pursue anyone who supports or contributes to them."
Tom Flanagan, advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to withdraw his statement that Assange had to be "murdered."
"Obama would have to turn him into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was who leaked information in the government, he is guilty of betrayal and all that is not execution is an oath of mild punishment," he explained to the station Fox.
Puigcercós is looking for peace in the ERC with an eye wink
The Republican leader allows the party to have a secret vote on its continued existence in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to avoid, for the most part, an internal turmoil in the ranks of the ERC, which is undirected after the loss of 11 Members and half of the voting votes.
The party president is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weakened as its mentor himself and will not cause him the same head-breaking as other former currents.
This is why the leader of Esquerra, with an eye wink, is trying to win the new critics, which would secure his position up to the next local elections.
For the first time yesterday, the more than 200 regional Council members of ERC announced that they would be able to speak in secret about his whereabouts in office.
With election papers, not with a high hand.
If the Carodists wanted to give the president a ticket, they could do so without having to fear reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and that of subjection among his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would feel unconfirmed with half of the votes plus one, and he added without giving percentages that a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod Allies are asking the President more than just to make his office available to the party, an insufficient gesture as Puigcercós controls the top organ of the congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force back, they will agree with the board on a plan of action from now to May.
To this end, they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document, which will be put to the vote by the Council on 18 July.
Their intention is to vouch for Puigcercós. In return, this is to promise to present the Congress in the autumn of 2011, which the party's top considers to be a fact.
The party president of the ERC is of the opinion that the "polyphony" damage to stability and he once and for all strives to enable the organisation to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article that Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovació considered it a fact that the party president was supported "in exchange for different objectives."
He counted five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the board to ensure that it represents at least 90% of the party's members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC finally give up the assembly principle as a function.
He is thus in favour of a reform of the Statutes, which will allow the congresses to hold with elected delegates.
From the end of the assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - Puigcercós' team, which was already fighting for the last two congresses, is as obsessed.
In fact, at the 2008 Forwarding Assembly, the party leadership was entrusted with the review of the principle of assembly at a Congress to deal with the reform of the Statutes.
This date is still pending, as the internal rest of recent years has not been advisable to address this matter.
Now, without the critical sector, the time could have come to reopen this issue and to complete it forever.

Next to him, the police found a cardboard with a message.
China maintains its targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
The representative of China stated at COP16 that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon tracks and that it would maintain its offer to reduce 40-45% of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020, assures Su Wei, the country's representative at COP16.
At his first public appearance at the United Nations 16th World Climate Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon tracks and to change its industry.
He said that in the last four years his country has invested 245 million dollars to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its objectives, but would work with the international community on this matter.
He said that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all aspects, progress has been made, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which includes the objectives of reducing emissions of gases, he said.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the authorities of the states had worked with those of the central state and the municipalities to achieve the energy-saving objectives, the effective use of energy and the reduction of emissions.
He also stated that a number of multiannual plans have already been launched or completed, both those financed by the Chinese Government and those that received funds from other countries.
For example, it referred to the programme for the effective use of energy, which has been introduced over the last five years and which had received investment from the United Nations (UN), the government and from private hands.
There is also a provincial-level project on climate change, another on the exchange of traditional light bulbs with energy sparrows and another on the weakening and adaptation, he said.
Martin Krol, the scientific government advisor on climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts were far greater than would be commonly accepted.
He pointed out that the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China were six tonnes per person, while in the United States it was 100 tonnes. China is responsible for a total of nine% contribution to pollution.
It also makes unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. The energy efficiency has been increased by 20% over the last five years and another one is to be done by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN said that the former panist party president had the right to turn to the National Commission of the Order and to demand what the law would give him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos had been right and that the former party president of the PAN had the right to turn to the National Commission of the Order and to demand what the law gave him.
In an interview that took place before the Gabino Cué Monteagudos, as Governor of the State, he stated that the exclusion of Espinos was a decision taken at local level.
"It is an independent decision of the Commission of the Rules of Procedure in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right, in his case, to refer to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional in order to make a decision by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he said it was not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance with the presidential candidate never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional would emerge from the internal vote on the next 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that was never on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a precursor to the municipal election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The panist leader said that the PAN is looking back at 71 years of dialogue, so "does not scare us from internal competition; on the contrary," we enjoy it and it strengthens us, "he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the or the best chairman who would need the Acción Nacional for the next three years, which is why it would give the staff "to those who would decide the Council."
"I am very unconcerned and open. I would be proud to give each of the five to the president of the party."
He predicted that the party's recovery in the last elections of 4 July would be reflected in the next elections, although "it was not time to think about 2012."
"Now it's about supporting the Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would carry the flag and observe it throughout the country. That is why "many hopes and desires are placed in them and I am sure Gabino is at the level of the requirements."
When he was asked about the criticism of the PRI at President Felipe Calderón for his discourse in his four-year government, César Nava called on the supporters of the PRI to reflect on the six-year period of former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, they should finally come out of the closet," he said.
He is of the opinion that the German Government's holder of expressions such as those he could make in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no ban on mouth and even less censorship.
Obama is committed to the law in favour of undocumented students in Twitter
"If you are in favour of the adoption of the Dream Act, call your senators and press for the adoption of this law," the President of the United States tweeted in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported national mobilisation in support of the Dream Act - Law on the legalization of undocumented students with a message on his personal blog in the social network Twitter.
"If you are in favour of the adoption of the Dream Act, call your senators and press for the adoption of this law," said Obama.
His brief communication contains a cyberlink to a more comprehensive document that calls on the public to contact their senators, as the vote of the law is imminent.
"With your voice we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he stresses.
The news was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all the votes for each law, except the extension of tax reductions from the times of Bush and the financing of the government would be extended.
Such a blockade, which was announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican Senators, could have an impact on the coordination of the Dream Act - Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START Agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
On the blockade of the Republicans of the Dream Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs said that he would trust that once the tax issue has been resolved, a timetable for the other projects could be established.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax issue must be settled before the end of the year..."
"I believe that we can make an agreement on this at any time, and then we can plan the process of the rest," he said.
The president of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would request the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act law, which would allow the initiative to legalize undocumented students to be voted in the Senate from next Thursday, although the next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act, or the American Dream Act, would legalize about 800 000 young people who emigrated to the United States when they were not 16 years old, while the last five years have lived in that country and are registered at a higher education institution or the army.
But the advocates of the law need sixty votes to adopt the initiative, which is why they depend on the voices of a handful of Republicans. At the moment, the organisations of the advocates of this project are organizing an intense influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, of which the majority support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, has announced his support of the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act must have several Republicans on their side if other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
The most controversial Republicans are the from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they said they no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had spoken in favour of the law, John McCain, has not yet defined his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, the analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is facing the greatest obstacles.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Lust in the Language' was a walk in which the participants made themselves strong for the story
"I understand that with the sex in the language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated Spanish-speaking literature and used the subtitle of her question on this occasion (at another event the round table was dedicated to the sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "brings us into trouble," the Argentinean writing spat sweet to the audience, which was mainly made up of young people who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table, hosted by Marisol Shultz, in which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and then identified the Schultz as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking to find out what a "wound" is, and goes from doctor to doctor, of whom she does not receive an answer but guidance for the guide of her story.
She leaves the insectologist convinced: "Patience is not my strength, maybe this is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist who took her breath in the middle of the course, and who explains to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: "the wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the story is sigh and closing that it "only learned from the wound that it is really open and does not exist." But it is convinced that the desire for language and its traps are mixed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful story, which he called 'praise of invention', and in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned but discovered.
With allusions to magic realism, he tells of a famous sorceress who touched the clouds, brought back far-travelled men, or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a turning back and reported of America, the great novel that from the very beginning did not miss his own chronists, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticised the abundance of stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), mocked the premonition of witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as true, but in other ways the history of America would never have been told - with imagination that even the feeling of shame came away."
However, he points out that "it is the crazy and the liars who best imagine things," where reality and lie approach each other, where one no longer knows which side the story belongs to, where the fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls it the 'tradition of Cervantes'.
"We have inherited from him to be what is told."
When Mayra Montero was on the line, the writer commented and praised the diversity of interpretations to which the invitation of the Fil to the round table 'The finger in the wound' had contributed.
The Cuban and Puertoran woman dedicated her contribution to the great wound of the social violence that affects her country - as well as all Latin America - as a result of the fight for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit, not intentionally planned commitment," she said, after stressing that literature is communication and commitment that is building between the author and the readers as in a "chemical reaction."
The evening was decided by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also "the finger of the committed writer in the wound of the writer."
He noted that in a fast-moving world, intellectual habits and the control of consciousness also run out on dogmatism, and it is forgotten that "there is a little no behind every confirmation and a little yes behind every denial."
"In order to be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we must nuanced: and nuances often meant to put their finger in the wound and to harass those who feel much better when they think in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also to harass the powerful who prefer to divide the world into black and white, he noted and invited to rediscover the meaning of writing.
Romano is fighting for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced Auf's and Abs in his career, but he played three decisive games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end of the game, two different styles are also in contrast to those of their respective trainers, and their encounter, marked by opposites, is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced Auf's and Abs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has kept up well, which is why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentinean has played with the medal to the second champion, he has left one step behind the winners and surprisingly he has performed consecutive final games with the same team.
The santistic street reached the first final game as a coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the reins in his hand, with which he suffered a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', in which they played against Los Diablo, Ruén had to take a setback again, as the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros went undecided after 210 minutes, but at the elfmeter he came forward with 3-1 and got two ways to take his title, but in the end three of his players missed the 11 steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two final games with the Diablo Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he does not want to be persecuted again by the misfortune and free himself from the evil spell to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirms that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection that I give up, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important thing," said the taxpayer, when he was asked about the lost endgames.
The last final game he still has in mind, he assured him that he has learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from it is that until the referee does not whistle the end, we cannot celebrate, we are on the line prepared, the players are also, because the last time we were prepared with two elfmeters to leave, and I believe that this is a lesson until the game is not finished, there is no reason to celebrate."
To know that this series could be decided by eleventh shooting does not concern him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at the eleventh shooting, you want to end up in the regular season, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately, fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes because of nervousness or the fierce desire to keep the title in your hands, which left us something for this final game, and we hope that it will not come this time."
It is in Romanso's power to be no longer just a second champion and to taste for the first time the glory that the titles bring with them.
The US changes the rules for obtaining a visa
The persons must present themselves before their interview with the consulate to the service agencies for visa applications; costs will be reduced in this way.
From 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa will change in the United States Embassy and in the Consulates.
The new procedure requires most applicants to present themselves to the visa application services (ASC, the initial letters in English) before their consultation at the consulate.
The staff of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which shall be verified by the consulate before the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of handling the visa is reduced because it is no longer necessary to pay separately the time-limit agreement, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is issued.
The applicant shall make only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the equivalent of 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with application (including visa for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for traders and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa do not need to have a conversation at the consulate, they only have to imagine the next ASC where they will submit their documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
As the biometric data are collected in the ASC, the applicants who need a second date for the consulate will remain there for less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo no longer have to pay the 26-dollar service premium.
Further information on the new visa application procedure can be found on the following website: http: / / mexico.usembassy.gov / boletines / sp101201 _ Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the discovery of alien life
The North American Space Agency launched a press conference to present tomorrow a finding that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The United States National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of alien life.
The finding will be presented tomorrow at 1: 00 a.m. at a press conference at NASA's headquarters in Washington by astrobiology experts, which is a science that explores the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When the press conference was convened, NASA assured that it would "present a supervisory find for the search for alien life," which triggered speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that it can exist in hostile environments that have been thought to be uninhabitable, human-like creatures. The hypothesis has been raised that these could turn into intelligent living beings, like people, if their living conditions improved.
It seems to be a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too toxic for all forms of life, as the lake is highly arsenic.
In some way, the microbie uses the arsenic as a survival resource. Taking this ability into account, the chances increase that there may be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
If these organisms change the arsenic, according to the astrobiologists, it has been shown that "there is actually another life form, a second life form, which is different from that known to us."
The space agency will announce tomorrow, on Thursday, at the press conference the actual range of its information.
The conference is attended by the geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who examines the possibility of life on Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies Titan (the largest moon of Saturn), asking whether his chemical composition resembles the earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Patrón form an opposition block
With the reform of the organ law on Congress, the two-party system was introduced, they complain.
The 60th legislature had just begun, and an opposition block was already installed, led by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who presented himself as an independent, and the four were in question: the entry of the 'two-party system' into the Chamber.
Before the beginning of the inaugural meeting of the 60th legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergence, Ezequiel Reynolds Esparza of PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo were against the reform of the organ law, as they would thus be excluded.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now it would be two people, the same number as parties that controlled Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, the coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Bureau set up by the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the parties PRI and PAN had institutionally introduced their political position with these reforms.
He said that in the next few days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, and they would assume that political will was the case, and if they did not, they would be subjugated by both parties again, which would put an end to the opposition coalition.
"So far I have come (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, which do not even look back on taking into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergence said that there were similarities with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralist group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued that, after being monopolistic, Congress should now be "duopolistic."
"It is not the spirit of law reform that an eternal two-party system should prevail in Congress."
"For the beginning, this group will start with five Members, and they will talk to other colleagues to make them more," said the Convergence Member.
Ezequiel Reynolds Esparza of the PT said that the Congress has now turned into a 'prey' for two in an allusion to PAN and PRI.
"Before that, it was only one party, now they split it up in two."
Mr Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the Members and to assign them their place to the negotiating table.
"We must not leave out five, which are likely to be nine Members, because the five, which are currently being seen as divided into different groups, have decided to join us to take our place at the negotiating table, because the reform that has been carried out and agreed by the others, has left us outside and we do not agree with this reform."
200 000 peso more for "the delivery ante'
The city administration of Mazatlán pays another check to the controversial owner of the company for electrical material.
A further check on just over 200 000 peso in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
This means that the sum paid to the owner of the company for electrical material in the second half of the year is 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the page for greater transparency of the city administration, this check was issued on an amount of 200.144.56 peso with the number 9258447 last November, with the purpose of "settlement of open invoices."
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already announced that more money from the community would go to this supplier. It is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because it sold at excessive prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount that is still owed to her and, as a result, the number of checks that are still being issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing was bought from her, just the debt is paid, just like the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "appeared" in the last quarter of the year "again": September 24, two of October 15, October 19, October 29 and this last of November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as is required by law when a company is called into question by ASE in order to avoid other administrations applying for its services, the treasurer assured that its services would not be used again.
After the Noroeste newspaper had published on 25 July the examination of the checks issued by the city administration to its suppliers, it was announced that, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year term of office of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid more than 10 million pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also shops with Jumapam, where she collected checks worth more than 3 million peso.
Tourist places need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the foreign tourist accident due to the bad condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in the break-in of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism industry of Mazatlán requested the authorities to pay particular attention to the areas that are in a bad condition and are taking a bad picture of the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, Chairman of the Zona Dorada Association of Traders, recalled that at different occasions it was required to maintain the destination and to turn the bad conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad condition of the roads and walking trails had had had a negative effect, as tourists would come to sway and see the disorder, so they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
"The politicians don't know what it means to close a company one day, and they don't think about how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn't be doing the construction in this way slowly and unplanned."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist had made attention to the lack of prevention and the lack of maintenance on the part of the city.
"The community must take on its responsibility and avoid that this is happening again. How it should do this? Well, through a preventive maintenance instead of everything in retrospect," he said.
"We are looking forward to having a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area, it must be maintained, we also have a right to a clean habitat. The city administration must change its strategy to maintain the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unwell and unfinished," he said, "for example el Escudo y el Venadito von Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. A good product must be offered, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean, and the tourist attractions constantly in the shot," he added.
"These arrangements have not been given enough attention and this type of incident is only what is obvious to everyone: maintenance is urgently needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, subsecretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist places of Mazatlán, because they would not be used properly and created a bad picture.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought to the fore together with the city. To make the city clean, neat and attractive for tourism should be a priority.
"Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that need to be cleaned and cleaned to make them attractive to tourism and to bring them to the inventory with which we are promoting this destination.
IP demands results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that Members take the great responsibility to give an example of a better Sinaloa, which is facing many challenges.
The business sector of Mazatlán calls for a worthy Parliament, free of agreements between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is upset and is facing major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Parliament was inaugurated, composed of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of the Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergence and another of PVEM, which makes a total of 40 representatives of the people.
The new members of the Congress of State are expected to do a clean work, to feel committed to society and to the different social groups that are dependent on responsible parliamentary work, and to not repeat the same patterns of partisan and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Enterprise Coordination Council, proposed that the new Members take the great responsibility to give an example of a better Sinaloa, which is facing many challenges.
"We hope that Members will really exercise their right to act free of agreements between the parties, because it is common practice for them to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, thus turning into carnival agreements between the leaders and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We make sure that they do a trustworthy job and, above all, work for society and their groups, because it was the inhabitants of Sinaloa who told them their trust in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, President of the Hotel Association of the Republic of Islam, believes that one of the major challenges facing the 40 people's representatives is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in any way promote job creation."
With regard to the tourism sector, he called on the new Members to give the Ministry of Tourism the necessary importance in the state budget to promote it.
"I understand that it is the Ministry with the second least resources, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
The tourism projects must be allocated funds, state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been recast in previous legislative periods, must be updated.
The Holy King is sought
The children of the Coronado Valenzuela family want dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys.
It will be difficult for parents to meet these wishes on the next three-king day, because the budget is no more and no less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give them the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and the clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from hand to mouth, because the father has no fixed work.
"Sometimes hard times are said because my husband has no job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... I go to the street with the greens in the afternoon to sell," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaide would like a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo wants to have a 'monster car' for some time and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana proposes clothes of the size of one-year-old.
"(José Alfredo) told me," I would love this monster so much, "but I answered him," Let's wait, boy, "because it was very expensive," Cayetana was sad.
For the older children who were at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
The 11-year-old María Guadalupe has the size 12; the 10-year-old Isaiah has the size 10, while the 8-year-old Miguel has the size 8.
14-year-old José Juan is missing tennis shoes. A couple in size 5 1 / 2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help you realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King is wanted' by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the Noroeste newspaper.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, the 10 house searches in the Estria administrative region were carried out in the context of the dismantling of a production and sales network of cannabis.
Fourteen people were arrested and will be charged with various charges.
The house searches were carried out in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where they were intended to serve mainly drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that have served production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec Security Police.
A total of 11 men and three women were arrested, two of whom were the main drivers of the drug ring, from Sherbrooke.
The arrested people are supposed to have appeared in front of the justice building in Sherbrooke hours after their arrest.
They could be charged, among other things, with the accusation of the production of cannabis, its possession for sale, the conspiracy and the service of crime.
These house searches were carried out as a result of a long investigation, which took place for over a year.
"The information received from the public authorities has enabled us to carry out these arrests," said Mr Ruel.
The 70 police officers of the Estria regional investigation unit of the Quebec security police, the Sherbrooke police service and the Memphémagog police authority had participated in this police operation.
The secret immigration could be easily followed
The draft law of the Conservatives, which, according to the government, is intended to deal with the problem of ships loaded with secret immigrants, is likely to be stalled after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I strongly oppose this Charter."
"I am holding with a party that has put a tie on your feet," said Michael Ignatiff, head of the Liberals, at the end of the weekly Caucus meeting before the gathered Members.
The Liberals claimed that the draft law, which allows any person who is identified as a transport of illegal immigrants to be detained for up to one year, would lose the Canadian legal and freedom constitution as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he would not be able to support the draft law, as he was opposed to the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government is doing," said Mr Duceppe.
The criticism of the immigration question of Olivia Chow, NDP, has turned the critics away from the hand, who demand that their party did not be steadfast enough to the secret immigrants.
"The neo-Democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and this is exactly what we are trying to enforce by means of another draft law, the C-35," said Chow.
We do not therefore support the draft law of the Conservatives because he is looking for the blame of the refugees and is holding children captive for at least a year, "said Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians strongly inform the Members that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these criminal transactions that affect Canada and which treat the country as a foot-abuser."
"They expect Canada to take hard action," said Minister Kennedy.
"The government has not announced any vote of confidence in its draft law that could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
However, a conservative has said to the QMI Agency that the government would call a vote to ensure that every opposing Member immediately declared himself to his constituents.
The new unit does not find unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a new standing unit on the fight against corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public investigation committee on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, said that this idea was not from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
Since 1870, the metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday has surprised more than just one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed in the least at the meeting of the Permanent Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutils.
There was also no lack of the fact that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois, qualified this announcement in terms of public security as "a" hatched rabbit "and" a solution properly built at a table end. "
Minister Dutil, for his part, had turned to those who feared that political power had too much influence on the question of future unity.
"You will see the result when we announce it," he pleased to affirm himself.
"You are aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
"The more Mr. Charest insists on trying to prevent the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he said.
"The only way to form a committee of inquiry is to resign Jean Chare," said Yves Boisvert, lecturer in ethics and policy systems at the ENA (State University for the Training of High Administrative Officials).
In order to get out of this deadlock, he proposed to the Quebec that financial audit be given a special mandate to enable it to carry out appropriate research on corruption and secret agreements.
"One should be able to extend the mandate of the audit," he decided.
He also considered that the Quebec of audit control could give the same power as Commissioners, which would also allow it to make people a statement.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the government's drawers.
The Quebec will also require Ottawa to change the criminal law in order to better address this type of crime.
This demand is from the Supreme Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this type of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, for his part, his colleague from the Justice Department, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain amendments relating to this dossier.
During Operation Printemps 2001, which concerned the groups of motorcyclists, 131 people had been arrested, although the criminal law had not been revised.
As a result, Ottawa has enforced the law against gangsterism.
rivers under strict monitoring
Several rivers continue to be under strict surveillance due to the high rainfall that has been happening in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the administrative region of Mauritius, there was a landslide on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated in a preventive manner.
In the evening another landslide took place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road has collapsed in itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, strong rainfall from 40 to 70 millilitres of precipitation has been found in several regions.
Between 20 and 40 more millimeters of rainfall were expected here according to the regions until Thursday night.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
There had been a total of up to 100 millimeters of rain.
As these rainfall can be added to the snow melt that has already been collected in certain sub-areas, the crossing of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebecer Security Service issued warnings about the flood alarm on the Ouareau and Ahigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentine mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière become the object of flood monitoring and remain under observation.
In the Lanaudière region, the heavy rainfall caused the overthrow of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and also in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a bridge was demolished due to the strong rainfall.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains in alert and closely monitors the situation, says Security Council Annik Bouchard.
The Quebecer State High Water Centre, on the one hand, issued on Wednesday warnings of the strong rise of several rivers, in particular of Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Ahigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partly granted
The Quebec Radio Moderator Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Supervisory Board for Radio Standards (CCNR) because of its controversial statements on social care and Haitian, as well as because of its failure to speak about radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team would have the right to express their own views, but certain statements would have included "inaccurate information about social care and unjustifiable negative representations of the Haitian people, as well as such an unheard-of speech that is not appropriate to the broadcast during the day."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion about suicide, including the spread of the names of two persons who committed suicide, is contrary to the code of broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning the comments made during the 2008 and 2010 programmes.
The first order was filed following a complaint by the "Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec."
The activist organisation had complained that the amounts mentioned in the consignment were inaccurate.
The moderators should, instead, provide solid information as misleading.
On the subject of suicide, Moderator Stéphane Dupont had expressed the opinion that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of members of the Supervisory Board had concluded that the message given was that suicide should not be considered a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the relevant consequences of the programme" Dupont le midi "had been a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate way."
He was therefore not given any credit for his person.
The last point concerned the statements relating to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had had a media-effective discussion in this respect, which caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had declared that he had not donated to Haiti because it was not certain whether the needy would actually receive the money.
The Supervisory Board considers that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative representation of the Haitian people.
"I have already lost my three-day suspension sentence in this matter."
"My file has been a virgin for a year and a half," said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board denies the spread of an unheard-of expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM has acted "beyond its obligations."
The consequences for the radio station, which, among other things, had been to report its decisions once during the first time within a three-day period, are minor.
A King of the Kung-Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montreal Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The Athlet, which brilliantly in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in the kickbox and in the Thai box, now increases to the Tatami and to the world's boxing rings in search of new challenges.
"I started fighting sports in Algeria 12 years ago, such as Kung-Fu and Kickboxes," said Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008 to develop among the professionals.
I personally seek the fight of all places, because for those who do not like the ground fight, as the mixed martial arts present it, competition in North America is rampant. "
Recently, the one who worked as a security officer and the company UPS had given his rivals bad news, in which he received two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Championship of Amateurs, held between 23 and 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have won the victory in the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he said.
"I am currently preparing for the World Cup in San Shou in China."
"The fighters from each category had been invited to the last World Cup among the first four."
"I was getting a bronze in Toronto in 2009."
"I was in Vietnam in 2005."
"In 2007, I finished the tournament in China in fifth place, while I became third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It is worth mentioning that I have made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines from China, in which fists and footsteps are allowed as well as ground-throwing.
The two fights usually take place on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most prestigious boxing fighter who has emerged from this kind of martial arts is the American Vietnamese origin Cung Le, who is well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer was to keep a single event in his career, he would certainly call his presence here at the Super-Tournament "King of Sanda," the Super Bowl of the Kung-Fu.
"This competition is the highest and most respected in China," said the sympathetic son of a bitch.
"It is a bit like the equivalent to the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"That was a great experience."
In the semi-final of his category (80kg) he won his first fight before losing in the final.
"He who defeated me was a real professional," he analysed.
"There are four members per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet each other in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer their forehead to crown a single champion, the king of the Kung Fu."
450 million in contracts without an invitation to tender
Hydro-Québec has agreed to grant project planning companies $450 million in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, there is a consortium, consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely that of the project management, to a total of 295 million dollars without a tender.
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance," was formed in 2004 as a sign of the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector's responsibility to surrender this important hydroelectric project to a total of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the "Énergie gérance" consortium received the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, the use of corporate consortia is a serious ethical problem which raises the risk of distortion of competition and an increase in prices.
"This is a new way of a cut-off game and defies competition."
"This means that instead of playing the game in a secret way, it is now being carried out in an open form," said Sylvain Simard, Member of the PQ, at the press conference yesterday.
In the early morning, Simard raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult to understand how public interest can be served in this way.
In the afternoon, Minister of Resources Nathalie Normandeau had responded to this by vehemently disagreeing that this Treaty had been a cut-off game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she bet by encouraging the PQ to go "unfairly" and "miss it in hardness."
She said it was "the least" that the PQ apologized.
The model of the consortium is common practice worldwide.
It is usually such a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to combine their expertise on a bid for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity in terms of its work size.
The construction process is under way and is to be established by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without any competition being able to take place; there had already been negotiations.
In addition, even in relatively simple projects, the model of the Quebec consortium is no longer an exception.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" said last week, the model of the consortium used in the field of construction engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A short overfly of the Quebecer company register allows to name more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be of permanent duration.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA +, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, and Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and there are several dozen of them, leads back to one and the same legal person, that is to Dessau.
As far as the "Énergie gérance" consortium is concerned, Minister Normandeau has stressed that "the territory of Baie James is subject to a special labour market dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been paying special attention to this fact since the 1970s."
Réal Laporte, the great employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that has made the case about the fact that the project management contract was approved in accordance with agreement.
"If you make an invitation to tender and there are few candidates, your prices will speed up."
"So you have two possibilities: either you take the people who are on this march and tell you that a satisfactory agreement will be negotiated at a good price."
"The idea, however, is that the price is not crucial, but the expertise of the people," said Laporte.
This contract approved to the "Énergie gérance" consortium is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved either by the Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" had more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts that were approved by companies or their branches, including in particular resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had made 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without including their participation in "Énergie gérance."
All these contracts have been negotiated.
The total amount is $449 783 344, including the contract with "Énergie gérance" over $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had made it clear that the four companies that formed the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the "Parti libéral du Québec" were well known.
Minister Normandeau had made it sound that the PQ was equally linked to the companies she "financed" before she specified that it was rather their leaders.
Barometer-conscious consumption - The "green" label is not trusting
Green, but unturned skeptical.
The Quebecer consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but also in the marked brands or eco-labels to control its choice.
It is a pity, although it is in a media-effective universe, where information in favour of a more responsible consumption is only so mixed up: the barometer of responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to complain about, an inadequacy which is identified as a brake on its commitment, as demonstrated by the first reading that was held yesterday.
Although they have driven the consumption of so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, the Quebeckers still seem to have little credit for those who are trying to sell them.
Two thirds of the Quebecer population admits that, in fact, they do not believe in the environmental performance of the companies as well as the green business advertising, the instrument of measurement, which was chosen by the responsible consumer centre of the University of Sherbrooke, is the same as that of the green business promotion.
Another finding: half of the consumers doubt the reliability of the official certificates attached to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that claim to be environmentally conscious, the barometer says.
According to the same pattern, the political discourse on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebecer population.
However, the information on responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this consumption segment, which is currently being revived by almost a third of the quebecer consumers.
In fact, emptiness and dubious nature of the information have been dampening the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, one third of the quebecers of the declared performance of the green products and services that they are being asked to hand are defiantly opposed to.
According to another communication, over half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products in order to express their conviction.
According to Barometer, they had also preferred 61% purchases from traders in their district and the purchase of food grown in their region.
Green and responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption this year had reached a 64 of the maximum value of 100 - the homo consumption of the Quebec loves to present itself as the king of recycling, trying to reduce its traces of the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
However, the social and environmental awareness seems to stop in front of its car, according to the barometer: just 28% of the quebecers have indicated that in 2010 they have used public transport or preferred the driving centre to demonstrate their ecological interest.
The introduction and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behaviour survey, which feeds on the clichés.
Public Prosecutor's loan for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebecer government, which was invited by the Société Angus and the company Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the cinema complex eXcentris, agrees with a cooperation, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The development company Angus and the company Parallèle, which had hoped to make a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the cinema eXcentris, which was part of Daniel Langlois, on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent, did not seem to receive what they asked for.
The government has accepted to be involved in this matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebecer government offers a bond at a lower level than the initially expected, which could create an existential solution to favourable conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources that can be removed from the state's rumours.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by the Quebec last spring, and the request has been corrected as a whole since that date.
A proposal, together with an action plan, has already been sent by the President of the "Société de développement des entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St Pierre, who runs the eXcentris file.
Several days ago, he had sent her a final report.
However, the counter-proposal of the Cabinet was sent to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallel and Angus now have until 31 December time to respond to this.
In any case, the premise of the donation of the State seems to have been really pushed aside.
Let us recall that the Quebec owner community of the cinemas and cinemas had opposed a direct state investment in support of the acquisition of eXcentris by arguing that the Minister of Culture did not have to provide financial assistance for real estate projects there, which he did not also provide to other cinemas.
However, several other market participants in the segment did not claim substantial economic aid.
After the self-financed construction of the cinema, the head of the cinema, Daniel Langlois, had presented the car park in the premises of his cinema complex for over ten years under great difficulties, which could justify the exemption from the State Treasury.
The lack of cinemas that show independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to keep his clients on the line.
The Société Angus and the company Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top, are in charge of a privately funded campaign, of which they hope for a total of $700 000 to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one screen continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The aim of the future acquirer is to reopen the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the presentation of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux."
But Christian Yaccarini did not call off the newspaper "Le Devoir" and you ignore what he and his group think of the proposals that have been made to them that have been corrected downwards.
The secret of the complex-shaken Canada
The new American diplomatic lines, which were spread by WikiLeaks, amaze the secret of what the United Nations considers to be under the minority of the Canadians to the Americans, but with the same blow they reveal the latter's sense of superiority to Canada.
As a result, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian electorate in the course of the election does not have the meaning of Canadian-American relations, and they believe that President Obama's visit would have helped the conservative government to enforce their 2009 budget!
The four new messages between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly distributed yesterday, offer even more spicy details than the mere material content on which one has to nibble.
A link dating from 22 September 2008, that is, during the period during which the federal campaign was in full swing, reports on the point at which the United Nations no longer participates in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
The great surprise of David Wilkins, the American ambassador in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations of this situation.
"A minority complex, which is almost inherent in the Canadians, may lead Canadian political leaders to talk about internal issues of everyday life rather than to push the United States to the black Peter in this election (as in the 1988 campaign on free trade)," he explains.
The United Nations, he concluded, is therefore "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent but potentially too threatening to speak of it."
The Ambassador understands this "deafening silence" all the less because the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically," he says, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party chief to lead such an essential relationship that the voter has as a key factor in the way he goes."
The other expression of this feeling of importance is read in the communication sent by Terry Breese, a businessman in Ottawa on 22 January 2009, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to ensure that the government continues to have confidence in the federal budget at the beginning of February, where Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, which was created by a 30-40 billion-dollar education programme," explains Breese.
He had not mentioned that the government had had to postpone the parliamentary meeting before Christmas in order to prevent Parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and that the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed training programme.
Another communication, dated January 2008, written by the Ambassador Wilkins, tells Washington of the increasingly negative picture that the dramatic series broadcast through CBC are spreading from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can observe little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or also abduction for the purposes of the CIA's muscle protégé.
Another communication reports in detail on how Hillary Clinten, with her French counterparts Bernard Kouchner, asked at her first bilateral meeting whether Europe was prepared to take up certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner should have answered the question with a yes, but on the basis of an individual case-by-case decision.
The end of the meeting, described, "he has given the Secretary of State a paper in terms of Omar Kadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised to re-examine the file."
Finally, let us note that the spirits are heating up on the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close-standing consultant, had explained through CBC that the people responsible for this massive leak should be "killed."
He had been talking here about Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global plan for the renewal of lighting
The UN yesterday in Cancun proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas (CFCs), which is close to one third of the additional reduction to be achieved in order to stabilise the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the major concrete projects which the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments from the developed countries.
According to the plan submitted yesterday, the main problem would be avoided in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of CFCs released to the earth due to the lighting if the white-burning pears, which are still a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or better, by light-emitting diodes (LED).
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the global fleet's exhaust gases.
In Copenhagen last year, large exhaust gas issuers such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global emissions of CFCs from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, it would be necessary to deduct 5 Gt from this balance sheet in order to stabilize the 2-degree increase in climate from today to 2020, in order to prevent it from getting out of control.
In the white-glowing pears, 95% of the energy in the form of heat is released, and the remaining 5% are producing the light.
With the compact light bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, and with the new LED light bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced by twice again.
The compact light bulbs hold on average between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those put on the market this week by the manufacturer Philips - this society, by the way, has participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white light bulb, which is an indication of the potential savings of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that this completely new light bulbs give very little heat, they can also work with a control resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact light bulbs have reserves, because they contain mercury and that they have to be disposed of as a special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, except for producers providing a place of acceptance.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact light bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which cause much more mercury to produce the electricity wasted by the white-burning pears.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power plants produce 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report sets out in detail the profits that each country would make thanks to this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars a year in the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power plants, the construction of which would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast Expected the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential election of the Ivory Coast right after their time-limit.
"The Secretary-General stressed the need for the independent election commission to maintain its work and to announce the preliminary results without further delay," a press speaker from the UN Head stressed.
"It invites all parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast to demonstrate their responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the Electoral Commission had passed the deadline set on Wednesday at midnight three days after the election on Sunday, without publication of the results.
About forty minutes before the end of the season, the President of CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue with the work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, many calls from all over the world have been made to the effect that the CEI may finally call the name of the winner of the second round of elections under Laurent Gbagbo and his opponents Alassane Ouattara.
The Gbagbo camp, however, expects the cancellation of "fraudulent" votes in the North by the Constitutional Council, which was achieved by the former rebel camp of the forces nouvelles (FN) during the coup which had failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Ivory Coast presidential campaign, had confirmed that the maneuvers of the FN to intimidate the voters in the north of the country had deterred the President's supporters from going to the election.
The entire election could be cancelled if the actions brought by Gbagbo were taken by the Constitutional Council.
The Gbagbo counterparts, however, are now more of the opinion that the highest court of the country is not neutral, as it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely linked to Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the North, who denies any connection with the former rebels, has considered the delay in announcing the election results to be "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, even though he has not gone so far as to request victory.
His allies reaffirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost; and that he is making a complaint to the Constitutional Court after the election commission has been prevented from publishing the results illegally.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was held for the coronation of the process of association and reconciliation of a country which had been divided into two parts for years.
The United Nations had warned the Ivory Coast politicians on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for these in the event of possible outbreaks.
Laurent Gbagbo had received the first round of elections on 31 October with 38% of the votes against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who had been the top candidate for the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment in France remained stable in the third quarter
For the purposes of the International Labour Office (IAA), the unemployment rate in France is at stable 9.3% in the metropolis (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), the provisional seasonally adjusted data published by the Federal Statistical Office of Insee on Thursday.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is 2,631 million.
The figures for the second quarter were 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7%, including the overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
In more detail, 3.4 million employees of the French metropolis were not employed in the third quarter, but wanted to find work, including whether they were operational every two weeks or not, or whether they were looking for work or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, + 0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% with the inclusion of the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed according to the IAA.
In turn, the elderly have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+ 0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482 000 of the over 50 years of age, 6.6% with the overseas departments being included.
Only the 25-49 year-olds were able to benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage points over three months, + 0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After a discussion of its calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office of Insee has not published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
On the other hand, Eurostat, the European Union's statistical office, continues to use this method and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% in France for October (including overseas departments), compared with 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and arrested
An investigation was initiated against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône region (PS), and he was admitted to the prison in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation into the public and suspected of fraud markets.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with the suppression of social assets, the defamation of general goods, the hegemony, the complicity in corruption, the unlawful bribery and the possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to speak on all the questions that the prosecutor will ask him instead of spreading brain spiders."
"It is easy to submit a number of criminal charges to him, and another thing is to prove it," said his lawyer Florence Raul of the AFP (Agence France Presse) before hearing his client.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialiste) in the department, had given the judge a memoradum for his justification before his hearing by means of his lawyers.
A member of the Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and detained on Wednesday night.
According to the lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than keep his deposit he had to run.
He would never have known about the scope of the business or the destination of the associated funds, said Simon.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of the Aubagne metropolitan area, was also charged on Wednesday for incitement and complicity, but was then released under the obligation to stay away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to explain the facts he was accused of."
"The leading prosecutor has taken into account not to deprive him of his freedom, said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons were charged and released from prison on the night from Tuesday to Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, said Deputy Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Managing Director of the disposal company Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being followed by a court on the basis of "unauthorised influence and passive bribery."
Two public officials of the Aubagne metropolitan area, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier were also arrested, one on the basis of the title "Abortion and embezzlement of public goods by a public service officer," the other on the basis of "co-operation in the event of public money misappropriation."
The life partner of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also charged with the "healing and undermining of social assets."
Among the people who have been faced with Guérini, is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently arrested because of a similar affair of public-law fraud that had affected Corsica.
The Fathers suspect his society to have helped to wash money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the disposal sector, will be conducted in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letter in the files of several open investigation proceedings.
It is clear from close sources of investigation that the investigation is particularly focused on the conditions of the award and the operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also covers waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain cities in the Marseille urban catchment area (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace overdoes its Middle East function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was held in Iran for "espionage," held the French public in breath, put the diplomacy in alert and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
This is all under the attention of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and seen through by the newspaper "Le Monde" give some background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained to the Americans its strategy to give these advice on how to deal with their own crisis of "hostage-taking" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French authorities have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman did not have the release of Majid Kakavand, a French-held Iranian Iranian, who was sought by the American justice on the basis of trade in material for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they put the way in which the French Bureau tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making it credible that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, in a bright light.
In truth, he had done nothing in this respect.
A diplomatic telegram, edited in Paris on 12 August 2009, is entitled "Iran: French Commentaries on the way in which hostage-taking is handled."
François Richier, Elysée consultant on strategic issues, attended by Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method to her.
They told the Americans to do everything they could to bring back their own nationals who would be held violently in Iran.
"Make noise," they said, "articulates loud and clear and without exception" the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this all the more, especially as the Iranians ask you not to do this."
For "silence does not solve anything," past the discussion attempts on inconspicuous ways, the Iranians are "masters in evasive maneuvers."
Mr Richier added that the arrest of foreigners was a "common, Iranian tactic": "hostage-taking for political blackmail."
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was to be made on August 16, the day it fled to the French Embassy) "would require the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians" (EUR 230,000).
And he makes it sound, the Elysée anticipates further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that "will become more intense."
The Iranians could "arrest another of about 1,800 French citizens living in Iran in the near future," he said.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison 12 days ago, but is still held in Iran.
An information has been put into circulation: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is calling for to Iran due to illegal trade in sensitive electronic material, has been released from prison after a judge has decided in Paris.
The American Embassy, like many other observers, is asking questions about this worrying coincidence.
For Washington, which is tracking the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of the material intended for the nuclear programme, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Did France buy a cow trade?
The liberation of the Iranian against the French woman?
On the occasion of a further discussion with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assured that this was not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision," but also tried to oppose it.
"There has been a strong exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand is still under "strict" supervision of the French intelligence service.
The Elysée consultant chooses a phone number, then resets up, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "were currently in the buildings led by the Iranian Embassy in Paris."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not protect its efforts to make believe, by means of exhortations and media-organized "escape attempts," that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influential middleman role."
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and state that the manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram, dating from 25 August 2009, "the media flash of the French authorities" is summed up.
What is the basis for so much "thank you" to Mr Assad, is the Paris message.
"Despite their full praise, the French authorities admit in secret that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that led the Elysée to fail this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts "aim to confirm Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008, which was "perceived as premature and undeserving by many critics' voices in France and abroad."
"The Syrian role building" Paris "is trying to show Syria what the reward can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also to "sow discord between Syria and Iran."
The American Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier had entrusted her: "Of course we do not know whether the Syrians did anything."
"But we have thanked them, despite everything."
"This should at least cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy is receiving them at the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favour of the release of our countrymen."
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "the Cinderella," which will prohibit young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking them from access, so government leaders explained.
A draft law to encourage online game operators to refuse access to these games to young people under 16 years of age after midnight will be presented to Parliament in December, presented to representatives of cultural and family ministries.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulties with school learning and also with having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, the Minister responsible for this draft law of the French press agency Agence France Presse.
The online games were then reaccessible from 6 am.
The manufacturer companies would have time to prepare for the application of the law for a year, he specified.
The government is also looking to ask manufacturers to send down the daily time limit for access to these games to those young people whose parents ask for it, the responsible person added.
He will also provide free programs to those who wish to be able to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "networked" countries, and the newspapers regularly report on various events associated with the intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also uncontested champion in world-wide online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the expatriate country
On Thursday, the FIFA Executive Committee will appoint the world leaders of the 2018 and 2022 World Championships, a highly political choice in which the ranking for influence and lobbying are threatened to put the technical criteria in the background.
One thing is certain, however, is that the 2018 edition of the FIFA's royal discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional high castle (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be somewhat more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to win new territories (Qatar, Australia) for itself after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue to pursue its establishment in the United States or in Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of persons belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of state, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political use of a world championship.
So the activities behind the scenes are threatening to stop until the last minute.
Otherwise, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) acts offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the unveiling of the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could also have ruined the opportunities for their own country, the cradle of football, which was only allowed to win the World Championship once, in 1966.
The BBC had once again given the floor for education on Monday by sending out a documentary report that took three influential members of the Commission, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou under fire.
It is reason enough to upset FIFA and embarrass the English leaders, who have had an intense lobbying with David Cameron in the last few weeks.
The head of government is looking forward to a new edition of his predecessor Tony Blair, who had achieved the 2012 Olympic Games in 2005 for London.
Would this intensive effort be enough to revalue the image of England before the committee?
Nothing is less secure, because the duo Spain-Portugal is not lacking in trumps with its already completed stages, its expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial shadow sides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English as well as the doubts about the Solvenz of Spain and Portugal increase the chances of Russia, which, despite its gaps in the file (stadiums, hotels, transport), has become an important outsider.
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to denounce the undisputed indication of the British press's "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by the members of the Commission.
"You throw them with dirt, you try to compromise them," said Putin.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical favorites.
First world economic power, the headquarters of the FIFA main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea that have set up a very nice project separately.
But these new candidatures seem premature for two countries that had co-organised the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the World Cup 2026, which the FIFA has called for, is the approval of China, which will make the Asian chances of 2022 obsolete.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn all the registers with the maintenance of futuristic stadiums, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk, because certainty.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weakness of television rights (due to the time shift), the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
Second mandate: the openness
De Gaulle had really been stoned.
Mitterrand had made him think he was stuttering.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not have the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this one.
A mandate in the Elysée calls in the next one.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the obvious is not well on the side of the mystery that is attached to the presidential function.
So you have to pretend that there is no doubt.
In one sense, as in the other.
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chirac said that a third mandate was not excluded without believing in it.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in serious tone that he would make his decision "eventually in the autumn of 2011."
The fact that he would make the perspective of "two mandates" sound in front of the UMP parliamentarians on Tuesday night in the Elysée had therefore spread a little feverish.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The President only reminded that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year term of office to only two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time he has mentioned the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have seven and a half years with me, or at best," he explained to them in July 2009.
A new one in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the phase after that."
His words from yesterday make him no more a candidate than the day before, but no less.
If they make comments, it's for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race around the candidacy with the PS on one side.
It is not, however, the opening of the competition with Ségolène Royal that is driving Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, which many members of the PS call for a fight announcement more early than accepted.
The bad polls on the other side.
For the first time, the right-wing voters would prefer a candidacy of François Fillon by Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP about it," immediately and carefully reacted to the Prime Minister's environment.
"If he found a defeat possible, he would not be a candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin informed.
"He will always believe in being able to win," corrected Alain Juppé, who has come to an end with the obvious.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of state documents
The last meeting of the ECB's Central Bank Council last year should provide an opportunity to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least to announce the order of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to be completed at the end of the year.
The crisis of European public debt is bound to make it impossible for the central bank in Frankfurt to take advantage of today's more than tense situation on the European bond markets, so as not to cause it to deteriorate.
The political costs would be far too high.
The French Minister of Finance Christine Lagarde welcomed yesterday at a press conference the active role taken by the ECB in the resolution of the European public budget debt.
It did not dare to say whether it considered that the central bank could do even more, for example by launching its programme of purchasing government bonds.
"I keep my considerations to my European trading partners (...)."
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, on the occasion of his hearing by the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Committee on the day before, had not been very specific about his projects, but was pleased to point out that the programme of purchasing state papers on the secondary market would "continue" and that we will see at the meeting on Thursday "how the decisions are going to be made."
Only certainty: The ECB will leave its central interest rate unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the Treasury's bond purchases were doubled by the ECB last week to about EUR 1.35 billion.
And according to some traders, she was supposed to have made new purchases yesterday to Irish and Portuguese state papers.
Since May 2010, Eurosystem central banks have made purchases of EUR 67 billion.
There is no doubt among traders about the anticipation of a follow-up to the purchase price (see page 29).
The people don't expect a remarkable change in course.
If the bond operations of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB 's arsenal, the latter will still be able to cope with the full reserves in a free manner, over a period of one week to three months.
People are already working on the fact that this measure will be extended for a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will substantially change its programme."
"Otherwise, it would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, the economy of the Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit planned for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems to me more likely," he anticipates, on the one hand, Norbert Bräms, the economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its intervention in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain such a volume of bonds that revitalise the market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the relevance of the European banks' exposed position on the euro area sovereign debt markets, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must at all costs be placed on the market and act in such a way as to prevent the premature enthusiasm of the returns paid to the weakest states," yesterday an important bond holder testified.
Because if interest rates were to start to fly up, the States would be even more prevented from reducing or even stabilising their debt.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
The Berlusconi Government is going to cover in Italy
After a week of concern to Italy, the situation was a little relaxed yesterday with the fall in central interest rates to 10 years.
A return to the deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, the regional leaders, Giulio Tremonti, had qualified the situation as "indispensable" and had heard him expect a "unpredictable" weekend, but what the subject immediately disagreed.
In any case, on Tuesday, the scissors with the German interest rates would have reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy had increased to 263 points, which had caused some headlessness in Rome.
In his Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out that the gap between Spain and the German interest rates was 400 basis points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed itself as "seriously concerned" by the "market turbulence" and a possible risk of infection from the direction of Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In the clear text, this means that his problem is the reduction of economic growth and the resulting, fading-out tax intake, which would put the State at risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget budget for the Senate is expected to be 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates that the budget deficit will still be 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to the 3.9% forecast by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
That is why the call for a new budget collective, which could be used for a total of EUR 7 billion after the holidays.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says economic auditor Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, and we have been repeating this for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy with the IMF.
"At the moment there are no problems, either in the short term or in the long term, as Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A.D.R.), is calling for less stability progress than in other countries," observed Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD head of economy.
The question of political infirmity remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure from the Chamber of Members, which would allow the preferred elections to be organised by the end of March.
So there is a little bit of a favourable period for a decision to be taken on a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about the development of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde had made it clear yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I believe it was proved on Sunday afternoon and also in the evening: Europeans are clearly united, ready and committed to defend their currency and their currency area."
Although quite relative - yesterday's deduction from the interest rates of the European government bonds was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, it is not yet possible to speak of a start in the process of normalisation.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce the debt of Portugal, the most effective target of the speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which is particularly affecting the banking systems," said the people of Exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, especially since "the political time is much slower than that of the markets."
The European countries, which are well aware of this gap and of the danger that it faces, are intensifying the discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal discussions between the most directly concerned finance ministers and, in the wider sense, their counterparts to the G20 are progressing well.
This also applies to the meetings of Eurogroup and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The plan sets out the unconventional measures to strengthen the countries of the euro area at the crossroads of the markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Funds are concerned, their Executive Director Klaus Regling has already started his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform the investors in Far East about developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of his visit is not to express fundraising, he will certainly prepare the terrain for it.
The first expenditure on paper by the EU's Stability Fund is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday an official American representative of the Reuters Agency had entrusted, the United States supported a possible increase in the funds mobilised by the IMF's additional direct commitment.
Portugal and Spain, the first-row countries, are in favour of adopting structural reforms, in particular in the area of labour market organisation.
Reforms to be added to the austerity measures but to show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid take a different path than Greece and Ireland did.
Both the one and the other are at all costs to avoid having to ask for international assistance before they have established their own budget correction and decided on inevitable structural reforms that will bring them back to their trust in the long term.
In turn, European investors are talking about the options available to speed up the process of normalisation of government bonds markets.
Axel Weber, who was on his way through Paris on 24 November, had the first idea that if the EUR 750 billion mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to rejoin its own pocket.
The citizens of Barclay's Capital, as regards the market of European public debt, consider that an extension of the EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This means that the European mechanism of monetary stability, which is currently EUR 60 billion, is in place.
A Advisory Council that has all the opportunities to be carefully examined in the European capitals.
Especially when market conditions are increasing.
Snow and smooth teis: 24 departments in orange alert
The snow episodes still cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of Brittany and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in the Orange alert phase due to the risk of snow and smoothing.
The regions of Eur, Eur-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the 20 departments already in the Orange alert phase; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers dance the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows slightly on the et Ile-de-France.
In the departments concerned, snow ceilings from 2 to 5 cm are expected, and in some cases from 7 to 10 cm, and 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côte d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snow falls are considerable enough to cause traffic barriers and to affect certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the region of Côte d'Armor, several regional roads are closed for heavy transport of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac transport areas.
The transport situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the transport police, who advise to use their own vehicle only in case of emergency, and the use of some TER buses has been deleted throughout the day.
In the Picardie, the school traffic was cancelled for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were provided for in the case of heavy goods vehicles on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "calls on drivers to be very careful on the streets and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to remove 25% of their flights from Roissy Airport and 10% from Orly due to the expected strong snow falls on Thursday.
The DGAB recommends that passengers contact their airline.
The Gatwick airports in the south of London and the Edinburgh airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport sector in the Ile-de-France has been in full swing, it has been raining billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris, is to be remembered.
In order to start the construction of the SGP, the State has declared a capital allocation of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the SGP would then be able to give a part of the financial sum to the markets twice.
The first calculations have finally come to light today.
The 2010 supplementary budget, reviewed this morning by the Financial Commission of the National Assembly, contains the planned measures to raise the first part of these funds.
These are two measures: the creation of a special tax on the development and the increased taxation of offices in the Ile-de-France.
The first, it is noted that Article 15 of the draft law is "in favour of the public institution Société du Grand Paris."
This is quantified: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year."
The second is a rearrangement of the existing company taxation: "to modernise it in order to increase the product resulting from it and to overturn this increase in the Société du Grand Paris."
How much would that make?
A mystery.
This sum is not given in the text.
You're far from the 4 billion.
"It is said that the tax resources are added to the EUR 4 billion of the capital allocation that the State is making and that the Société du Grand Paris is being provided for the project," is explained.
The SGP does not find this system offensive at all.
"Since the moment you book revenue (the two taxes, i.e., the German tax), you can cover the project for over three years and then only draw from the 4 billion," it is explained.
"This is recorded in the budget and gradually deducted."
The SGP estimates that 2013 will start to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, of which 4 billion will be able to be sought for a long time, is in danger of creating a fairly moving, parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Racial hackers and emsy spies
The Affaire WikiLeaks has a double meaning.
On one side, it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal that is only a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level and gives a taste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's go in a row.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is to confirm that every file (an x-any nation) created by a secret service is made up of only newspaper sections.
The "extraordinary," American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi are nothing more than what one has been reading for months in any x-any journal (except those whose owner is Berlusconi), and the terrifying caricaturised profile of Gaddafi has been offering cabaret artists for a long time.
The rule that the secret files can only consist of already known news is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, not only in this century.
When you go to a library dedicated to esotherical publications, you will see that every work (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templar or the Roman Kreuzler) is repeating exactly what has been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (nor because he does not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who are devoted to occultism believe in nothing but what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
And the secret acts.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise he could be anything, for example, editor at Libération), who only considers what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, which the American Embassy in Rome sent to the State Department, was the same as those that had already published Newsweek the week before.
So why was such a fuss made about the revelations of these files?
On one side, they say, what every educated person already knows, that the embassies - at least since the end of World War II and since then also the Heads of Government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some small representation tasks, have turned into spy centres.
Every single viewer of the investigation film knows this very well, and it does not happen out of hypocrisy that you do so to ignore it.
However, the fact that it is to be repeated in public violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that an x-any hacker can tap the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a major blow to the prestige of the State Department.
In addition, the scandal is less of a burden to the victims, rather than to the "sharpeners."
But let us devote ourselves to the deep nature of what has happened.
Once, in Orwell's times, you could bundle all power like a big brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have turned out to be completely correct since then, where you can control any movement thanks to the phone, any transaction, the hotel, the chosen highway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if you look at what is going on today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, then the control course stops being one-sided and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but any citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as a citizen's scam - can experience the secrets of power.
But how can a power no longer be able to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is essentially a secret free from secret, as it is the public sphere that is present; but in the style of WikiLeaks to reveal that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to deprive them of any power.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama did.
What will be the consequences of this intoxication that has been inflicted on such a great power?
It is obvious that in the future, the States will no longer provide any reserved information online - that would be like an outhang on the street corner.
But it is also obvious that with the current technologies it is in vain to hope to keep confidential reports on the phone secret.
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a head of state has moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private relations be maintained in the future, and only for certain ears?
I know very well that my prediction for science fiction and romantic sounds right now, but I see myself forced to imagine the government agents, moving in a secret way on uncontrollable marches, keeping their messages with them nowhere else than in the mere memory, and also the few written information they have received, in the shoe set.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: basically, the attempt to spy on Watergate had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is moving forward like a cancer these days, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph had revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analog) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film band for band by rolling from the back to the front, and by ventilation all the secrets of the assembly, while the (numerical) CDs today allow nothing but to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macroportions.
The high-speed trains will take you from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this will take three and a half hours by plane, including the move.
It is therefore not unusual for policy and communication technology to return to car and horse.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the messages.
At present, it is the messages that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France speaks its financial promises beautifully
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine compliance with the fast-track financing promises (also called "fast start" or early financing) that have been implemented by developing countries.
And the coarse French beauty-tellers are already exposed.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed themselves to providing 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU has drawn all the registers to convince its partners of its commitment to fast-start financing: the detailed progress report of its Member States, press conference, major side-events, and the distribution of brochures.
The transparency operation is remarkable and is highly appreciated for its real value: the developing countries and civil society would like to see all developed countries doing the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, which will bring it on the right track to pay for its 7.2 billion commitment in 2012.
But when you look into the detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" to ensure that an additional commitment has been made without reaching the detriment of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the guide value that he considers best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen itself as a benchmark for those in 2009: international financing will be maintained and will provide 150 million in the framework of the "fast-start" funding for over three years.
Other countries have chosen similar indicative values, either in terms of year or conditions at the level of public development aid.
In return, France considered that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional."
In other words, there are no indicative figures for the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
In concrete terms, the overall amount of French support for developing countries can remain stable (or decrease) - France states that it will comply with its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another key element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule about it yet, and everyone chooses their calculation mode.
Some, such as France, are €1 loaned as equivalent to €1 donated.
Obviously this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often linked to the reduction of emissions, which is based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is fraudulent to present the euro that is taken as an equivalent to a donated euro... In addition, only the cost of the loan to the capital country should be considered as a commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing other than the following thinking: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million by borrowing 91.5% (EUR 389.8 million) and donating 8.5%) 36.1 million) - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only country in the EU that uses loans to a large extent.
Germany is calling for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among other things) are 100% committed to donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union is spending €1 to fulfil its obligations, France is giving only 10 cents and means a similar commitment.
Nice hocus-pocus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double flaw: in part with a further development of the action over time and in part with the reality of financial use.
France succeeds in making it believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" million in line with its promises, saving EUR 36.1 million.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (since it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitrage) could have a double negative effect; once in the EU (why do the other Member States continue to lend if it is enough?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not completely mistaken...
The chapter of early financing is only a small question for a relatively short time compared to the whole of discussions on the climate.
But it could be the drop too much in the immense machine of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
However, it is essential to learn its lesson from this first year of early financing.
First of all, France could announce a change in its accounting method for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and of balancing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could bring forward the discussions on the subject of long-term financing (another, decisive and currently discussed issue): the question of "accountability" or the way in which its loans are recorded is not to be avoided.
France could change its position in order to be as progressive as it is with other things on the issues of dispute.
So hope is based on the new Environment Minister Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about the fast-start of France and its vision of "predictability" as well as the use of loans would by nature increase the international trust base necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Pesticides taken by children
A child of 10 years takes on different chemical substances over the day 81, such a study published this Wednesday by the Générations Futures Association (former movement to protect the rights and respect of coming generations).
The association, which explains that its results "do not reflect statistically significant value in view of the small number of samples analysed, but are illustrative of the problem," had bought between July and September the usual food consumed by a approximately ten-year-old child at meals plus an intermediate meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and vegetables, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day - have been examined as well as rodents of laboratories looking for chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is degrading: 81 chemical substances, including 42 classified as potentially or likely to be carcinogenic and five classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrine impairment, according to studies by several institutions, such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if the legal limits for each chemical, individually taken substance are not exceeded in the near whole of the cases, this survey is very well understood that the reality in which the consumer is exposed to potentially carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrine disruptive factors is worrying," the Association notes.
At breakfast alone, butter and tea with milk already contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three safely known as carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that may affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, which is intended to be used as an intermediate meal for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, where the study has found traces of an insecticide that is strictly prohibited in the EU.
In addition, the hacksteak, the tuna from the box, even the baguette and the gum of pesticides and other chemical substances were also injected.
The analysis has revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform in the tap water.
At dinner, the salmon steak with 34 chemical residues was the "richest," and even the plastic plate used to warm up the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The final risk of this "pollutant cocktail" for the consumer "is likely to be underestimated," the study says.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) has in turn proposed "in view of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increase in civil diseases."
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables that are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
