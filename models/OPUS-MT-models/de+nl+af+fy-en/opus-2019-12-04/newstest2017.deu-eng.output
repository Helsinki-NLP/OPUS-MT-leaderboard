28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping centre.
The victim's brother said that he can't imagine anyone who would want to harm him, "At last he was going up again."
The body found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the medical department in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABS station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who used to work as a cook in Boston, had taken his dream job as a cook at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman of the Son & Daughter said that they were "shocked and destroyed by his death."
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painfully," said the speaker.
Our thoughts and our condolences are with Frank's family and friends in this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank first lived in hostels, but that, "things finally went up for him."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," said Louis Garcia KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone who would want to harm his younger brother.
He was a friendly person with a great heart.
It was his way to connect with his family that it was always to cook us something, to prepare us for dinner, "said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take part in any kind of argument.
He was the brother who swam with the power.
"With all that goes wrong in the world, he was this uncut diamond, which was bright every day," he said.
Anyone who has information on the case is asked to call the reference phone of the SFPD under the number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
This is what the Hollywood star has now made clear in an interview.
"I will always be put in drawers or put on labels from the outside that have little to do with me and reality."
"I myself do not wish to be always perfect and successful."
"To be honest, these things are more of a snout to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at her being considered "Miss Perfect," as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan."
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, in the form of a TV with loose dutt and Mexican food, it is said in the magazine.
She asks the question of the child's desire: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," says the Hollywood star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a child's play" Aniston is to be seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film will be in our house from August 25th.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experience on the horse is manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a little change with some colleagues with a ride on the beach.
For the 58-year-old, it was a premiere.
CHIO: "Golden Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes the horses remembered their evening, they chased home in the fast gallop to the feed drains.
One kilometer at this rate, I was afraid.
"It was not a good experience," says Langer.
And that ended the riding career again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournaments - was back near horses.
He and his family were led over the ALRV plant, and he didn't even swing on a horse for photo purposes.
Long was in Aachen for the first time and thus also at CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid provided the man from Anhausen with the Golden Sports Pyramid in the context of a small gala.
There is no lack of awards for the sympathetic athlete.
Federal Cross of Merit, Silver laurel, Champions Tour Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already nodded him.
Langer is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "for it is awarded not only for sporting success but also for social commitment."
For decades, Langer has been promoting young people.
And so he also passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US champion was inducted into the Hall of Fame of German Sports on Saturday.
The award winners include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wienenke, the leader of the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and the posthum of the handball Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious society moved to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept his distance from the big animals.
Clintons and Trump's economic policy compared to: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - that's what Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two US presidential candidates disagree on the question of tax and energy policy and on a fundamental issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
This, about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep them in doubt rather small and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wanted to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself would be quite different, says Trump.
It will have a massive back-up of regulations, and it will be strong in favour of a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has certain tasks to do, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money to do so.
That's why the taxes on the rich would be increased, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton say that they need to be invested in.
The democratic candidate has even announced the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical teaparty wing of the Republicans.
Trump could therefore still be subject to party internal discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are more clear.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and regenerate coal production in the US.
Oil production is also to be possible in protected areas so far, and the Paris climate change agreement is to be announced.
On the other hand, Clinton's investment programme specifically aims to increase renewable energies and calls for: "A country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"It will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."
But not only with regard to infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.
TPP, the TransPacific Trade Agreement, does not want to sign either.
At the same time, both of them do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply to protect American jobs better.
They are to be paid better, for example, Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
She wants to raise him to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must go up, then he says he must not be changed.
But the big debate in the coming months is likely to be more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, there is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics are prejudicing him, which would only increase the budget deficit.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants the rich to demand that they pay more taxes, and their critics say that more taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every woman who has fled has experience with sexual violence"
Sexual violence is a part of everyday life for women who are fleeing alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
There's four women in a big kitchen.
Each one has a baby that is not more than a year old.
One of them put her little son in her arm.
He looks into the room with great eyes.
His mother's staring at the table.
Until she finds out she's being watched.
She smiles and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the district manager of Condrobs, a social assistance provider in Bavaria, and deals with, among other things, the issue of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodations for single women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich women's help.
It was recently officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - even as visitors.
The exception is a guard at the door.
"It is not too much to say: every woman who arrives here has had experience of sexual violence on her flight," says Bahr.
"Men are fleeing because of wars because they are politically persecuted, because torture or death threaten them, or because their families are sending them to Europe as a means of hope," she says.
In women, other reasons for the escape are greater: "Many are secretly stealing from it because they see no other way out."
In their home country, they have experienced sexual violence, forced marriages, the murder of honor, slavery or forced prostitution.
That's what's driving them away.
On the run, it goes on.
"That tugs, for example, require a sexual action for a bottle of water is not a rarity," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who thinks that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, is crazy, tells Bahr.
Here, too, single women in refugee homes are often considered to be inferior and at worst abused.
This means that about 90% of the women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, she estimates.
"Some of the children have certainly not been born voluntarily."
Many women are so used to saying nothing.
"Or they don't dare to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too great."
Since they often do not know how to help, it needs more accommodation only for them, demands Bahr.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
The question of whether they know about a project similar to that in Munich in their field of competence is answered by some with no.
In the Upper Palatinate and the Upper Franc, for example, there is no such thing in the housing of the governments.
Even in swabs, only women who have fled are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, the government's press speaker.
In Oberbayern, Unter- und Mittelfranken there are floors or houses in some community accommodation only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodation for women only.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.
A study published for the Committee says: "It is very important that men and women are held separately."
"If there is no privacy, or if men and women are put together, violence against women can come - on a permanent basis - against women."
In particular, the laundry rooms should be separate and easily accessible to women, is the study.
How much the women feel about this need for protection can be read from the urge that exists on the house in Munich.
"Since we've been talking about our existence, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Interns strike: demands for new work-related measures
Deputy assistants have called on their union to approve new work-fighting measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to adopt more work-related measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC said that ministers had failed to respond to the concerns about the Treaty.
Assistants and medical students voted in July to reject a contract that was agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the president of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would have been "permanently quiet" to problems, which led to the Treaty being rejected.
She said, "In view of this, the JDC Board has voted to fully reject the proposed new treaty and to request official renegotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Board of Directors today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating work-fighting measures beginning in early September.
The disputes led to assistants strike six times this year, the first total failures in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA assistant doctor Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms and conditions recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which took place before the vote by 54,000 assistants and medical students, that the contract was beneficial and should be adopted.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the contract would be forced for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: An "alliance of outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to announce an official end to the eight month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile seemed narrow and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restraining conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to me to be rather the opposite.
But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cooling showed that Russia's head of state had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was wutentburn.
Putin handed out and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia.
The crime was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding confidence will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media conducted a violent, full attack on Ankara.
All of a sudden, it seemed like the Turks were responsible for everything.
The most serious allegations made by senior officials were that Erdogan's own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in Syria's areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has vehemently denied this.
But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia could record a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clearly obvious.
Erdogan needs first of all all all all friends he can get after being relieved of his office in a failed coup last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have been hard hit by Turkey - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be easier when the flights are resumed.
They count on a late-season asonic storm to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish imports of agricultural products were allowed again.
A report in Vademosti said: "Tourists there, tomatoes here."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West, as it considers its response to the attempted takeover of power to be a weak response.
In addition, the continuing grudge about the pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is trying to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian head of state in Ankara certainly won a bonus for calling for support for the elected state institutions after the attempted coup.
This is a very clear question for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of changing regimes.
The summit in this glamorous palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, one, as an analyst once described to me, to represent "the alliance of outsiders": two countries that are disengaged and ill-treated and now unite.
However, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be a sign that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents at the press conference said that they had not even fought the issue.
The President of Turkey deliberately fails to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress it.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator for Syria can be found.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster when the NATO member Turkey shot off the Russian jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
The RBS brand is to be reduced to a backoffice role, according to the bank's head of management.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the global ambitions of the bank.
The bank has been disconnected since when it almost collapsed and had to be saved eight years ago.
At this time, brand strategists "RBS" used to protect other end-user financial brands.
She supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock exchange listing will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the retail business that will be more important - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed by customers and employees in Inverness-shire during a tour.
He told the BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we will now become more a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I am saying now that we are not pursuing global targets, but local targets.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the different brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands, because how do we focus on the inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the head of the board.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would have been a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see many changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Detori reaches his 3,000th win at Newmarket on Predilection
Detori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket that brings him 3,000th profit
The Jockey Frankie Detori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He set a milestone on his local race track with his second win of the night on Predilection, which is trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner, Detori, who won Ghayyar before, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very modest.
Dettori takes the cheers when he takes the victory on predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time derby winner had 4,493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockey in modern life and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador to races, his enthusiasm and charisma has been enthusiastic about fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie at epsom a few weeks ago that he would have already made 6,000 profits if he wasn't just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has been winning in GB for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Detori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Detori has been the leading character of the British flat race for two decades.
It was annoying.
A whole series of big tournament wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and got a drug ban.
Three years ago, he had difficulties at first when he returned from his six-month lock, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to comfort his doubters and return to his best form.
And he is not yet at the end - Detori once said that he wants to continue in competitions until at least 50 years of age.
Russia's Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly released his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's narrow circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin's opinion states that Putin, without giving reasons, "ordered the discharge of Ivanovs from his duties as President of the Russian Bureau."
Anton Vaino, who had been a deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
The Kremlin website says (in Russian) that he was later the head of protocol and staff of the government staff.
He said to Putin about his appointment: "Thank you for your trust."
I think it is the government's most important task to support your work as head of state on draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do the smiling faces convince?
This step has made Moscow a secret wobble.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest friends for a long time and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff would resign at their own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few are convinced here - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that right now.
But the official claim - that a man who was once praised as a potential president, at once wanted to lead Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism.
In his comments to Putin, which are quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, "it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to entrust me to this very complicated post - one could almost say - of difficult post for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Bureau for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took the post in December 2011.
Before that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of five people he trusted most.
It was once assumed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia, as a third term of office would have violated the Constitution.
But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after he hit producers
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute in the set of the series in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced their termination in a joint opinion.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday before he announced his resignation.
On the set there were artistic differences and differences of opinion.
I regret the incident, "he said in a communication.
Details of how the character of Gibsons from the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to be published at a later date according to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously played in the Sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been in the series since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have spent the last 12 years in my whole heart blood," Gibson said in a communication published on Friday.
I was hoping to be there until the end, but that won't be possible now.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and, above all, the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The planned broadcast of the 12th season is scheduled for September 28.
The riddles about fish that landed in the garden in Banff
A resident of Banff requested help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandals that were spilled by a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published on Periscope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the North deck of Queensferry Crossing to the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "ceiling blower," which approach the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slabs.
The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economy Keith Brown made a visit to the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses to engineering of a truly epic measure in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fitting.
In total, almost 79% of the entire bridge deck is in its place and the last section of the deck is now getting a concrete cast for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be raised to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first closure is a significant milestone in each bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents future-oriented building and civil engineering.
After the installation of the last street deck and its connection to the North Tower deck under development, we had to close the remaining gap on the north or country side.
This was achieved by drawing the northern supply bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity.
Massively, because the Viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at a slope of about 3%.
The tolerances the team is working on were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in the Moelfre Bay: Three men are "lucky to be still alive"
Three men have "happiness to be alive" after being thrown by their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfrre RNLI rescue station hit the alarm on Friday at 13: 20 BST after a crew observed the event in Moelfrre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved on from their own power.
"We saw the boat turning around in their vicinity and introduced ourselves to the worst," said the head of the Moelfre Vince Jones rescue station.
"Fortunately, the strong winds have already driven the boat out of reach until we let it go to water," he added.
Two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat, while the third man at the age of 60 was exhausted and found hanging from a boje without a lifejacket.
They all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station.
Mr Jones said: "The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky and still alive.
The boat engine had an emergency stop, but it was disconnected from the person who was driving the boat when the boat was cut off.
Someone was watching over these men today.
Hardly hurt - man stings on his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholic perp cut the clothes of his ex-girlfriend.
When this one came into the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured by the hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
She then alerted his sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to calm her brother down.
But she couldn't get him to leave the apartment.
That's why she left the house with her partner.
On the street, they met the man's ex-life partner.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who is building Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors will be much more committed in the future.
How do you respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
The SPD proposes a "housing concept" for the next Council meeting.
But the fight is programmed.
First of all, the question is: who is to build the cheap apartments?
There is no scheme so far.
SPD Group President Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens that if you want to build on urban areas, you have to identify 20% of all apartments as social housing in the future."
However, the cheap apartments can also be built in the stock.
The big point in the city hall, however, is, according to Bratmann: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
"We want investors on such areas to build at least 10 percent, but as much as possible 20 percent of the apartments as social housing."
A new urban housing support programme, which will cost millions and still need to be financed, will provide incentives.
The problem, Bratmann said: "There is no agreement between the groups at the moment."
The CDU wants to make as few rules as possible for investors.
The left wants still hard conditions for investors.
Despite this, Bratmann said that the situation in the housing market is getting worse.
If the concept of action is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the construction management.
More staff is needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the experts.
But the program is not yet complete: the around 1260 new apartments should be built anyway.
But how can we compensate for the loss of another around 1300 low-cost apartments, whose support will end in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, according to the planning speaker Nicole Palm, it is now appropriate to buy out any outstanding ties from the city.
It would also have to be considered to get apartments back into the price line.
This is possible in the west city.
The problem could be solved at once.
Because in the West City, time limits are running out at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments.
Only: that's what the owners, the housing companies don't want.
For the number of social housing in the western city is increased dramatically again, one is removed from the objective of the so-called mix.
There should be no more concentration of social weaknesses in just a few parts of the city.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group President Holger Herlitschke said: "For a broad majority, the CDU must take part in the boat."
They have concentrated on more building sites for single-family houses.
But this does not mean that a compromise cannot be found.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth
It is fascinating to watch the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but prefer to spend their free time staring on screens, has been complained by many over the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and last to smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that outside technology and activities are not mutually exclusive.
I refer, of course, to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, play cards and other spin-offs were created).
How many phenomena of pop culture did the interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand slightly decrease at the beginning of July.
Market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go out with their smartphones and look for Pokémons that are followed by a GPS and, once they have been found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."
A generation that played the game when it was younger, joined the spell and jumped for the search of the sofa.
In the US, the game led to a significant increase in the number of steps the "average" person takes every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which tracks 35,000 users, recently informed Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people who have been following each day's 30-minute training, started from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public awareness campaigns on health that want to make people "take 30 minutes of time," "come from the sofa" and "be active every day" hit deaf ears because many public messages on health are boring and come from people who look miserable.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overrated.
Those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of having cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that is fun for them.
Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As always, there are also murderous game perverts who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could walk into a door.
What the hell?
A breakthrough has taken place.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit have been able to track our activity before, they gave us no reason to play sports as this game does.
The new one will lose its appeal and the use will decrease over time.
However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the active becoming in the real world, helping many people hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in the roof tower
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the hype.
Simone Biles is on all this immune.
Dynamic on the jump horse.
Easy on the bar.
Stunning on the floor.
On the whole line brilliant.
And now, finally, she won the Olympics.
The 19-year-old American gymnast came to the multi-battle title on Thursday and expanded the gap between himself and the rest of the world in the face of the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Her overall result of 62,198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team mate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The American Simone Biles plays on the floating bar during the single multi-camp event of women in art gymnastics at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-battle title and overall the fifth, while she strengthens her reputation to be the best of her generation or even even at all.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey ended at this moment.
This success puts her in the same league as unique athletes as Michael Phelps, who have brought her sports to new heights:
Over the last three years, Biles has won her sport, 15 world medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
She expected a final test in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.
Not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered a disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after they have won gold and silver in the single multi-camp event of women in art gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles received the first medal on Tuesday, while at the farewell ceremony of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi served as a sign of exclamation.
Although Biles insisted on never planning the future during their long way to the top, this is not really true.
Part of their ground exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the road outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a little child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym in which Boorman was trained, became a force.
She has not lost a multi-battle competition since the summer of 2013, a winning series that will last as long as Biles wishes.
Even though Mustafina was easily led by two turns, the picture was cloudy.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
She picked up again with 15,433 on the floating beam - and put one on the ground with a 15,933.
Raisman embraced her gently when they expected her final gift - a pure formality - and tears flowed on Biles gloss red, white and blue eyeliner, when the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.
The performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a deep-brew.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, who is called "Grandma" by the Americans, had a lead.
After her ground practice, she threw kisses at the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.
As far as Biles is concerned, the rapidly spreading tweet of the 19-year-old from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims shot in serial murder when listening to music in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot, who died in one of the most deadly attacks in a decade in the first serial murder of Phoenix, while they were talking in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in an driveway, said the authorities.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a hand-fire weapon while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, is to be read in the report.
The police reported that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that were owned by one of the adult victims.
The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investigators to get a closer look at whether they were connected to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two more were injured in four months' time in nine attacks, mainly in hiSpanish residential areas.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," said Howard of the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.
It is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter Maleah died on the ground.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a parked car and hear music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which was aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is assumed to be the serial killer's work.
Investigators found cartridge shells and secured a bullet from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It gets better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and of course his mother.
But like the least of his elders, Edmund Microcephalie, the result of a genetic disorder his mother Elizabeth Picciuto didn't know about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't get involved.
Which is not true at all -- of course one has agreed, "she said.
Her husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund might never know her and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest that he be institutionalized.
"My first answer was' I didn't know that people were still doing it '," Picciuto explained.
Edmund can walk with a help.
Edmund could not sit or scratch until his third year of age and he still can't speak.
But he's making progress.
He can walk with support and cycle.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the drawing language that Edmund made up for "Please sing something to me."
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto CBS News told.
But it's not a typical character language -- she says. Edmund invented some characters on his own.
Microcephalia has a variety of causes: genetic as well as Edmund, as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the cicavirus during pregnancy.
The symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the life of those infected with the Zikavirus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking what's going to happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked for the forecast for a long time, because I don't expect anyone to tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the zikavirus.
It's getting better.
You know it's gonna get better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Severe rain, flooding gives cause for rescue in Louisiana, Mississippi
Severe rains and large-scale floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call the emergency on Friday. More rain is expected all Saturday.
Many rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened with large-scale floods after extreme rains, reported the National Weather Service.
The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and that assistance to the affected communities is already on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, announced that the requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were increasing.
Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa alone had requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system is used in large parts of the south of Louisiana by Saturday.
The weather service made it clear that in this area there could be an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain.
In the south of Alabama a flood warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the area of mobile.
The Comite River near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both of which are in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
The meteorologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a current-oriented flood in Ascension Parish is a danger, as these will only slowly flow into Lake Maurepas through the affected rivers.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level on Friday at 9: 00, which was ever recorded.
Rescue teams were still feeding people from the flood in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the south-west of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were saved near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, has increased strongly overnight.
He said that another stepson who lives near him would have warned him.
"We woke up, and the water was flowing, and it was flowing in," said Hansford.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a high level of the river.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that no-one had saved all three of them in a big military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were housed by Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood had "spread rapidly," as there were still severe rain and that the authorities were considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported from midnight to Friday morning from 13.75 inches of rain.
Krautmann said that the ground was well-done since Wednesday due to the rains.
The authorities indicated that severe rain and road floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and the loss of teaching in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that one associate in Tangipahoa reported 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, both of which were now flooded.
The chief of the municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that were washed up by the flood.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency accommodation was set up to accommodate the evacuated.
"As soon as the water starts to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the city of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa, almost two dozen roads were closed due to the flood and sandbags were provided for the inhabitants to take away, hoping to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
"The last great flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said that it continued to rain on the Gulf coast.
According to his information, a handful of houses were reported to be flooded on Thursday, but no one was reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "through bullets," survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police tell me that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week for the second time that a 6-year-old child was shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents said that Brown suffered several gunshots, including in the loins, leg, arm and abdomen, but that he was conscious when he was transported to the hospital.
"He went through a lot, his little body was smashed by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the transmitter.
I just can't believe this.
The condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family informed the station that he is expected to recover.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germany.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old, who is in critical condition, reports the transmitter.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police are just investigating whether one of the injured men of the perpetrators could be found.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that a crossfire had apparently come between several gunmen.
Patron shells for storm rifles that were traced back to different storm rifles were sewn over the scene.
It seems that this was clearly a continuous fight.
On the road, on both sides of the road, there were sleeves.
There seems to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved, "said police officer Anthony Ginaldi to the Philadelphia police.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There were no arrests and the police are currently reporting the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a cross-bat when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is what I imagine under the women's Olympic team in gymnastics and for more than one reason.
First of all, since 1984, I have been in every summer Olympics and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second, this team has three gymnastics, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who were inspiring for many young girls of other skin color.
The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, who is Jewish and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team is finally reflected in the United States.
It has strengthened the black and Spanish female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one among female gymnastics was an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.
This shows strength.
At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times the world's world female Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but master gymastic routines.
On Thursday Simone became the fourth heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multi-campaign event for women.
= = References = = = = External links = =
We experience the top of this sport, but that's not what gymnastics look like throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make it to the Olympic team.
They are the "last five," because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnastics in the team, and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics are a expensive sport and that Turner is primarily in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents who are responsible for the training, establishment, travel, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnastics and families).
The majority of these gymnastics are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the gymnastics receive their entire training and this is a expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started playing.
We must allow the communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to have a more efficient and easily accessible gymnastics training.
I set up my gymnastics for 20 years.
At my events we offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people (especially black and Spanish) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics, and that's great.
It is so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thank you, you can't give her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistants want to organize further strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute about the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistants who voted in a vote rejected him.
In July, Hunt had revealed plans to force the contract and said that the NHS was in a "no-man's land" and any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients.
The first assistants will receive a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend work to improve the care at untimely times.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistants, said last night in a communication: "Assistants still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will stimulate the current labour crisis and allow all doctors to be treated in a fair manner."
In only eight weeks, which remain until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
The BMA's efforts to resolve the disputes through discussions met with the government to take part in reluctance and sometimes in deafening silence.
That's what happened to a promise Jeremy Hunt made last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt has to act now, lift the suspense and address the concerns of the assistant doctors."
If he does not do so, the assistants have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work campaigns.
The last strike at the end of April provided for a postponement of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates, as nurses and specialists were involved to provide medical coverage on the strike post chain.
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute about the changes by adopting the reformed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better week's pay for the 54,000 assistants who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of the NHS staff, called on the assistants to stop the strike.
Mortimer said: "Work-related measures do not achieve a little, but are already overburdened teams and service providers, and only cause patients, carers and their families to worry, need and interruption."
In the last two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistants and have responded positively to the concerns of the public health department and other ministries regarding the public health and whistleblogging.
Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those who return from a professional leave, most training, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was for employers, health education in England and the Ministry of Health to respect the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2 per day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 per day drug, after the authorities have recommended that more people be given this for a longer period of time.
The anticoagulation medicine ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or further heart attack.
The NICE regulatory authority of the NHS has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NICE regulatory authority of the NHS has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and stroke are caused by accumulations of fat-containing material in the arterial walls that make up lathes.
When the clot breaks down, it can cause a blood clot that clots the blood flow to the heart and causes a heart attack.
If the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the blood stream and clot the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making blood clots more unlikely.
The draft guidance of NICE, which was published today, recommends a 12-month dose of 90mg ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily dose of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
The fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and stroke in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
Information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - in particular the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years and the draft guidance does not recommend treatment beyond that period.
Culture of Political Correction makes electoral fraud flourish in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on the occasion of a government report on corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities being knowingly ignored as a devastating government report today revealed.
The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles has been attacking the police, election observers and city hall to ignore evidence of election abuse due to "the hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up restraining bands outside of electoral cabins in order to protect intimidated voters.
It recommends that voters carry an ID to prove their identity in elections.
At present, a voter only has to give his name and address.
The report proposes to apply indelible ink to a person's finger when they vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblower should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
It calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.
"This is not only against electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court decided that after a litany, the mayor-in-office of Lutrus Rahman should be relieved of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.
The court found that Rahman had "perverted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cynical way, and that he had silenced his critics with racist and Islamophobia accusations.
Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of a imitation where one person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He was particularly alarming about the fraudulent choice of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, illustrated, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including the management of ID cards to prove the identity
His report states: "As evidence has been provided that pressure has been put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, to choose in accordance with the will of the elderly, in particular communities with a Pakistani or banglithic background.
"There were concerns that... state institutions would have knowingly ignored such behaviour due to" politically correct "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the ban that political activists are processing letter-making documents to stop "electoral harvesting."
The report, which is considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration reviews to prevent the electoral list from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters for your ID before choosing.
Use non-removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
carry out systematic checks on the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
A three-year limit to applications for an automatic letter selection.
Prohibition for political activists to process full letter elections and envelopes of letter elections.
To give the police the power to set up a blockage for election stations.
A change in the law which facilitates an indictment for intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983 (National Representation Act 1983).
Photographic ban in election stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in the electoral stations (except Wales).
Intensifying training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the election cabin alone.
Sir Eric falls across the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlet's case no criminal charges were made.
"The election court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unfit for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
It has been known guilty on a number of grounds of sufficient - in accordance with the high requirements of criminal proceedings.
He also criticised the effective "cut-off control" of the city hall's election registration departments.
Sir Eric said, "The court judgment in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of the parliaments, has a proud heritage, but the worrying and hidden spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Crazy for Kates Radler-Duplicate and other famous bikers of Olympic athletes in Rio
This week, fans of the Olympic Games 2016 in Rio have gone out of control of the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proved to be an impressive double-runner of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic is by far not the only one to fight for gold-fighting Athlet that has its own famous doppelganger this summer - at least not if you can believe the social media.
In honor of the Rio Olympic Games and all the famous faces that are currently flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that have more than just a certain resemblance to Hollywood's famous.
The hunter and the wolf: team member of the US team in archery Brady Ellison, on the left, has been compared since his childhood with Leonardo DiCaprio
Apart from Kate's double on the bike track, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio.
The team member of the US team in archery Brady Ellison has caused an attack on Twitter after pictures on which he looks uncanny like the Wolf of Wall Street Star showed up.
In fact, the archer got the madness in the social media and admitted that he has been hearing that he looks like Leo since he was a kid.
"I myself do not see a great resemblance, except the facial hair," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess I'll take that as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be even more the focus this year: the striking similarity between the British wide jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her big, expressive eyes should be able to go through as a double-handedly for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
A Gang Higher: This user is of the opinion that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception Actor
Another continuing comparison was made between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medallion swimmer Yulia Efimova has more than just the sun-brewed skin and blond hair like the actress Annalynne McCord, while the American Nathan Adrian was attacked by fans to equate an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Strong women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the similarities
Theory put in space: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the US football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face form and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal winner in the gymnastics Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, wide smile, which is similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Commentator for the Olympic Games apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m Freestyle-Swim-Staffel outraged spectators of the CBC live transmission of the Olmyptic Games on Wednesday
The Canadian station CBC had to apologize after one of its commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "went off like Mief" and during the race as "a pig died."
The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was turned off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m Freestyle Swim.
MacDonald, who had been taken on board in the CBS's commentator team to give more "color," could hear you say, "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
Too excited, went off like mief, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the pool 1: 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, which allowed the Canadians to open the gap to China.
Audience throughout Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the sound and the language
Emmett Macfarlane second, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China" died like a pig "???
The idiot didn't understand they were still on the show. "
Ai Yanhan from China was described as "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby, at the final 4 x 200m free-stillswimming ball for women."
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, in which many raised him
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, # ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racist. # angled.
A short time later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC show, apologized live for MacDonald's comment and said, "We apologize for the fact that the comment on a swimming performance was broadcast."
It was an unfortunate formulation, we're sorry it happened. "
CBC at the end apologized to the people who responded to the notice on Twitter over 90 times.
The commentator, Scott Russel, had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also apologized quickly and issued a communication.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that it has been possible for them to be broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the show last night and to our followers in the social media.
To make one thing clear, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
However, they were inappropriate and an unacceptably chosen wording. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the show and tried to justify his comment by saying that it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's pool in the CBC Olympic show, he said.
"I have referred to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, no disrespect was intended and I am very sorry. "
Buyer in Primark outrages about woman who tries shameless underwear in the middle of the business
The buyers didn't know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a private car to try on underpants.
In order to make the situation worse, she was, as she looked, taking off and putting it back on the shelf.
She continued to stoop and tried four pairs of underpants in a shop at the Buverlie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
The Primark business at the Buverlie Place shopping center in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underpants before she put them back in the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she got dressed again and left the business without buying anything."
She said, "People could not believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants out of the stock, took off her own tights and pants and tried them on.
"She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky as Oskar."
"Everyone was staring when she took off the underpants, which she obviously did not like when she put them back on the shelf."
She repeated the same with three other underpants before finally deciding that she was not happy, dressed and went out again.
"She didn't seem to mind that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who might have bought the underpants she had tried."
Mrs Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "How disgusting to think that someone would take home underpants that were on another person and that were not washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs Davidson added: "As I have heard, the employees have tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after she left - which is just as good."
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman was wearing them and taking them off and they weren't washed."
One speaker from Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that happened in our Folkstone branch on Tuesday, August 9."
All the products in question were withdrawn from the sale.
How to protect yourself from arms attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a distance.
Regardless of whether you are approached from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the spike for your robber.
If you approach yourself from behind, you should turn around first, so you can see your attacker and "get out of the line," says Mizrachi.
Then hit the gun between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit him in the face with your free elbow.
Then hit him with the knee in the bar and twist, while the attacker is curling with pain, the gun from his hands. Hit him with the run in the face and move backwards while they turn the gun on him.
For attackers approaching from the front, the technology is similar - move your body out of the firing line, take the gun and twist it so the attacker can't shoot.
At the same time, put your weight on the gun and hit the attacker in the chest, then turn the gun out of his handle before they move backwards and turn the gun on him.
Sounds difficult?
Look at the video to see exactly what Mizrachi's doing.
But remember that in a robbery it is most safe to hand over your money - unless you are a Krav Maga Grand Master.
Traveler Ian Wright shakes his tongue for a travel guide in the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveller carried out a serious test of his immune system and spice flex - leaking some of the most dirty and disgusting places in Europe.
The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, took his course on a euro note, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a washbutton of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.
Before leaking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he's going to get into.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to light.
The idea of leaking the washing button of a towing toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright talked to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he leaked left more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known to test the resilience of his bowel by traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public premises at stations to toilet washers, the task definitely put his immune system under one test
In the film he said, "As a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all the possible things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."
In the film, he was definitely able to meet his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His test shot showed a luminometer number of more than 4000 units.
In comparison, the number of fresh washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after its luminometer number was over 4000 units, while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
In the film he says, "This is close to the worst thing I've smelled in a toilet."
There's nothing more graceful than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of milk products Valio.
The company is providing Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer the consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We did crazy brainstormings that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide the consumers with more information in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "Let me say it like this - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had leaked some of the things I told him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."
Of course, there were things that made it easier for Ian to lick them and others where this was rather difficult.
I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film. "
In a 2015 survey carried out by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria, in particular with the well-being of the stomach and the intestine, and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
Asocial family destroyed before delaying social housing in Saltash, Cornwall
An social family left her social housing after a delusion with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were violently removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing association found the property in an irreparable state.
The walls had flapping holes, wooden floors were torn up, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.
The family were relocated and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said that she is afraid that the apartment is no longer to be repaired.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here, and I think people don't have to live that way.
There are many things to consider, as this property is probably considered not to be such a beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is infamous and its reputation is also.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had done included street fights with baseball fighters, intimidators of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, fighting and cursing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease contract, received an order for antisocial behaviour in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old garbage was found
In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden floors were torn up
Neighbors said they saw them fight on the street and had to be called the police regularly
Cornwall Housing this week, she and her partner were violently delouted from the estate after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily take off.
The Delogation was cheered by facilitated neighbors who said their lives were made to hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
"This morning we couldn't sleep."
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Nighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the family had failed to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
On the overgrown side of the community house, garbage and old toys were thrown down
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and for their family's behaviour, as a delusion is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
This was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horribly taken into account for their neighbours.
I appreciate all the work my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as members of the community who have come to us bravely and have provided us with the information.
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that antisocial behaviour is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delusion
The workers of the house administration will now have to get away from the waste mountains that surround the house
In 2014, the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash of £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she had been guilty of the possession of a class B drug in commercial terms.
She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were out of shelter, Tanya and her partner are now expected to live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the house's rooms were covered with graffiti.
The police say that she will detour tenants who do not follow the house order
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police said that the delusion is a clear warning to the other tenants who do not comply with the house order.
"This is about those who think they can act without self-reproach and those who have been damaged by such behaviour," she said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panicked after a deep military jet of beach flying
Sunbeds in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion Air Force aircraft took an incredible crash flight
The air forces indicated that it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no safety risk.
This was the moment when scared tourists start to panic after a deep jet falls over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft almost flew in close proximity to the sun-worshippers on the beach section in Aveiro in the north of Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped up when they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines, without first seeing what was coming through the clouds on them.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by in the social media, said: "It was flying very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling down on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the plane came out of the dark and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese air forces today indicated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to identify them.
The speaker said that the jet was flying a little deeper than usual due to the poor visibility of the area fires, but the air forces insisted that safety was not at any time at all at risk.
This summer, land fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland, where four people also died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air forces today indicated that the pilot had to fly so deep due to the conditions - strong mist and fire smoke - which restricted his view
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with concerns against Seville
Seville - Barcelona FC is fighting for the first step to the first title win in the new football season on Sunday.
The Catalans are in the duel around the Spanish supercup out against Sevilla, the replay is three days later at Camp Nou.
The Doublewinner has to refrain from Neymar, who is competing with Brazil for the Olympic football tournament with the lower-ranking cupfinalist and leading Europe League champion.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
The German experienced a bending in the knee in the training, which at least for the time being the first question at Barca was resolved in favour of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing in Barcelona for two years for the status as number one.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far failed to make a clear decision and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen in most of the other applications.
Before the first mandatory game of the new season, the Spanish master has doubts about the fitness condition of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a test game by Liverpool with 0: 4.
Also at 3: 2 in the probegalopp against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. were not really able to convince.
Sevilla, in turn, has to digest the 2-3 defeat after an extension in the European supercup against Real Madrid and is seeking the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana."
Barcelona is a record winner in this competition with 11 successes so far.
Ma Long in a private league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic winner.
The 27-year-old defeated his countryman and "title defender" Zhang Jike 4: 0 on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro (12.5.4.4).
The world rankings first took the Golden Grand Slam with success at World Cup, World Tour Final Tournament and Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese made it to the final game as expected and made the title among themselves.
This made it clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would get the single title in the sign of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top of the Olympic staircase was the former SVS-NÖ Legionaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, between the sentences and time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had moved back to the gallery and left their props alone in the fair competition.
"I've played the matches to this point for my country."
"I play for myself in the final," Zhang had said in a follow-up manner.
After the game, gold and silver medals won the Chinese flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
After that, he set the speed on the plate and left Zhang only 13 points.
Because of the superiority of Ma, the expected match did not develop.
However, there were still enough breathtaking ball changes to be seen.
Mizutani won the game for bronze against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4: 1.
In his quarter-final against German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, the white-Russian had suffered a rib injury, then was in medical treatment, and had to "finally" settle with sheet.
The Sweden Jan-Ove Waldner (38 / 2004) and Jörgen Persson (42 / 2008) had also become in similar high table tennis age Olympia-Fourth.
Donald Trump honors "huge problems" in the election campaign
The leadership of the US Republicans is plagued by massive concerns to lose their majority in traditional conservative states.
President Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses of his election campaign in the so-called Republican high castle of Utah.
A rare moment when the usually large-scale and self-confident multimillionaire expressed some concern as correspondents reported.
After he has thrown 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, the doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are now growing.
"We have huge problems in Utah," said Trump in front of evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
He was responsible for the false reports of his candidacy, and he rerecorded his well-known media scams.
Republican high castles wobble
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a June survey by SurviyUSA, Trump and his competitor of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were in the same position.
Other institutions see Trump ahead, but not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered to be at risk.
In an interview of the CNBC station, Trump answered the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clintons again: "Just as I have done so far."
And then, after that, this will either be "successful, or I will make a very nice, long holiday."
He does nothing but "tell the truth."
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that is all right, Trump said.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump party is supposed to have threatened to remove funds to support its campaign if it is not able to present better survey values.
Instead, the candidates of the Republicans for the Congress were to be strengthened.
Olympia: Threatest fraud in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenia's athletes are threatened by the second Doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games.
After an attempt at fraud at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee announced that it would immediately set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had announced that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, had given an urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to the team management of Kenya by the Doping controllers.
The International Federation of IAF has asked the IAC for information on the case to encourage its own investigations, an IAF spokesperson informed.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IOC, the IAF will carry out an assessment," said an IAF declaration.
"He (Anzrah) went to the Doping Control Station and spent his time as Ferguson Rotich, gave the sample and signed it," said Kenia's Chief of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who was on the list for the World Anti-Doping Agency's training controls.
Ferguson Rotich had become over 800 metres in Beijing's fourth World Cup in 2015.
Four days earlier, the Kenyan Athletics Head of Delegation Michael Rotich had been removed from the Rio Games.
He said he had informed athletes of the upcoming doping tests against money payments from his country.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return to Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC for a long time after numerous doping offences.
The announcement of the more than 2000 Doping target controls before the Rio Games by the IOC has been unusually pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are being targeted.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-Doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics.
As a result, the WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose doping control is in line with the rules of the WADA.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country's light athletes won most of the medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
A number of television reports from the ARD have repeatedly raised allegations that in Kenya doping funds are easily accessible and that there is a significant mentality of sport fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound last asked for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in Russian athletics.
It has been shown that this sport has been widely covered and systematically doped.

Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic lover, similar to Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical takes Salzburg: the "West Side Story," Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classical and filled himself with the role of Mary a youth dream.
In the orchestra's grave the Simón Bolívar orchestra under the direction of the Venetian conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he warns.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody.
It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I'd say we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this production Bartoli plays an older Mary.
She remembers her love with Tony with Wehmut while the younger Mary plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First of all, because she's extraordinary in music!
And then there's Mary's personality.
She says it in her song, "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and white and bright."
So it is smart, of course also naive, and very passionate.
"She is very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honor for us to work with her.
She's a very generous person.
And Bartoli gives back the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Distortion is a necessity for him.
You see it in every one of his movements, in his eyes, it's his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a joyful approach to life, that is very important at all!
For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly up-to-date: "This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the puertorans went to New York, and the New York people didn't want them.
They are the same issues, and they are as meaningful today as they were at the time.
59 years later, the play is still relevant.
London schoolgirl, who joined the IS, was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the IS, was reported to have died in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family learned about her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air attack in Raqqa, the group's bulwark in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she planned to leave the country of war and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good thing is in it - as a warning and warning to others, that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other school girls from the east of London arrived on a plane towards Turkey and then on a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultan's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will remain a candidate for the Supreme Court in the event of a win at Garland.
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge at the Supreme Court of Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to select Garland "with a certain degree of certainty."
A speaker from Reid later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton if she would nominate Garland and speculate.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not cause trouble with a new candidate.
Garland is the top judge of the U.S. Appellation Court for the District of Columbia.
Raid said that Republicans blocked the Garland nomination, were Lakaien and helper of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was not suitable for the presidential office.
Treats wants naked calendar for "women and men"
The Treats magazine works with photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970's Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Calendar for 2017.
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine was different from old school playboys because "Playboy is for men."
I'm doing this for women.
He seems to think that the calendar is doing the same.
"We must return to the presentation of timeless and classic nudity, in which both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body," said Shaw in a press release on the publication of the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or in person with open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass escape
"He who does not adapt and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases," says the Chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun.
In the short term, the Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of people to flee from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even be "a few hundred thousand," Ali Toprak believes.
Because of the hard action of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I am counting on tens of thousands, in the medium term, with some hundreds of thousands of people seeking protection from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the "world" leader Ali Toprak of the "world" of Friday.
Because the government has already covered Kurdish strongholds months ago with penalties, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey are on the run.
After the failed coup, secular and opposition ethnic Turks would be added.
Many will want to start over in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be that a state that itself receives refugees produces refugees in its own country," said Toprak.
The chief of the association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in alevite cities.
In this way, Erdogan wanted to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last great minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or expelled in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The head of the association called for the Federal Government to "position itself as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters."
A "witch hunt" against Erdogan critics is also taking place in Germany.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition people.
The fire marking as a Gülen-trailer destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"He who does not adapt and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases, by the way also the Kemalists and Seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-near-foundation dialogue and education, the "world."
As the newspaper reports by reference to the figures of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks already presented before the coup the largest group of asylum-seekers recognised for political persecution in Germany.
On June 30, these were 11.386 people, and thus almost 29 percent of all those who were eligible for asylum (39.625).
This survey does not include those fleeing from war, poverty or hopelessness.
The right to asylum under the Basic Law is exclusively political, that is, from the state side, individual persecution.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals do not get anything from the summer election campaign - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they have understood.
In 2021 the country election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
For it is not more stupid than before: summer holidays, heat and country election - that bites itself.
The locals, who are to be convinced by the election fighters, are on holiday.
Most of the tourists who are in the country, on the road to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the country day.
There are also practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, blow up balloons, distribute flyers and end up counting voices, are only tiring up.
By 4 September 2016, the election and last holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again have a campaign just past the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.
And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.
It is exciting to see how much newcomer afd cuts off and what is left in the end of the coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, is making an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one looks out of his big posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and talks with the people a little, just as he did his legendary, progeny predecessor Harald Ringstorff.
Otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the Flooding of the AfD.
Your refugee policy, your "we can do this" has accelerated the rise of the legal lists, which is likely to cost him the beautiful office now.
The CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already seen what it is like to do in the right place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale announcements; Merkel is in the north-east.
But the target group was wrong, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony than Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority of other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it's not too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the north-east CDU largely renders the usual election stations at market places and in front of shopping centres with parasols and balloons.
This, according to Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role."
The Union has also noticed that in the country you are burning the basis away, that it must make a great effort to find a link to people again.
She is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly available in the wide areas of the country.
However, the council of the CDU election fighter Kokert to his fellow leaders is also self-revealing: "They must go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign.
In surveys, the Social Democrats were last behind CDU (25) with 22 percent and just before the AFR (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had clearly won 35.6% before the CDU (22).
The Greens, the small party with seven percent in the polls, are expected to make the leap into the country day.
They make a modern virtue out of the holiday need and largely put their campaign on the Internet.
"Online election campaign," it is called the state president Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green electoral fighters go on a search for local voters among the vacations.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is just curvature with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg-Western lakes and it is also beautiful.
Her impression: "Electoral leave in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."
B27-Rehabilitation: Restaurants suffer from blockage
At the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about.
For those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5.30 in the morning and only ends at 8: 00, there is all-and-all praise.
"They've done a lot of work," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet gas station.
This is a superteam.
There is no delay.
The site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week, and everything should be ready by the end of October.
It is also commended that those responsible for the construction work are to be found, for example when it comes to the setting up of services.
Since the construction site went south on Monday and the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was also lifted and the connection to Rottenburg is again in place, the traffic situation within the village has relaxed.
The citizens can now move from the B-27 from the B-27 to the two-side.
There seems to be a decline in the traffic through the place.
"There were some significant complaints," says Deputy Chief Executive Officer Florian King, responsible for the transport management of the rehabilitation.
The residents of Bachzetzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many of them were looking for the way to go and trusted their Navi rather than the signs.
Which led to a number of trucks falling into residential areas.
As the speed limits were not met, the municipality requested the measuring vehicle from Mössingen more strongly.
"There were significant overruns," says King, who once taught himself about the situation on the ground.
Two to three a minute have been flattened.
The fastest one was on the road with 77 hour-kilometres in the speed 30 zone.
Since the construction site was moved on, however, it had become quieter.
For the business people at the B 27 it is only a little comfort that the road is now open for customers from Rottenburg.
Business people don't like to look in the cards.
But the fact that the B-27 rehabilitated them has led to a loss of sales, makes everyone who is asked to look through.
However, some are more affected and some are less affected.
Those who have less to do with the "end customer," that is to say, produced for other companies, have little consequences for them.
At the Maier car house Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "maximum slight decrease," but also acknowledges that, of course, "the running skills are missing."
The local ones are the most arched along the street.
J. Albert Gohner, owner of the Steakhouse, former crown, finds clear words.
This is already a threat to existence.
Not only him, but all the restaurants have "hit it hard."
The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.
We must be happy about every euro.
The loss of sales is estimated at "well over 50 percent."
The road renovation had "thrown back its operation by two years."
He had to release half his employees.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half of them were released, politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, government President Jörg Schmidt replied to a question by Gohner, whether there could be a financial compensation, indicating that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the benefits of the situation in the B-27. Now she must also bear the disadvantages of the rehabilitation.
Gohner knows about other countries where such a thing was handled more generously.
With all the complaints Gohner is sure that his restaurant will continue.
After all, the family business has been located here since 1715, he refers to the long history.
He can understand that other regular guests are now less often looking by because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can't drive here, it's beautiful somewhere else.
That his family clientele will come back after the end of the renovation work, Gohner has no doubt about that.
Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Gohner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on his customers to be the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction work, that's brutal.
In the name of the fight against terrorism, laws are constantly being breached.
After the recent attacks, Minister de Maizière now presents a thick security package.
But what does a fatigue status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciliation.
All his proposals were "politically reasonable" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package.
They don't overdo anyone.
Other further issues would first be discussed within the parties.
I'm also involved in this.
As Minister of the Interior, however, he was concerned with results and with a "achievable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière had a little time passed before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But they are now all the more important.
Some are already known, announced, leaked: a new security authority is not new to deal with the crack of encrypted communication.
Nor is it the fact that Germany has to implement several EU rules on passenger data and arms law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizière is launching a second start for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to punish the campaign of sympathy for terrorist groups and to cut off the German passport by jihadists with double citizenship.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man admits.
He still considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that the coalition partner does not have any chance of.
A few new ideas are also presented by de Maizière.
They have it in themselves in part: he is planning rapid procedures for deportation and more possibilities for the detention of people before deportation.
Refugees who are specifically taken to the country should first have their smartphones checked and social media accounts disclosed for a security review.
In the case of defamation for refused asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to conceal their identity.
Some of this is politically and legally sensitive.
Some also seem undone and leave questions open.
And on some points - in the case of the unequal treatment of the patient, for example - the question arises: what does this have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière that it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.
But it cannot be denied that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about security in view of the high number of refugees.
And things that were deeply occupied by people could not be excluded even in election times.
Internal security has become a major focus.
Only the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are election fights on.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the subject of internal security.
In the past few days, there has been a high level of progress between the two parties.
First a gratifying dispute about the equipment of the federal police, then a security policy collection of some Union Interior Ministers, in which the department heads also call for a Burka ban and a return from double citizenship.
De Maizière also needs to make a friendly sound here.
He doesn't think he's going to take a turn from the double pass.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
It would not make sense to reopen it.
And in a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether its own package is constitutional on all corners and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner has yet to show itself.
There's a lot in it that could cause a fight.
But the SPD is also currently trying to take advantage of the issue of internal security.
The party's chief Sigmar Gabriel signs a careful willingness to talk and says, "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
Volkswagen is still getting away with it.
Despite diesel scandals, the world's output figures are rising.
But not all markets are around.
There's a word in the call-back.
Volkswagen starts with the deliveries of transporters to the second half of the year.
Europe's largest car manufacturer, despite the diesel industry, can continue to show a plus in the course of the year, thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.
But in July, the VW core brand weakened, especially in Western Europe, and thus again charged the total sale, as reported by the company listed in the Dax.
The VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles worldwide in July with 449100 cars than in the previous month.
In Western Europe alone, the second most important market after China, sales were 14 percent lower than the previous year.
In the home market Germany, the deliveries were almost a sixth.
Brand sales director Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker figures from July, especially on two days of sale less in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets, there has been a "change in economic conditions" in order to reduce sales.
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote had also been burdened to leave the EU, a speaker explained.
In the United States, where the exhaust gas market first escalated, there is also a minus on the line.
The Chinese market is a great support for VW.
In total, the mainly affected house brand of the Lower Saxony is already further sparsely due to the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only one delivery reduction of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is available.
Group Sales Director Fred Kappler was able to continue to present a sales portfolio from January to July.
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered in this period, with a total of 5,904 million in the world.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust tests with a software.
In Germany alone, VW calls for about 2.5 million cars to be converted to the workshops.
In the course of the remodeling, VW confirmed that the remodeling of the cars has no negative effects.
There was no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after the vehicle was reinstalled.
The car manufacturer will issue a "guarantee-like" certificate to the customer after the change, but does not speak of a "guarantee," as was said in business circles on Friday.
The reason for this was legal finalities.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now granted its German customers a guarantee for redesigned diesel models.
This would have been confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting.
"VW has to comply fully with the requirements of my Commission of Inquiry and the KBA."
"Derogations from this are not accepted," said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrendt (CSU), according to the Ministry.
VW has taken the guarantee that fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power will not deteriorate after the conversion and that all type-approval-relevant vehicle values will remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee" as it was said in business circles.
With the wide term "guarantee," Volkswagen sees the possibility that, for example, half a year after the upgrade, customers can come into a workshop with a motor damage - and this could lead back to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important in the customer interest to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust channel from being unsafe in terms of possible guarantee arrangements, as it was said.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantee."
Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee requires rich savers in the future to have criminal interest - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank Chief Josef Paul said on Thursday, "It's only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on giro- or daily money accounts."
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it: Normal savers should "not be afraid to pay for their large-scale criminal interest."
If banks store overnight money at the European Central Bank (ECB), they will have to pay their 0.4% penalty rate.
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund will recover this fee from private and company customers for deposits of over 100,000 euros on giro- or daily money accounts from September.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year," Paul said.
He has been protecting 40 million euros for some time, which could be dropped from one day to another and which he cannot use.
"They're on my central bank account and they cost 0.4 percent," said the bank chief.
"I can't lay down 4000 euros for every million."
He has now passed on the costs in accordance with the polluter pays principle.
Just leaving the cash in the vault of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've already experienced four robberies, I don't want the fifth!," said the bank board.
Most customers would have understood and changed to other forms of investment.
Only a few of them migrated to other banks.
The cooperative association of Bavaria said: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy course causes significant costs for all banks."
It is not possible to carry them on their own for the long term.
Some German banks have therefore increased their charges for account management, credit cards or transfers.
With penalty interest rates for deposits from three million euros, the Thuringia People's and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014.
Michael Kemmer, head of the banking association, said: "We do not expect private customers to pay comprehensive deposits charges, for which the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong."
A banker said that there was "a client on the Lake Tegernsee, which is slightly more well equipped with the property."
"This can be a problem for a small bank," if it is to keep money free of charge.
The Gmund Cooperative Bank, founded in 1911, has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
The region is home to well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs.
The cooperative association of Bavaria "is not currently known to any other banks that calculate a replacement for deposits of private customers," said Speaker Ernst.
The President of the Federal Association of German Volksbanken and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, had explained at the end of June: "The threshold of going into the negative vis-à-vis the private customer is very, very high."
The competition was hard, and it threatens the emigration of investors to competition.
The customers in Germany will not let this fall in width.
Destination Plates: who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love records.
Before you rush to the comment part to oversee it under the pseudonym of non-allUnenamen men's middle age with harsh insults, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-spoken recovery of records is not a boom in millennia that wants to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but is due to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought a record are expected to be between 45 and 58.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not a hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I'm running in the middle of a busy road in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit and studying wild before I stop, holding my hands and saying something decisive like, "So let's take a closer look at it."
So, let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Sohos is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent sellers were established - there is still a handful of fantastic record shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part where I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by watching.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I follow from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data number: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around 20) is one day because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress out the walls of his living room.
The reason he has such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and again buy items he sold when he was young and broke.
"Many things I buy are from the late '60s, early' 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things that I was probably a little young to buy them to me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
This is my truck.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets are on the YouGov profile.
He has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media hpe, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old records again.
From the talks I've been holding, people have usually been getting rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.
This would explain the boom to the supporters of the record reform of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates?
It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record business offers a soothing community of like-minded.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took the lead on the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, from objects that raise happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of an empty or the possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," Wez says.
That's what I do as a collector, and I think a lot of people do.
It's a simple way to get involved in the mind.
"We are like their social workers!" a staff member flashes from a record pile.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have a record player.
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned, while I'm blowing through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at the Sounds of the Universe (data: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.
"Someone just came in here recently and said," I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a radio head record so I can put it on the shelf, "he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it is definitely happening.
More product-difficult, less musical.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older people, who come in slowly.
Fopp, who has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a colorful audience when I go in.
There are couples around 70, tourists taking photos, teenagers and middle-aged women.
Even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-covered pop, instead of experimental jazz, is drifting from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.
None of them look very lonely, but nagging mental trauma is hard to see when you're standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been in business for a few minutes and is looking at the variety of the plates for sale.
She's more of a showcase than a big buy-in.
It doesn't make much, so collecting plates is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It is easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of records is... "it drives off with a in love sigh.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I seem to model the jeans hotpans, I'm watching a group of young teenage pests who group around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a stairwell, a wall full of plates by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
No one looks at them - maybe because they're just purely decorative, some so far up that it's impossible to touch them.
It's just "record art."
But given that every attraction for these objects means more money for the industry and that some customers could send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury items like records.
Although my research has shown that the results of YouGov are correct, at least in record stores in Soho, they do not take into account the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday morning bumming through Berwick Street's record shops and the leaves through records, while avoiding the staring look of an uncanny, 30-year-old wrong moderator who doesn't charge over the shoulders of middle-aged men.
The Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video report
More scientifically, the Greenland shark has the longest life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who is investigating sharks, says that the record was with a female who is expected to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French court rejects offer on the demolition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer from the authorities in Calais to take down dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
In a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the State should be able to take down 72 provisional transactions in which persons within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
The Calais Prefecture argued that these places should be demolished because they would be a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a fire and health risk.
Humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also said that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people who are doing the 72 provisional business, but admitted that the concerns of the Prefecture of Calais were "absolutely understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that the food business, cafés and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the derelict was the Jungle Book Kids' Café des Lagers, which is run for free and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to protect the Kids' Café.
A letter to the Guardian said that "the closure would be a disaster for these children, of which the last eight years are old."
The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrts estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had increased to over 9,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep increase in newcomers during the summer.
Despite Olympia disappointment: Martin remains fighting
In spite of his disappointing performance in the Olympic era, Radpro Tony Martin does not want to be subdued.
"I keep an eye on the World Cup, remain confident and continue to fight," wrote the 31-year-old on Thursday before he left Rio de Janeiro on Facebook.
He does not have an explanation for his miserable twelfth place at the sugar house.
"To be honest, it's hard for me to comment on yesterday's time drive," Martin said.
He had to analyse in peace what reasons would have led to the debacle.
Martin wanted to fight for the title at the World Cup in Qatar in October.
"I'll look at everything we've changed in the last few years."
"This also includes my position," wrote the three-time World Champion, who lost on Wednesday to the 54.5 km more than three minutes on Olympic victory Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
Olympia: Tennis Profi Siegemund misses half-finals
The victory of Laura Siegemund ended in the quarter final of Rio: The world rankings 32 from Metzingen missed by a 1: 6, 1: 6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico / WTA-No.

Siegenund, which was plagued by back problems, was only able to make their impact once and was powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, there was still a chance of a jump in the forward round of the event, with the hope of a meeting of the Angelique Kerber (Kiel / No. 2).
The Australian Open winner met the British Johanna Konta (no. 10).
The last German tennis pro was Tommy Haas in 2000 to get a medal (silver) in Sydney.
Two German DTB starters in the quarter-finals of summer games had last been in 1992.
Never before was a German duo in an Olympic single semi-final.
Group increases for live video video transmission when start-up
Watching other people play video games is a huge thrill - Microsoft also wants to benefit from it.
The technology group is buying the start-up beam that specializes in this hobby.
How much money is going on for the acquisition, Microsoft did not notify on Thursday.
Beam only started with his offer in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but you can also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions to the players and face enemies as well as provide equipment.
The Spieleriese Activision Blizzard is launching a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sport.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook is to help.
The advertising industry is already listening.
The start-up staff, which has been based in Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, are moving to the Microsoft headquarters in the California Redmond, as Beam co-founder and head of the company Matt Salmeendi reported.
As a result, the acquisition should not change anything for the customers.
According to Microsoft, Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market for live streaming of video games is currently growing rapidly.

Here comes the Enhancement Trailer
Germany's racers have to adapt to the next generation of speed meters: in various federal states, including in Hesse and Brandenburg, new lightning devices are being tested, which are intended to transfer Tempossinder particularly effectively.
The futuristic-acting Enforce Trailer of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident priorities where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, there is often no necessary infrastructure at motorway construction sites or to be rehabilitated bridges with temporary temporary temporary policies to ensure that the speed limit is met with a stationary flash.
However, a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or costly.
The Enhancement Trailer is autark: its battery holds five days in continuous measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
In addition, laser measurement can be used to control all vehicles simultaneously over several tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as travel bans after time, driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In a high-speed condition, the trailer can be moved according to the manufacturer with any car with a trailer coupling.
So that it is not simply stolen, it is reduced in the measuring operation, so that the wheels disappear in the armored and by the way also bulkproof outer shell.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is intended to protect the lightning from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested by Vitronic in various federal countries and is now also used.
Foreign authorities also flashes with the new technology: Recently France has ordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
Great Britain gets silver in the 7-er rugby after Fiji gets Masterclass Gold
The impressive performance of Britain at the 7th Rugby came in the final on Thursday evening to an abrupt stop at the last hurdle in the form of the figs when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-stepping, rearward, line running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was soaked by the not too bad consolation price of the silver medal - the fourth of Great Britain on that day - and they could be very proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the final.
But, regardless of that, Fiji would have hit a 15-man team in the best form in this form.
It could be a consolation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a British will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's chief coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Seven.
They only lost one here.
This sleep will hurt, but progress is amazing.
Fiji began wonderfully and had the attacks of GBs burst out of fun.
It felt like running on moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. The World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau was in the corner.
With four more minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he turned around.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
A high-quality tackle by Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa from reaching a third gate, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua left a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the reboot and there was still over a minute of playing time... in the first half.
Vatho Ravouvou preached through further weak tackling of the GB team and stormed to the line to make a gate.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
That's the way it is.
GB made fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the fijian gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the first half-time conditions, until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had long been in favour of the South Innulans, whose fans were singing, swinging flags and dancing on the stand.
It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fiji.
Mata Viliame set the i-pat with another attempt in the last seconds.
The fiff sounded, the fijis embraced themselves, and GB was smashing in the lawn.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and the UK pushed South Africa out of the race in a short half-final match - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Asian team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer to the rudder
There will be no more emotinal gold than those games, and that means something.
From the first rowing stroke to the last, 220 hard hives that enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though there were only the two who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of the coach Robin Williams was present when they went to the second Olympiagold in a row in two without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sport who laid such a scale.
Her dominance was absolute, at least her 39th undefeated commitment, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athlete who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumph to geese.
Behind every gold in the rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes up the difference and it was no one more helpful than the coach who did not know if he would survive this day at all than he was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago.
Like he said, there was a risk.
I had bladder cancer, which is operable, and they did.
If you don't, he'll spread everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the view a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky that he could start his treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right term in such circumstances at all.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
The rowing itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.
In the immediate ability of victory, her first thoughts of Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking about it a little more than usual, were trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. That may be something extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much that means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so a massive thank you to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have been a better person to train or wanted a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm that their opponents couldn't keep up with.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to open up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very trapped right now.
Helen called "Stay in trial, stay in trial."
It's really important not to get caught up.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn't want to do anything great.
We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take a time-out for a year before making decisions about their future.
Glover has to be at a wedding next week, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backwill.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say that was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic winner.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
That feels so much better, "she said.
31 years of exemplary clarity
The managing director of the "Vijensteingruppe," Ruppert Göller, is retiring.
The association is considered to be "a good example of Bavaria."
A small French drinking water supply association as an example for the large water producers.
Some time ago it was called in the original tone in a contribution of the Bavarian Rundfunk.
A little later, the Water Forum of the Government of Unterfranken appreciated the purpose association.
The work of the Vijensteingruppe was considered "to be an exemplary one."
All this is behind Rupert Göller, who worked for 31 years in the target group, including 28 years as managing director.
He was then retired at the age of 65.
The drinking water supply association of the Vißsteingruppe, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubic meters of water every year and provides 32 places and weiler with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and Baunach are members of the municipality.
For other cities and municipalities there are water supply contracts.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed a waterguard in 1985 and was appointed as the managing director of the special purpose company in 1988.
"Its tasks have been very varied and range from water management and maintenance work to office and organisation activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations at weekends," said the president.
It called the start-up and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the rehabilitation of the high-capacity containers (1999), the new acquisition of a central computer control (2004) and the subdivisions of water lines.
There has been no standstill and there have been repeated innovations, because water covered life and drinking water was the most important food.
In her Laudatio she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and correct service for 31 years.
He has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water-intended association and he has lived the water-intended association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Vijensteingruppe for nitrates steering in front of the water forum of the district of Unterfranken.
He has received a great deal of appreciation and praise for this.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best water guard, and he was a faithful boy.
Together, we were an unbeatable team.
From his point of view, he described the construction of the well and the restructuring of the purpose association.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the pipe break at the high tank at Kirchlauter on a January 3.
Here at minus 17 degrees will have to work all night, so that the villages could be supplied with water.
The supply of Neubrunn was also maintained only once, because the high tank of Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the drinking water network was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who was the successor of Rupert Göller.
The soprano Anna Netrebko is openly dealing with the autism of her son Tiago - and is addressing other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the disease was recognized by her son, she believed she had to die.
But the now eight-year-old Tiago had come well ahead and now learn privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example, if I ask him something that is two years ago when I sang to the Milan Scala, he doesn't remember anything," said Netrebko.
But he's the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection to the Bassbariton Erwin Schrout.
She is now married to the Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship stat in Bargteheide - man shoots at a life partner
A 35-year-old man shot his partner on Friday around 10.45 in a family house in Bargteheide (Stormarn County) and killed her.
"The man himself called us and said he shot his partner," said a police speaker.
The culprit was on the run, and he was called to the public.
Meanwhile nationwide, because Sven S. could be on the road by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, brown-burned and has a bald.
Meanwhile, the police have published a photo of him.
It's a few years old, though.
In the meantime, the man is wearing a bald one.
The man should not be referred to directly.
He could still carry the gun with him, says the police.
If you see Sven S., call the 110.
The police are talking about a "relationship state."
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The police responsible in Lübeck did not want to provide information on the outcome or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, but it confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It's a killing crime."
"That's all we're saying right now," said a police speaker in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a Special Operations Command (SEK) was at the crime scene.
Steel - light view for the German steel industry
The crisis-driven and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared by additional costs in millions of dollars.
The financial burden that the industry was facing from the eco-electricity sector is off the table.
It remains in the case of the exemption from the renewable energy levy on the stock installations for the so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).
"I am really glad that after two years of negotiations we were finally able to achieve this."
The European Commission had therefore first planned to ask the steel producers using the gas from the blast furnace for the production of electricity for their own consumption to pay for it.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry was at risk of additional costs of between EUR 120 and 240 million per year.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there was now a basic agreement with the EU Commission after discussions with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works will an EEC levy of 20% be charged.
But this is not the case in the steel industry either.
The IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on the production of own electricity.
The status quo of the existing scheme is thus largely defined.
Gabriel's successful efforts for the steel industry were particularly important.
"With regard to our 'steel is future' campaign, this is a first step."
"More must follow."
"The reform of the Emission Rights Trading also requires a balance between climate and employment objectives," said IG Metaler-Chef Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and significant price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
Last year, the situation continued to deteriorate when China's world's largest producer country threw massive steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.
European producers are proposing price dumping to Chinese steel companies.
In the course of this spring, the situation has been somewhat relaxed.
On the one hand, imposed import duties on imports of steel have an effect, and on the other, the economic prospects in China have been lightened.
It is not clear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained careful on Thursday.
Last but not least, prices would have stagnated again.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works.
At the end of 2015, around 86000 people were employed in the German steel industry.
In July, the German steel producers remain careful despite rising prices and increasing orders.
They produced about six percent less crude steel at 3.4 million tonnes than in the previous month, as the Economic Association reported on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced went back the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent below the previous year's value.
In the coming months, the Association expects an increase in output thanks to an improved order situation.
community, mind, health: singing is good for seniors
The singing has been accompanied by Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teaching school she recorded music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotional and physical," she describes.
After a sample she feels balanced, cheerful and more alive, she says.
By the way, she does something good for her health and her mind.
Because singing is a great hobby for senior people from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded the joy of music, describes Hackler.
Through regular cooperation, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures in old age dissolve, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To meet and organize, to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."
Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, Hackler says.
For in doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
Those who demand their lungs regularly do not get out of the puste so quickly even in everyday life.
Even if it is about getting the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.
For older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Community of the Senior Organisations.
In the older generations, singing together had a much higher importance, it was part of everyday life, both in school and leisure, she explained.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people raises many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, even demeanged people remember long-standing events.
In singing, the head is also asked for a special performance, explains Lenz.
At the same time, to focus on your own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice this way not only to focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition of the singing in the choir, Hackler says.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The self-esteem also grows by singing in the choir.
To show myself: If I practice for something for a long time, I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.
So there are good reasons to start singing, so there's enough.
Whoever wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises.
You don't sing alone - at 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes wrong?
In search of the right offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.
If someone from the family is singing in a senior choir, you can just join in.
Many cities also offer overview of the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can turn directly to the church or the church leader.
Many senior choruses are also found on the Internet.
Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help in the Internet research.
If you want to sing, you should definitely join a choir, Hackler advises.
Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to every age.
Cats react more sensitive than hangover to the cry of the young animals
Biologists in Hannover have examined the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
For their surprise, the miows did not leave the males cold - but they were always the same as the females.
Female cats can see the degree of irritation of cat babies on the mew of the little ones.
They respond ten percent faster to the sounds of kittens who are in great need, as scientists from the Veterinary and Medical University of Hannover (MHH) have found out.
Kater also respond to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
"It appears that the acoustic differences between the miows of less and highly agitated young animals are either not perceptible or not relevant to the males," said Biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study, which was published this Friday in the "BMC Evolutionary Biology" magazine.
In a previous investigation, the research team had already found that the duration and tone of the kitten scream was different from the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight kittens from the animal husbandry of the MHH were observed.
They were first played by little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screaming of more aroused kittens, which were additionally raised.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample.
"All the females, even those who had not yet had their own offspring, reacted differently to the screams," said Konerding.
They turned faster to the speaker when this call was played by the most agitated kitten.
This ability may be congenital or develop with gender maturity.
"A surprise was that the males have reacted at all," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men to baby sounds in humans several times.
Some studies also showed that women were more sensitive to infants, whether they were mothers or not, reported the biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski takes "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup attempt, Turkey is again playing an important football game.
Before the duel of the archrivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is announced.
Even when the state of emergency was imposed after the relaunch attempt in July, the government claimed that the daily life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
This does not apply, however, to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is responsible for the coup attempt.
There is no stop to the football.
The prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükür.
As a result, it is accused of being a member of a terrorist group in the now American state.
Sukür is to be a supporter of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is held responsible by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the first condition of 90 days is still valid until October, it has no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The night "democracy guards" in public places throughout the country have declared Erdogan finished on Wednesday.
The sport - like the whole country - is divided into followers and opponents of Erdogan.
In particular, fans of the Besictas workers' club are not traditionally one of the president's friends.
But what unites the great Turkish people in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coup.
Even the fans agree - whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
In the case of the "Gala" pokal winner, Lukas Podolski will be the first to return.
In the last season, Cologne demonstrated its sporting value: with 17 goals and nine performances in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as a top scorer of his club.
In the final game against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1-0 victory.
The newspaper "Fanatics" cheered him: "He was the best in the place."
He has completed the season in an excellent way and secured his team's Cup.
Thanks to "Poldi" the disappointing season for the record master found a reconciling conclusion.
After the pre-round K.o in the Champions League, the "lions" also left early in the Europe League.
In the South Lig, it was only six.
The season was not good.
The Cup was the only way to win something.
"We did that, and that's the most important thing," said Podolski.
The year was better for Master Besiktas.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who, with 26 seasons of success as a Süper-Lig-Torschützenkönig, laid the basis for the 14th title.
This is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
The Gomez, which was signed at the AC Florence and only paid to Besiktas, had announced after the coup attempt not to return because of the political situation in the country after his EM holiday.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," said the magazine "Kicker" club chief Fikret Orman.
However, the stormer would have to be willing to give up about one third of his annual salary of 7.5 million euros, and Orman made it clear that "we cannot pay his salary at Florence."
Despite Doping: These athletes still have medals at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already closed twice for Doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanova is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other led athletics sinners can only laugh at it - they fight for medals in Rio.
The subject of doping continues to determine the headlines at the Rio Olympic Games.
The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who, after a doping-block, had complained of her starright just before the games, was mercilessly plucked out at her start (100 meters of chest).
There was a skirrile scene: with a smile she was still stumbled into the hall and had provocated with her appearance.
When it was established that she was not going to get gold, the audience broke into a joyful storm.
However, there are many other athletes who are going to start the Olympic Games in Rio, despite the Doping past.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-season / USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He was closed twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his spell, the 2004 Olympic winner and former world champion is even faster than before, he is over 100 m in 9.80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the largest challenge of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100 m-season / Jamaica): The two-time Olympic winner and seven-time world champion had to sit down a six-month lock in 2010 after she was shown to take the pain drug Oxycodon.
She had a strong tooth pain after an operation, defending the 29-year-old.
Sandra Perkovic (Diskus / Croatia): In 2011, the 2012 Olympic winner, the 2013 World Champion and the 2010 European Champion were tested positively for the forbidden stimulant methyl hexanamine.
Perkovic denied the knowledge and was closed for six months.
The four largest throw this year go to the account of the great gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-season / USA): The Beijing Olympic winner and two-time world champion over 400 m, had been tested positively in 2010 and was closed for 21 months.
A means of penis enlargement had been responsible, Merritt claimed.
This year, the 30-year-old is the fastest man in the world.
Ivan Tichon (Hammerschrift, Belarus): It is unlikely that so many medals were subsequently recognized by one athlete.
Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone doping.
The 40-year-old was also forced to give out Olympic silver in 2004 because of steroid dopings and the EM title in 2006 because of testosterone abuse.
He was awarded the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a judgment of the International Sports Court (CAS).

Liu Hong (20 km of going, China): The world record and gold favorite was only tested positively in May, but is still allowed to start in Rio.
The 29-year-old world-class woman found evidence of the use of a forbidden food supplement, the ban of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA was mild and expired on July 13.
Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Several dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the spokesman of the Foreign Ministry, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.
She had cut wounds and had been treated in the hospital, but had already been able to leave.
She was planning her home trip for the beginning of September.
Whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket, as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens, is still unclear.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities in this respect, says Schnöll.
In the approximately 200 km south of the capital of Bangkok, Hua Hin had first exploded two bombs in a quarter of a walk on Thursday night.
According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italian.
On Friday morning, two more explosives went up, and according to the authorities, another human being was killed.
A bomb explosion was also reported by Phuket in the morning.
A taxi driver was injured in the detonation near the beach of Patong, which was popular with tourists.
In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded that killed an urban employee.
According to the authorities, the explosive rate had been set in a flower bite in front of the coastal police station.
Finally, there were a number of injuries in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast and Chumphon on the south-east coast.
It was said that there was a connection to the explosions in Hua Hin.
"The bombings carry the same handwriting," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning in front of journalists.
"We assume that this is a coordinated attack."
It was too early to express itself on possible motives - but it was probably the actions of Muslim rebels.
In the attacks, Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bombing attacks of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, said that the attacks were not related to the Islamist uprising movement or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage, which is limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok.
Instead, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In recent days, the authorities had received information on the imminent attacks in the south of the country - but they had not been informed of the exact time and the places.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
The police instructed their officials all over the country to increase security around important government buildings as well as airports, stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and amusement areas.
In Thailand there are always smaller bombings, but they are not usually directed against tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace used for years by the king of Thailand Bhumibol Adulyadej.
The Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on its homepage, following the vast number of bomb explosions, strongly recommends that the instructions of the Thai security authorities be followed.
High security risk (level 3) was applied to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, and Preah Vihear and the surrounding area.
After the conflict between security forces and Muslim parts of the population, it is not necessary to travel to these provinces.
Increased safety risk (level 2) was applied to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution prepared by the military junta.
This will also give the military great influence in the coming years.
Junta Chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos, while the country was moving towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The military unta, which had taken power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, is of benefit to itself to have led the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has not managed to control the uprising of Muslim rebels that has been fading in the extreme south of the country for years.
In the conflict, more than 6500 people have already been killed.
About a year ago, in Bangkok, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the most bloody attack of the country's recent history.
The right "identity movement" has become the focus of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
After several national offices, the constitutional protectors in the federal government have also monitored the group.
"We see at the 'Identity Movement' points of reference for efforts to combat the liberal democratic basic order," said the German Press Agency's Constitutional Protection Chief Hans-Georg Maäßen in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are being diffused in an extremist way.
That's why we're watching the movement.
The "Identity Movement" is a group of French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012.
It is opposed to "Multiculti-Wahn," "uncontrolled mass immigration," and the "loss of its own identity through alienation."
Constitutional protectors in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - already observe the "identities."
Mr Maßen said that his authority had agreed closely with the national authorities in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identity Movement' are trying to pick up their target group where it stands," said the Chief of the Constitutional Protection.
In general, extremists try to speak to them with the right language, often with poppy music.
That would be Islamists as well as right extremists.
This is not a good commercial for your own business.
The propaganda is supposed to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable there.
That's dangerous.
There have been reports from several federal states on contacts between the "identities" and afd politicians.
He said he had no knowledge of that.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind were only relevant from a certain point of view.
It is important that the party concerned - in this case the AFR - changes its direction of purpose by certain people who are extremist and thus become extremist.
It is therefore crucial to determine whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This was not apparent.
With a view to the significant increase in the number of legally motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodation, Maessen said that he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context.
But in recent years, we have found that there can be legal terrorism structures.
There were the group 'Old School Society' or the Freial Group.
It may well be that other right-wing groups or micro-groups are formed that plan attacks against asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a German or European-wide management of right-wing terrorism is not visible.
The previous groups had been established at the regional level or in social networks.
Mäßen was concerned that many of the attacks went into the account of people who had not appeared in the right scene before.
That's the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum accommodation had not previously been known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene.
"So many people have committed crimes that had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who have perhaps been politically indifferent or have chosen, for example, CDU, SPD or left, but who have then radicalized themselves through right-wing extremist mood."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes the Internet hit
It is not always the Olympic or world record that determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures.
He just disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
In the social networks, Hate became a viral Internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old ends his run with a 48-second lag and took the 59th place of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not exactly sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why is the 24-year-old still taking part in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.
This is distributed to make swimming in under-represented countries more famous.
Since most athletes are running in Ethiopia, Habte just wanted to do something else.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros Habte is getting ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the round.
Some media called him the "robel of the whale."
As a result of a "well-being book," the English boulevard "The Sun" made fun of him with "Dad Bod."
His time, he only hit with a minute and almost five seconds above the 100-metre free style, did not matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's race provided media attention.
The appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea was unforgivable, when he had to take up the free-style in an advance of more than 100 meters.
In French, Moussambani was fired at that time.
The then 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Reetsried - The owner of a store at the New Square has been stolen.
According to the police, the 67-year-old Reetshrieder had left her business on Monday around 5.30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor.
When she came back the next morning around 8.15, about 250 euros had disappeared from the register.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is no video surveillance.
Trump does not see the imminent defeat of the election so close
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is speaking at an election campaign in Florida.
If it doesn't work out with the US President's election, Donald Trump already has an alternative video.
He'll just go on vacation.
If Donald Trump lost the US presidential elections in November, he wouldn't care about that: "In the end, it will either work, or I have a very, very nice, long holiday," said the Republican candidate in a phone interview with the US television station CNBC.
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that is all right, Trump said.
He named the US President Barack Obama and the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, as the founder of the terrorist militia of the Islamic State (IS).
Within his party, more and more resistance was formed.
Post is entering the trade in electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the road seems to be great.
The post office is also planning to sell its electric vehicle StreetScooter.
The group is about to start trading with the transporter.
The post office will also offer its electric transporters on the free car market from next year.
"We want to get into the sale to third parties," said a post-speaker on Friday.
The company has been checking for months whether it is to sell its self-developed StreetScooter, with which letters and packages are delivered, to other companies as well.
The post-management board Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were always questions, for example by craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel," the Bonner Group is about to enter the mass production of the vehicles.
In the post-production, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and in the long term it was looking for a complete change to the environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're going to change the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's roads since 2014.
GfK-Leadership resigns after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK exchanges his boss Matthias Hartmann.
The retreat came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK has made it clear that the chair of the board of directors Matthias Hartmann will be all the more uncertain the longer the success he promised.
Turbulence at the top of the Nürnberg market research company GfK: After again disappointing business figures and the resignation of the management, the world's number five industry is facing a new start.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board Arno Märt is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The management of the board will take over the previous board member Gerhard Hausruckinger as early as 1 September, and will inform the company.
He is to officially take over the function of a "board speaker" until a successor for Hartmann has been found.
As a reason for the withdrawal, the company called "different views" on the long-term business policy orientation.
A company speaker didn't want to mention details on Friday.
It is still unclear who will lead the market research company in the future.
It was said in investors' circles on Friday that shareholders were most recently disappointed at the continuing failure to succeed in the restructuring that was launched years ago.
Mr Hartmann has been at the top of the GfK since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring are not yet visible after 5 years," they said.
In view of the last bad GfK business figures, any shareholder will eventually become restless.
"If that were the case with BMW, the quandts would do the same," they said.
The company had not been able to stop its loss even in the second quarter of 2016 after setbacks in the previous quarter.
With EUR 361.2 million, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
In the first half of the year, sales decreased by 3.4 percent with EUR 721.2 million.
The profit in the second quarter has mainly affected the company's lower value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The company depreciation of 139 million euros, which became necessary in the Consumer Experience business area, gave the Group a loss of 148.2 million euros.
In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK had still generated a group profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips in Krummhorn in Graben: Eight injured
In the event of an accident of a bus with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhorn (district Aurich).
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, reported to the police.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus from Eisenach, according to her, had to avoid an encounter of a truck, which was partly on the reverse track.
The bus came to the right from the road and slipped into a ditch, as a speaker of the police told Aurich / Wittmund.
"Because of the location of the bus, people could not leave the bus on their own," she said.
The fire department liberated the inmates.
Six ambulance and an emergency car came to the accident site on the state road 2.
The uninjured travellers were taken from a line bus back to the Krummhorn district of Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic meter of waste water are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the waste water plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of 2.10 Euro; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 Euro (so far 2.26 Euro) and for Azendorf 3.64 Euro (so far 2.18 Euro).
At the site in Azendorf, the waste water charge will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.
After an overcalculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 Euro per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the budget was approved by the Landratzamt Kulmbach, it was found that these waste water facilities are covered by cover.
The Kasendorf market was obliged, on the basis of legal basis, to operate the facilities in a cost-effective manner.
As of 1 October 2016, citizens and commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the wallet.
The increase in fees is between 48 and 67 percent.
As management director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the body, it was necessary to recoup the fees for the wastewater treatment facilities of the market community.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, overheads or undercovers from the previous calculation period should also be offset.
The serious increases in charges caused Schmidt by the fact that all three waste water systems were relatively small facilities with a very low waste water supply, between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.
For example, due to the low distribution base, costs for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, the volume of waste water in all three plants was slightly lower.
In addition, in the previous calculation period, all three installations had been subject to significant rehabilitating and repair costs, not least because of their age.
The facility in Azendorf was almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the Azendorf waste water treatment plant due to damage.
In the Welschenkahl pump plant, the almost 20-year-old conveyor facilities had to be overtaken from scratch and the Lopp pond treatment plant had to operate the first sewage pond after almost 20 years, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation facility was installed to continue to comply with the water requirements in the future.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary costs were covered by the advanced maintenance and maintenance costs, which should be taken into account in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were still well below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012.
Steinhäuser made it clear that in the case of the low waste water supply in the three plants, the costs of operation and maintenance were "fully met."
In this respect, Schmidt added, the market community was spared from large maintenance costs in the waste water systems over the past 20 years.
The situation for the above-mentioned installations would, in the opinion of Steinhäuser, continue to be precarious in the long term, especially as the supply area of the Friesenbachtal sewerage association could not be extended by these facilities because they are deficit facilities.
Bulgaria first recorded inflation in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were recorded.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8% according to the CPI.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, a price increase was observed in the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
As in the previous month, prices remained in the case of alcoholic beverages and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education remained unchanged.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticised as Asian caricature
Snapchat says that this filter is Anime-inspired, but some observers say it's insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that is already close to the absurd.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are unblocked, property-rotating tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All the mistakes come to the public.
Snapchat filters have been critical in the past, in which they were accused that the Blackface app would promote furtheror white skin as a beauty deal.
When some users proposed this week a filter that gave them slitting eyes, false teeth and exposed cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian - "yellow face."
They were wondering if these repeated controversy pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity.
The news and the outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat reported that it had deactivated the feature.
The company offered an apology: The filter was intended as a homage to anime characters and not as a cartoon of Asian people.
But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of vulnerable clichés.
Others strongly rejected the Anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, whose tweet about the photos was widely used, wrote that the filter was "offensive and inconvenient to say."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the opposite of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the devaluation extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling wire.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat's great audience of young people - who are more diverse in race than their older counterparts - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat's filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user, "it is much more difficult for such things to remain unnoticed than it was before," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her snapchat account, asked others to do the same.
In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that race-related controversy reflects a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices of snapchat.
Zhu was most critical of the white, only male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.
"Either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or well to say anything about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a speaker, the company has recently hired a staff member who focuses on under-represented population groups and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu said, in turn, that she will close her snapchat account and add, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not OK."
Military management falsified ISIS Secret Service Information, the Committee of the Congress
United States Central Command military members changed intelligence to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic state in Iraq and Syria than the actual state of the world would have allowed, a committee of inquiry of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of the Republican members of the Force Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Military Budget Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
Central Command, Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"News service information, which was typically deleted by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly produced a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed the actual conditions on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis of other news services," a newspaper article quoted the report.
"What happened at the Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analysis is presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The management errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report shows in detail constant problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi armed forces.
Although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their prescriptions to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before the Congress were significantly more positive than the facts" the report noted.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mosuls could start in April or May 2015.
Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, it's so much clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in an opinion.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the top of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to reduce the risk of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans launched the Task Force after they were told that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information while the investigation is continuing.
In addition, further investigations by the Centcom reports by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence are under way.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which were in line with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an excessively limited process for the preparation of intelligence-related assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," said the High-level Democrat in the Committee, a member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in an opinion.
This process, according to Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," damaged the morality among analysts and "gave too little room for different opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats indicated that they did not find any evidence of the White House's intervention by the Cencom analysts regarding a "certain political opinion."
The preliminary results of the Congress's investigation were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported the investigation by the General Inspector of the Pentagon, who was taken up after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. CmDr. Patrick Evans, a press speaker of the Pentagon, stated in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on reports from the Congress, while the investigation of the Inspector General was still under way.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."
The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).
However, last year's allegations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of the interferences of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document on how the then-government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, only provided a small crew force in Iraq, and little time was spent thinking about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic state.
Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker, according to government agencies, noted that, contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State did not have a significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries had been put into operation to sell oil on the black market.
This knowledge was not published, however, reported the times in September.
Centcoms then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislative body for his excessively positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at Central Command.
The United States is winning fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with the UK is coming
One day after she had shot three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said that she could not remember having ever done that.
"I have no idea." she said.
I am not one of the people who keep their gates in mind.
She knows that, however, the Americans are in the Olympic competition at 4-0 and are in the same group with the British in first place, which, after their 2-0 victory, remain undefeated against Japan.
Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two teams within their group will be first and second.
The first placed will be a little longer away from the strong Dutch women who lead the other group.
However the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans, through their success story, have caused a surprising vortex, four years after they ended up at the last London Games in 12 places.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey bat in her hands for the first time at three years (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at the age of 16 she became a national player of the United States, the youngest in the history of the team.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she could not qualify for the Kader.
Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.
In the following year, Craig Parnham, an English, became a coach of the national team and thus things began to turn to the better.
"A change in culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the work in London that we have now.
We've been able to pull the rudder around.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the gates in the first half of the game with a back handshake from the nearby area.
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team showed up surprisingly tough and held the level from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She carried out a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and ran the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The Shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the United States goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had to record a goal in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position" said Parnham, but how well will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
In the midst of the rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampoline
Wherever you are, no matter how late it is, it's the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a raging season run between competition and striving.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from the armpit to the swimmer to the turner to the triathlete.
You cannot turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the argument between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympic Games for the first time and a female black with dimples, could have been among those known names that are sent to Prime Time, built up by sponsors and well-being TV advertising if he were a swimmer, Turner or even fencing.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event in the same way.
Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swimming and may it reign for a long time.
But if I should make modest arguments for my particular favorite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it was in Sydney's debut, it has been so sparse for the last 16 years that many of the, I had questioned, did not know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the US sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jump and had a athlete until 2012 who made it to the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jump has a certain external charm, partly because it sounds more appropriate to the unexplained ear for a clown school than that for the Olympic Games.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but just a earth-bound enthusiast.
It has humoristic potential - the cartoon trembling of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that it essentially unites.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as "springboard."
Aging winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to have a number of falling movements (turning, piping and saltos) before they land on their feet.
They are assessed according to the official Olympic program according to performance, difficulty and "flight time."
Two-and-a-half athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
Medallion hoppers have to go further, faster, up and over in their quest for gold, sometimes to the destination, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They are not only hunting the finish line or the starting wall, but also another high-level goal in the television transmission: that of the world or the Olympic record.
The targeted pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears.
But it is also what I feel a little tiring watching these games myself.
The trampoline offers a break of breath.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she pops off, apparently unheavy as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
There is also competition here, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.
The women's qualifications and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men's on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the midst of the Olympia mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general tumult.
If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the attack and the objectification of male athletes - as the male US-Turner recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan community to be airborne.
"A generation protesting" in Ethiopia, Long a United States ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia met the government's violent resistance.
Witnesses say that during the clashes with the police, there were a number of protesters who were killed during gunfire.
Is Ethiopia about to break up?
In the last ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in the last few months, protests against the government have shaken the country and spread into more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed into the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organisations, the government's response was unmerciful.
Witnesses said that police were shooting and killing tens of unarmed protesters.
Videos in circulation about the protests that are probably from the last or early this year show how security people beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will be even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable rate.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia was anything but a model of democracy - human rights organisations have constantly led the government's repression - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents being effectively silenced.
Many were sent to exile or to prison, killed or driven to the far of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and they have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth is protesting.
A generation is protesting.
There are many complaints that cover everything from land use to the crawler in terms of power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100% of Parliament.
At the same time, the tensions along the border to Eritrea are increasing; a fight for this tidy, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been forced more or less in recent years, could exploit and rearm the turbulence.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding under the surface after years of prior chefs.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through the social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and Internet services have improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially in the case of protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians indicated that they gathered together to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia mainly Christian highlands, have been protesting in politics and economy while exploiting the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in flat-land areas.
But that's changing, too.
"We are coordinating under a umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the TiGray, which account for about 6% of the population and which are dominant in the military, in the secret services, in trade and in politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.
Analysts say he was particularly surprised to see early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special agents to process opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemiam Desalign, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the TiGray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemiam comes from the south.
Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the TiGray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a riot was 2005, after thousands of people protested against elections that, according to analysts, were apparently screwed up by the government and then stolen.
During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in the last months and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuting, and for their measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the internal abuse of the Ethiopian government from intensifying.
And she's taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amharic city, attacked business led by TiGray, and the hatred of the TiGray is becoming more and more common in social media.
Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a strange position.
The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for drone flights across neighbouring Somalia, even though it recently reported that it had closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse into an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin walk."
Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had founded ISIS had been "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy that surrounds his campaign on Friday by saying that his repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton had not been serious about the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the presidential candidate of the Republicans, whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelligently with the American public.
It also brings its fellow leaders, who are trying to protect him during an event-rich phase, into the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he could not have meant.
After he had made the statement at an election campaign on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump retreated with regard to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The tweet was the contrast to the previous day that Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he meant the accusation completely seriously.
When the conservative radio operator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn't want to know about it.
The last storm of criticism is coming down on Mr. Trump, while he has tried to focus his campaign on the economic situation because of falling demand values.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already put sarcasm in his defense.
At the end of July, he was very critical when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he said, "Of course, I meant that sarcasm."
This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to row back as necessary.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken up by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary," clarify "depending on the response." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who is watching the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is smart enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has taken an even more serious tone, as his survey values have further decreased.
A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, published on Friday, showed a great lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often charges his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humor.
But as he is more focused on the attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's joke has brought his loyal fellow leaders to the uncomfortable situation to stand with him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent allies, made a great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" said Mr. Giuliani, so he was questioned about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it backbenders, completely wrong, and that's why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed ISIS to spread out by failing to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.
Before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of going around on each of his words and being prejudiced against him.
He molested the "poor, miserable" television blackers who tried to understand him and said, "You can't!."
Some of the Democrats were mocking Mr. Trump's apology as just another proof that he was not suitable for the presidential office.
Once pushed over the price from the market, Café comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shady café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, which had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue Ladenfront were pushed away.
The Soap Cherie business, which replaced verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
It was the last loss of local people in a detrifying city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is excluded and verb is now a soap business."
But if New York is a change, then it's a new invention.
A reanimated verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old café, which is the owner and managing director of the new café.
He started working with Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.
When a customer offered to provide money for a new office, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of records.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment, too.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnments such as capers and sour onions.
There are natural travel bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, for which there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said that he had noticed a constant flow of old regular customers.
"Many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and regularly visited the verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road.
After the verb had closed, she gave up the coffee drink for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a Blended Chai Tea that day instead of her usual Iced Coffee, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and always ordered the same thing.
"I came quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my every thing bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Rosenthal still gets his usual order today, but sometimes he changes his every thing bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he didn't have a grudge about the soap business taking over the old business room.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the cold-brewed coffee of the café as an ingredient.
"I think we're going to deal with her offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoints have also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said that he intends to present it soon so that his new neighbours feel welcome.
The site also has other advantages.
A local juice store wants to fill and sell the cold-brewed coffee in the bottle.
There's a chance that the café will expand to a nearby building.
For many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the place and ordering a new coffee felt like a return home.
"I had to smell that," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his rise as President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a faible for refined delicacy on Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu on that day was a little more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree and as dessert a plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe's last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman, in her book "97 Orchard," tells about life in a house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Her latest cooperation, "A decent meal," which will appear on Tuesday at the Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snorkless snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the 1929 stock exchange crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces while Coe, 57, ate turkey with potato puree and vegetable mix.
When the reporter ordered hackbraten, the couple found this appropriate for a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression.
"Rich foods were very popular," said Ziegelman.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that would stretch the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve as dinner.
Coe grin.
"It must have been in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Women's teams bought for male field workers and freshly baked pies were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" records the ways in which the country was no longer the Slarafenland.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense issue for the Americans," Coe started to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as tense: mysterious food, such as bread and casserole, became basic food, which was used as a "wonderful way to revalue food," said Ziegelman, as cooks could hide unappetizable ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which has been the centre of American cuisine for years, has become a rarely served luxury.
Strange mixtures were tried because a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even common kitchen understanding.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, a dish of this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter, was prepared by Steigelman.
"It was not a popular addition to the afternoon," says Coe.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.
It was typical of many of the domestic recipes.
As never before or ever since, domestic economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - have been driving the country's eating habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household politicians" and to meet the challenge of turning pavement like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of historical treats.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Let-me-cake-food attitude, are particularly tasty.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he served like the million-dollar man of the world he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe.
He ate in an almost gold-plated dining room and wore a tux.
He was a wonderful non-reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to make an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs Roosevelt led the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most comforting prepared. "
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression to deal with food were discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food.
When writing the book, the couple stated that they had better understood the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law - for example, how she could not throw away food.
"She was really afraid of the waste of food," said Coe.
Ziegelman remembered, "She actually made people sick."
There was the wind bag incident.
After the plates had been cleared at Eisenberg's, they and Coe brought out a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate at lunch.
"It is called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman and added that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a fancy name.
There was no cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone dipped a spoon in the tender, brown glibber a little unwillingly.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe got a rematch three times.
Like a can-do budgeter, he said to his wife, "A few chopped walnuts would help."
Killed in a bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He risked his own life to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar devoted his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save others' lives.
Now the 30-year-old himself died in a facade bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil protection group that, according to the Bild-Zeitung, has so far saved nearly 60,000 people.
2900 volunteers put their own lives at risk in order to draw people out of destroyed houses and to provide first aid in the war area.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the civil guard, which shows him in an 11-hour rescue of a baby from the ruins of a house, went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrians a shining symbol figure in the horror of war.
As a hero, however, he never saw himself, said, "For me this is the real Jihad."
"When I die saving lives, I think God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the last bombings in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four front bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with chlorine gas.
A woman and two children died, seven people have difficulty in breathing.
"We now eliminate the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don't play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime should have hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
It's a rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed back to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and has a 1 km / h swim through the North Atlantic - until today.
Greenland sharks only get young with 150 years of age.
The Greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, and in one hour it comes on average just 1,220 meters far.
Only when it comes to it, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to an average of 2.6 km / h - and at this maximum speed is half as fast as a seal.
However, this lifestyle, which is slowly shaped, seems to be a patent recipe for an old age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least from a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
"Madness," Alexander Scheurlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock comments on this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.
Although the evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks are getting old.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, and in the end they live above all in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures of six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear on the surface in winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of the Greenland sharks accordingly.
They measured their time-lapse pace when they were spending six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.
The prey still make these sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice sea and find cadaver torching down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues have now examined 28 Greenland sharks, which brought fishermen to Greenland or Spitzbergen from the depth of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters measured.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lines of sharks with the carbon 14 method.
This centre of the lens of the eye is created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in them will not be renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the lens.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons experiments have led larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
On the other hand, in the third-smallest animal with 220 centimeters of length, the lens core contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012.
All the larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon 14 levels in their lens core, which is caused by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14-watch for a 493-centimeter-long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark at 502 centimeters is likely to be 392 years old.
That Grönlandhai females only get young when they are longer than four meters was known.
Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.
As one of the animals with 392 centimeters was probably at the threshold of gender-mature and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks can obviously be grown at least one and a half centuries.
This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates at present.
The fact that such methusalema live in icy waters is not a coincidence.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale in whose bacon was on the neck of a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was also caught in front of Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often also runs on sparkflame.
So they'll be ripening later - and they'll be getting slower.
In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much greater than with a gram elephant.
Another advantage: you have less enemies.
"A smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible early as possible," explains the evolution biologist Scheurlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources in a long life.
Construction ground in the double pack
In the recent meeting, the Council focused on issues relating to construction.
With ease, the Committee received the communication from Mayor Robert Putz that "the marketing of the recently identified residential areas can finally begin."
The sale of land in the residential areas of "road" and "Schönau-West" (the area of Bindederstraße - section 1) is no longer an obstacle to the sale of land to interested parties.
The municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau address young families and uptight seniors alike.
As it was said, builders can now report to the city hall, the local council is expected to discuss the award of the plots at its September meeting.
In order to be able to respond to questions about the establishment of further industrial enterprises, together with job creation, the Council decided to amend the land use plan in sub-areas only in the spring of this year.
For example, in the field of undertime larn, the commercial area already identified there is extended by two parcels towards State Road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city is therefore in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, with the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies that have been moved from London.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtlanden, head of the IW's field of competence financial markets and real estate markets.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU.
The so-called EU passport has so far been approved in the UK.
That's what big US banks are using right now.
Several banks have already announced that they will move jobs.
The "Frankfurt Main Finance" lobby group expects 10000 new jobs on the main within five years.
For Frankfurt, the IW, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), which unites responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks of the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervision EIOPA and the ESRB.
In Paris, although the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) had its head office, it was less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the Notenbank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervision," says IW Professor Voigtlanden.
Although Luxembourg is home to a large fund sector, it is, as in Dublin, that it is less important to have infrastructure.
Frankfurt was much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
The city also has easy commercial properties.
"In Paris, it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices," says Voigtlanden.
At the Seine, the rent for first-class commercial real estate was also 50 percent higher than on the main.
Frankfurt also offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking of business advice Mercer, the city is ranked seven, Luxembourg is ranked 19, Dublin is ranked 33 and Paris is ranked 37th.
Although quality of life is a question of preferences: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors," the IW concludes.
However, despite Brexit-Votum, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, the economic researchers think.
The power conditions also speak for this: in London, according to the figures of the Landesbank Helaba, around 144000 people worked in the banking sector at the end of 2015, and in Frankfurt it was 62500.
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
One US judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to the reimbursement of the legal costs incurred by it by the Hepats C legal proceedings with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from a $200 million compensation for the violation of two patents by Merck, which were related to the blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a US judge discovered a pattern of misconduct by Merck, including the perjury and other unethical acts.
When the action was brought on Thursday, US Secretary Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck tries to equate with Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and took ownership of laboratory work based on sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
United States-supported troops say they have reconquered full control of Manbei from the Islamic State
United States-supported troops have recovered full control of the northern city of Manbei near the Turkish border, after the last IS fighters in the city have left, said a spokesperson of the group on Friday.
The democratic forces of Syria (DKS) are currently in the city after the exodus of the still remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city.
They have released more than 2,000 civilians held by the fighters as hostages, and Sharfan told Darwish of the Manbei military council of Reuters, who was associated with the DKK.
"The city is now under complete control, but we're doing a clean-up work right now," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published her tax declaration for 2015 on Friday, which resulted in an income of USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2% for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband.
In 2015, the Clintons donated USD 1 million for charity purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in Redhonorars; the former Minister of Foreign Affairs gave an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's candidate for the Vice-President, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton publish his tax statements for the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," said Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion.
In a sharp contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and retreats in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax statements.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations, although they are not legally required to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have given a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"You're on the train," wrote Clinton's campaign officer Ian Sams on Twitter, regarding the release of the presidential candidate of the Democrats.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special advisor, said to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax checks are completed.
Trump's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of 2012 Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal raises questions about assets, his donations to charitable organisations, his business gestures and various other connections, in particular with Russia.
Clinton has already dropped to the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday, in which high-ranking Republican Trump calls for his tax declaration to be published.
On Thursday she also addressed the subject during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax declarations." she said on the amount.
Politico has reported that Trump has paid no or very little taxes for two years during the 1990s, and an economic journalist from the New York Times quoted on Friday a number of tax lawyers and tax advisors who indicate that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a subject in the campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During an election campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate has its seat here, called Trump to a meeting to exchange their tax declarations.
Buffett said he had also been subject to a tax review by the IRS and Trump was "afraid" of the voters and not the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns back to 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chapaqua, New York, paid on average an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The 2015 tax declaration of the Clintons showed that they only paid USD 100 of their income as a wage, unlike most of the Americans.
Their main investment was a cost-effective index fund from which the Clinton's dividends and revenues of USD 109,000 were taxed.

Condoms with chilipuder, fireworks bodies promote Tanzanias elephant protection
Natural protectors in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going into human-inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them filled with chilipuder.
The method has proved to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea to do so years ago, has, together with US nature conservation, intensified its support by training volunteers in villages in the north of Tanzania to use a non-violent four-stage method to protect their homes and crops without violating animals.
Before that, many spears used to defend themselves.
Friday is the world phone day dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we developed the... toolkit, we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities, and they are much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without damaging the elephants," said the managing director of Honeyguide Damian Bell in a communication.
The first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles into a horn.
If it is not scared, a so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom, the end of which is turned to the ignition cord.
When it is lit, the condom bursts with a bang and splits fine dust into the air of chili powder.
A touch is usually already out to chase the elephant away.
A final possibility is a yard that shoots a gold-fired fire into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council decides unanimously: No kioskneubau on St. Goarer Rheinufer
As a rule, the St. Goar investment projects of commercial operators are taking on a kiss-hand basis - especially the retail sector in the city of the nuclear city is considered to be clearly expanding.
However, the City Council has now unanimously rejected the request for the new construction of a sales ski on the Rhine River in the immediate vicinity of the Rheinbalkon under construction.
"In principle, we welcome new commercial drivers, but at this location in an exposed location on the Rhine, this kiosk does not fit," said Michael Hubrath for the CDU Group.
Jewish director breaks Berlin Hotel because Israeli pre-election after "Arab" call has been removed - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media rebuke after telling him that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli pre-election, as according to an employee, Arab guests "requested it."
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentation "Shoah" left out his trouble at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country list.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel has been eliminated and deleted?
= = References = =
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to choose Israel through its own call center.
After a statement, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel manager said that the measure was a "deliberate decision of the management of Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind it was even more anger in the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they have asked for the pre-election to be deleted," the employee of Lanzmann was quoted.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame," reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were horrified and upset by this event.
This is really very embarrassing.
The fact that this has been done in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even more shameful.
That doesn't need an explanation.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident triggered a pretty big response on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Some said to the Kempinski Hotel that it "had given in to the alleged requests of Arab guests."
"Shame on you," it was said in another article, which pointed out that the hotel, located at the noble Kurfürstendamm, is close to a synagogue.
The hotel quickly rejected all allegations and called the incident a "mistake" and "apologized" to Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was never a direct order to not include Israel in the fast-dial list," the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a speaker of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country's pre-election has now been added.
Police use tear gas & rubber shots against protesting Brazilian students
Students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber shots against the protesters.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to drive the students apart, which led to the police using rubber shots and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their concern about the plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are implemented to save money.
Some of the protest participants were seen to spray graffitits against the provisional President Michel Temer on walls.
The recent protests took place a few days after demonstrators went on the streets to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate for their resignation.
Trade between Russia & Iran suddenly increases to 71% - RT Business
With the abolition of the sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9% in the year.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted, the interest on the part of Russian companies in business in the country has been growing, the Ambassador informed us.
Russian companies establish existing links with Iran, while new companies are ready to access the market.
Of course, further trade development is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran, "said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and was $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports into Iran increased by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade recovery was achieved by supplies of machinery, land vehicles and weapons, "said the Ambassador.
This year, Dzhagaryan is based on a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia.
Last year, the Russian foreign representation spent about 35,000 visas, mainly travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Iran also reached the top 20 of the countries as regards the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year, are broken, "he said.
At the same time, only a few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend the visit of the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, who have received monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition," he said.
Witnesses sought: Beverage market in forest oil
A robbery was carried out on Thursday night on the drink market of Rewe XXL on the forest-brewer Gerberstraße.
Under the support of a gun, three dark-dressed people who had suspected their faces demanded the release of cash from the consumer market and then fled on foot and then probably with a silver-coloured VW Gulf.
How much money was taken, the police don't tell us.
The perpetrators were supposed to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, so relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible from the park deck of the Rewe market and is poorly visible.
The perpetrators must have run in the direction of Gerberstraße, Friedrich Engelbert-Weg after the robbery and fled from the gravel parking lot opposite the park entrance with the silver-coloured car, possibly towards B 256 (Schladernring).
Those who made observations at the time of the crime (around 7: 45 p.m.), which are related to the robbery, are to report to the police urgently.
Nagold: Game and fun at summer leisure
Eight beautiful and happy days were spent by the children and young people of the social educational day group / social group work of the Nagold Child Protection Federation with their carers at their summer leisure in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
The lively group was in the quiet area of the Hartwödle leisure home during the first week of school holidays.
Several full-day trips were on the program.
For one thing, it went to Bretten with the visit of the string zoos.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special children's guide in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the daily life and food of the Celts.
On the hot days the group at Lake Tiefensee in Maulbronn was enjoying, which invited to jump, swim and plan.
Culinary children and carers were pampered with their own prepared body food such as the Sauren Spätle, the Seebronn Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English breakfast and Tübinger Bologna.
In workshops, beautiful pieces of jewelry made of pearls and stones were created or made of wood a Roman mill game.
Other highlights of leisure were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings at the fire and the final "Colorful evening."
On the day of the journey home the sun laughed and the children and young people returned home with satisfaction.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the gate of mercy
The ministers from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna pastoral unit were on the way to a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages were managed.
In order to bridge the time until the next Roman journey of all the ministers in an estimated two years, the top minister's round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Several pilgrimage goals were examined and the Episcopal City of Freiburg was finally chosen, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage was offered with the portal of mercy opened to this end.
16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch, and Heavenly rooms were on their way.
In the evening before, Father Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrims and gave the pilgrims the blessing.
From Horb was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where there is also a Münster of Our Lady and thus the Pilgrimage road was taken by the Münster.
The individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and writing texts.
But also on the way, the minis at field crosses, chapels or churches always took a rest in order to sing together a song of specially composed pilgrim song.
For the nights were available parishes of the local parishes.
At the stages, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty and strong dinner and breakfast.
On the second day we went over Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
The next day, the stage was taken to St. Peter, which was the most difficult road, but at the same time it was necessary to go down about 500 meters of altitude and then to climb again.
The earned reward was a common grille at the Badweiher in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter it went to the final stage to Freiburg.
Visually relieved and happy the Minis arrived at the Freiburg Münster in the later afternoon and went through the gates of mercy.
With a little impulse, God was thanked here.
At the evening fair in the Münster, the Minis arrived at the Pilgrim's destination were welcomed by the co-operative Markus Obert.
After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day there was still time for the Breisgaummetropolis.
In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.
At the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Scot Callum Skinner is storming home when British gold gets for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner rained last night in the men's team Sprint in the Velodrome in Rio to glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself his own. The Jpfund made the legend proud when he stormed home to bring a victory from New Zealand's favorites.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy got the fifth of six Olympic medals.
They repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place at the World Railway Championships in London in March, despite the resignation of Hoys.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time as a hindsight.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the bulkhead that has now unfolded.
In addition, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealand won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
In addition, after his round was close to back, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A change in strategy made up a large part of the transformation, where the addition was in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and, above all, Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they got to the podium.
The 23-year-old skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.
We set up an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph on the side of Kenny and Hoys, Hindes admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track.
He withdrew this statement later and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such a surprising victory, there was no such problem this time.
And he said, "It feels like the whole GB of flags on the stand like London."
We've been together for the last three months as a team.
We got away so bad with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which was won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, that will expect us successful five days in the Velodrome.
With the form of Kenny it is in the area of possible that he repeated Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would mean that for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sport; that day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born), a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be Hoy's.
Kenny will be next in the Sprint, which will start today and go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I only enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
And he said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Dull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-mile race.
They arrived at the target in 3: 51,942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3: 51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will certainly be the focus.
He had a fight with the officer before the qualification yesterday when officials called him to measure his body size.
In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and finished tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker, and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13.260.
The GB team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a bunch of medals.
After a truly exceptional presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were reduced.
Dramas took place in the background, so the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sex and bullying, as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
But if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrome, it looks like the now legendary reputation of GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
The future of Portland's melting industry due to the lifting of the energy contract in question
The future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - is at stake as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus remove all supply contracts, as reported by the supplying energy company.
This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year not to grant any further subsidies for the operation of the plant.
A 20-year subsidy will expire in November.
Up to 2000 jobs are at stake in the Alcoa plant in Portland.
No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.
In addition, there may be dominant effects, as the melting industry consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity production of Victorias.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the point Henry Melkzerei, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's melting plant in Portland is losing money and risking closure.
This step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently as a result of the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that it is expected that three other owners will terminate their contracts.
The plant is in the majority possession of a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the plant in Portland will continue to operate, which means a further physical demand for electricity from the melting industry," the company informed.
AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called "security transactions," which should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to the revenue in financial year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential effects on AGL revenue from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL announced that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual financial statements of $187 million in "Expecting a termination."
Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the "ability of Alcoas... to operate the melting plant or to ensure the power supply to the melting plant" did not affect.
The US company said that it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have entered into force from November this year, even if it is still guilty of an explanation why it has resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn about the industry's poor economic conditions before the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
In reference to the statements of the analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity every year.
If both plants were to disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market].
And it wouldn't be good for us as a power generator, "he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder, who ran on Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday in her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The coverage was followed by a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashian's similar?), written reality video, which shows the whole Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the problems Rob and Caitlyn, as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they forget about the cover of their sister and that ends with a classic turn: they all have a surprise party planned.
This is the cliché act of almost every birthday episode of a child's show (Seacrest brought the phrase, "You thought we'd forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a broadcast site at 8: 00 in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this publicity somehow.
With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's big sister Kim liked to beat her in the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for her.
The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.
With a volume more similar to an image band than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista, from the 832 pages of the forest were 615 pages advertising).
The unveiling of his cover star is so eagerly expected that in the last two years images of the magazine have been leaked even before the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been clearly more "celebrities, models" than "models, celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar Prize winner and dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour.
But even in the low chance that Mrs Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls within the former category, she is in good society.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to make a good snapchat video (even if all of them apply to Jenner).
They are really talented women who are distinguished in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner's success doesn't like everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always a little tense.
In June, the former Victoria's Secret model, Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, criticised and called her "the bitches of the moment."
These feelings were back up when the news came out with the appearance of Jenner on the Vogue cover.
But to go around in the middle of the misfortune seems to go by at the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.
It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She's advertising for your foundation of Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling you pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.
She sells from her made pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her spare time, she's on reality TV, probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her kids.
Local law centres reject 160,000 people per year
More than 160,000 of the country's aid needs are rejected annually by the local law centres, while the sector is focusing on the impact of further cuts on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly older people, immigrants, workers in need of help, victims of violence and those who do not have the means for unjust delinquency and the like - are already being rejected in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the community, which are already overloaded, are ready for further reductions.
As of June next year, these legal centres will lose another 30% of their federal funds.
The director of the community justice centres of Queesland James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of municipal justice centres showed that thousands of people are already being rejected every year.
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without the Federal Government's decision being lifted.
"Queensland's municipal justice centres are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are being rejected from important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and extortive debts, families who go through divisions, workers who have been unjustly released - all these people have problems of a legal nature, and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The Federal Government will reduce the funds by 30% from June 2017, which means that thousands of more helpful people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Federal Attorney General and the Federal Minister of Justice, as well as the Senate of Queensland George Brandis, to lift these cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need in the event of legal problems.
Last year, the national government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of local law centres and their customer communities and to see that the government of Palaszczuk is investing in this important work.
Donald Trump is charged with election campaign after employees allegedly pulled a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was charged with alleged inaction after she was told that her campaign leader for North Carolina had directed a gun to an employee in February, while they were on the move in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state.
Bordini stated that for months it was waiting for the matter to be dealt with internally before he realized that "this would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "pulled a gun, put his right hand finger on the trigger, and rammed the run in Vincent's knee throat," Bordini reported in his charge.
After having complained about the local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he reported in the indictment.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to cause damage," said Bordini.
The charge comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment People" - gun owners and weapons friends - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and appointed judges.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words out of context and that he would not be inciting violence.
Bordini's complaint requires compensation from the campaign for the violation of due diligence and from Philip for assault and permanent mental damage.
Trump's press speaker Hope Hicks was not available for an opinion.
Try to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a member of the campaign.
No response was received to calls from his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has had a controversial campaign so far.
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin / Schwerin: Survey before country elections: losing SPD and CDU
In the forthcoming elections in the Federal Republic of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) there are significant losses for the government parties SPD and CDU.
This resulted in representative surveys of the INSA opinion research institute for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could rule just further, this is not possible after the surveys in Berlin.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance to continue to be the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD crashed from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party was only just in front of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
The third place is disputed between the left and the afD.
The left would be at 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AHD would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country day.
The Greens, despite a slight loss of 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent), moved back to the Schwerin Land Day.
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the country day at 3 percent each.
According to the survey, the SPD would only reach 23% in the Berlin House of Representatives election (2011 election: 28.3%).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It was still behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but before the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AFR would be represented at the House of Representatives for the first time at 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, while the pirates would miss the move in 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The First Smartphone
E-mail and Internet in time: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came on the market.
The successors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it was not well in the hand either.
On the contrary, it was pretty big.
The built-in memory was at first eight megabytes, which would now be enough for about two high resolution selfies.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into business exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they are somehow from the stone age of the Internet age.
20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hannover as the "office in the western pocket format."
In fact, the new mobile phone could reach a lot for then standards: SMS and emails could be sent and received, also by fax the communicator was available.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser, even though it was very slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be wound up like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, that is about 1400 Euro.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
No one could know in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.
Everything's been different since then.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The Finns' mobile sector experienced an unprecedented disaster, was finally sold to Microsoft and handled.
Today, the market is dominated by providers who all came much later than Nokia.
Being online all the time, this is for a lot of people's everyday lives.
In 2015, there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, and Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million pieces.
The worldwide turnover of the equipment is around 400 billion euros.
In addition, the well-running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies will be included.
A whole industry has now developed around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, when Apple's boss Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone at the Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicator, all easy to use by touch screen.
The victory of Apple began, and today the iPhone is the most important product of the group.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the look.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
Now Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung are in charge.
The smartphone is a self-evident 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day.
"We all need to learn to put the smartphone away," said Janina Kool, responsible for staff in the Siemens Board of Directors.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time.
England must guide the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity throughout the country, not only in our local communities and all over London.
For me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just as it was in 2012 in London, when we made a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympiade brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new jobs, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
As they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be embarrassed on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question he has asked.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for some.
Enlargement is one way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, to create £211 billion of money growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from the T5 - which was chosen five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, to the T2, which was built in the middle of the two most frequent routes in the world.
Now they are ready to provide a third stage, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time for us to guide this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, while securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "cat and mouse game" for display blocking
For companies that make money using online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to avoid ad blocking are the same as a "cat and mouse game."
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blocking on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it reported that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising again in the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the encoding of its advertising ads to make it difficult to identify which part of the advertising page is.
But Adblock announced that it found a new way to circumvent the new codes.
In a blog post, the speaker of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of hin-and-her-fight between the display-blocking open source community and the reverse has been going on since the invention of display-blocking agents," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of how worrying indicators have become for the industry.
According to a study of last year by Pafair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use display blockers; almost four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of the advertising income of Facebook.
The company is looking for ad blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a speaker reported.
Advertising on desktop PCs represents a sufficient share of revenue, so Facebook seems to be worth the investment of such a step.
On Tuesday Facebook announced that it would update its "ad preference tool" to give people more control over targeted advertising.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that is not advertising.
"This is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to address the problem," a Facebook spokesperson reported in an e-mail message.
Ad blockers are a blunt means, which is why we have instead focused on developers' tools such as ad preferences to put more control in people's hands.
A woman in suspected suicide on the Swiss highway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses after a woman was hit on a highway in the early hours of the morning on Thursday in a suspected suicide of several vehicles.
The incident occurred on A1 near Morges in the Canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay down on the street in the dark "in an act of despair" and were hit by several cars, said the police in Waidt.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the ground.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said the police, who, as well as every witness of the incident, is asking them to report.
An investigation was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, and Gilles Hofstetter informed the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
This is something the prosecutor has to decide, "said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases in the last five years have shown that drivers are not being held responsible.
In each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that the drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of negligent killing after she ran over and killed a man who was one night on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and became unconscious on the street, heard the court.
The court found that the police officer -- who had responded to an emergency call -- went in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," said the judge.
Anyone who has more information about the incident in the vicinity of Morges on Thursday should report to the police under number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA Klimamodell: Venus was once inhabitable
The Venus was probably once habitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate teachers.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have once had earth-like conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.
Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still turned slowly.
The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to house life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow turn of Venus exhibits its day-to-day side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun's heat.
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus, which is similar to evolution, which was previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although it was once probably habitable, Venus - over the course of several billion years - was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapour was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen was removed, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide was left behind with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letter.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche and led to too little participation in the decision-making process of the team.
Alternative President / General Manager of the Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said the 50-year-old Roy in an opinion.
I have long and much thought about how I could improve this team in the course of the summer to give it more depth, that it needs and to bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the trainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly aligned to that of the organization.
He must also have a right to co-determination in decisions affecting the performance of the team.
These conditions are not currently being met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me about this decision today," said Sakic.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
= = = 2013-14 Avalanches = = = Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach in the league during his debut season.
He led the club to 112 points and first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the playoffs of Minnesota and missed the post-season in each of the two last years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 brand in the 2015-16 season and fell back behind the game for a second game card spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers are reopening talks, disclosing strike
The work struggles on the pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended, while all parties to the dispute are in favour of a new round of talks, said negotiators.
Strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out sporadic on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group, as well as the Unite and RMT trade unions, can confirm that we have agreed to relaunch the resolution process of the current dispute," says a joint statement.
We will hold a few full-day meetings in the next few weeks, which will start at the beginning of next year to address the problems again.
The trade unions said that their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
Wood Group has this year reduced the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The company's rate reduction follows a 10% decrease for on-shore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional reductions give the company the space to get through the market downturn.
Shell has released thousands of people for its part and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries, as it rationalizes its business activities as a result of its merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that was reinforced by the decision of the British to leave the European Union in June.
At the beginning of this week, Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with workers' leaders to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that have taken place in the North Sea since a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for many and not only for few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the cluster of stars of the Plejades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the cluster of stars of the Pleiades.
The new data will help astronomers understand why stars in the cluster of stars are rotating to different rates and in what context the rotation periods are linked to the creation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The cluster of stars of the Pleiades is 445 light years away from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster, which was created about 125 million years ago, now reach adult age.
They're turning the fastest.
At peak rotation rates, these maturing stars cause large amounts of starwinds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a brake effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a visible star spot -- like sunspots --.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars are turning slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.
"In the" Ballet "of Plejades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, while faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
As the cluster of stars of the Plejades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The cluster of Plejades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
There is still much to be done about what we want to know more about, how the how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and, so to speak, hang up their "dance shoes."
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the rate of rotation of the plejades, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star resigns
The tears ran faster with Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in the best days from base to base.
After his emotional resignation, the 41-year-old professional will last wear the jersey of his New York Yankees on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say good bye to both," said the 14-time all-star game participant of the Major League Baseball (MLB).
In 2009, Rodriguez won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract has given him $27 million a year since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will be a consultant and youth coach - with full salary.
As a player it paid Rodriguez back for a long time with performance.
With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and the Yankees since 2005, he created a few milestones.
With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays only two more baseball players have similar values in the main statistics.
But the 41-year-old should not be included in the glory hall of the baseball.
For as successful Rodriguez - the nickname "A-Rod" - was in the field, his appearance outside the square is controversial.
As early as 2009, the superstar admitted that he had taken out the steroids that were banned between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was closed for 211 games by the end of 2014 due to a process in the so-called biogenesis scandal.
Rodriguez is considered to have been the main suspect of having received performance-promoting funds through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida for years.
After a legal dispute, the lock was reduced to 162 meetings.
"The league could even have done me a favor for 2014, because I played for 20 years without a break," said Rodriguez at the time.
His days of good-bye, too, don't run without a sound.
While many baseball legends in their last games once again get the big stage, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job does not include a farewell tour."
"My job includes trying to win every game," yankees-coach Joe Girardi dared.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz, who was relegated to the situation with Popstar Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy-of-the-fans of the Yankee Arrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the followers sang in the 4: 9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases
Acknowledged: Due to a positive doping test, weight-lifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland is not allowed to start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A caught athlete would have won almost a medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping cases became known to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre obstacle runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the start of the already critical athletic competitions these news come to an end.
Chen had already been shown last Sunday to be the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had the fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen was supposed to take part in the foreruns of over 50 m of free-style.
Chen has requested the opening of the B-sample and a hearing from the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and requires Chen to cooperate fully in the investigations," said Xinhua in a communication: "We will work with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment."
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for sanctioning the athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio, the news about the positive sample at Danekowa was passed through, the 33-year-old went into the offensive himself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," said the Bulgarian TV station BNT.
It was innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," the light bulletin said.
According to the report, the forbidden substance is to be the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekowa was provisionally suspended, according to BNT the B sample was already positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissov immediately spoke with criticism of the Athens.
"I don't understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgaria are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weight-holders from the chronic doping-loaded nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic winner in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolon like his brother Tomasz three days before.
Both deny the intake, but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the light athletes, the Danekowa case is a further major blow to the reputation of the entire sport.
The World Federation of IAF had banned the whole Russian team from starting, except for a systematic doping, and the run-off of Kenya also produced many bad news in Rio.
In the swimming field, the previous crimes in China had also caused serious conflicts between the athletes.
This is how the French attacked Camille Lacourt, the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang, harshly.
"Sun Yang pees purple."
"When I see the stage over 200 m of free-style, I want to turn myself in," said Lacourt on the French radio.
Sun was also at the centre of an argument with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping traitors," he said.
In 2014 Sun had been tested positive for the Stimulan Trimetazidine at the Chinese championships, but only had to sit a three-month lock.
Data claw: So perfide extorts hackers their ransom
Programmers of extortion malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey of malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been at least once, in part several times, victims of an attack with extortion software in the last 12 months.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies were already the target of a Ransomware extortion.
40 percent of the victims were willing to pay the ransom required by the perpetrators in order to be able to re-use the affected systems and data.
The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes on attacks in company networks.
If they are successful there, the potential ransom to be extorted is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently watching a horribly fast evolution of the malicious software," explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kreczynski in conversation with the "world."
In 2008, most of the Malware programmes were still designed to send advertising.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.
First, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place horribly quickly in the last few months.
Ransomware works for a simple pattern: Once active on a victim's computer, she is looking for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and permanently delete the originals.
The software then presents the demands of the blackmailer.
To get the end-key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
But where private users are at stake the personal photo database is about sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is stopped.
Consequently, the damage is higher if a Ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the German companies concerned reported sales losses from Ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely stop business, in one case people were in danger of life.
In Germany, hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
"We always tell the victims: do not pay, you only promote the problem," explains Kreczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
It is difficult for managers to reject the perpetrators' request in the event of a standstill in the operation.
The hackers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, the F-Secure security researchers have examined the user interfaces and contact with the blackmailer and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain to their victims by chat how to pay by bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt example files for free.
And if private people are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies will have to negotiate in part hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from the ransomware blackmail, the hackers are becoming more professional and share the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski of the antivirus provider Sophos explains: "A single person can write a ransomware about within a week."
However, it is more likely that they are three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software kit to the actual blackmailer.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a single, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.
"An adjustment tool is included in the scope of delivery, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers then look for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log into one of the forums in the underground, buy the set from a criminal and order another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per computer infected.
"Usually, the criminals then charge Spammer with the spread," explains Wisniewski.
The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data.
More than 50 percent of company IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to defend Ransomware using file back-up and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful recovery, the perpetrators instead threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes-Chief Marcin Kreczynski.
This means that the potential for damage is much higher than before, depending on the type of data.
Also, in the future, the perpetrators could take completely new targets on the Internet of things.
At the Hacker Conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the release of such a blocked heating could be worth a ransom to some of the victims.
If the perpetrators then, instead of heating, block a whole production road in a factory in the future, Ransomware could also become a subject in industry 4.0.
One for sure
HONDA HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which was designed on the same new platform as the new jazz, is actually very flexible in everyday life.
Although the HR-V is only 1.60 m high, passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the fund, it does not seem close in any place.
The materials of the interior are well-processed and seem pleasant, only the cockpit top is a little off.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage room.
There is not only a trunk of 453 l available for high and 1026 l for folded back rests, but there are the "Magic Seats."
This is less magical than it sounds: the seat areas of the back seat can be folded up like kinossel and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the ground to the ceiling.
The trunk can be loaded well, but the charge height at 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very vigorously thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
He should, however, do his work a little less.
The daily consumption is 4.7 l / 100 km.
There is another engine: a 1.5-l petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamic and comfort.
But the steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment does not leave any wishes open in the tested top version "Executive."
The safety systems include the city emergency brake assistant (works to speed 32), the collision warning system and the track stop assistant.
The collision warner sometimes irritates because he considers many obstacles to the ranking as "approaching objects."
The long-distance assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent temporegler reacts to the traffic sign detection and, if necessary, the speed is shrinking.
The full connectivity is available only for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI socket are under the armrest and are therefore a little difficult to reach.
The around 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are all right.
If you don't want to invest so much, you get the petrol from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro-6 exhaust gas standards.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
For liability is only possible in the case of risks typical of air transport, the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124 / 14) argued.
The plaintiff had broken a knee in the fall.
However, the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life, according to the court.
The airline didn't have to pay the man any damages.
Sickness: When does the organizer pay
The only way to get money back after their trip is to find the cause of the disease without any doubt in the hotel.
However, this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have been shown to have the same symptoms.
In the case dealt with, a family was severely affected by diarrhoea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkish leave.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
Their disease led the holidaymakers back to a defective treatment plant, which allegedly had polluted the sea water.
The family felt that the journey had been defective - and complained against the organizer.
In court, the applicants had no success.
The waste water treatment plant was indeed defective.
But the organizer only learned about it just before the applicants left.
He had to assume that the sea water was fine by now.
So he did not violate his information obligations, according to the judgment.
Especially since no impurities were found in the samples of the water.
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly by infection among themselves - is a general risk of life.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.
The state had to respond to terrorist threats at the same time.
It is certain that our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not give this triumph to the terrorists.
However, if criminals need to leave the country more quickly, this will increase security and also strengthen the people's support for refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals by the 2017 Bundestag election.
He also announced further human resources strengthening of the security forces, "on a medium-four-year scale."
The fight against terrorism must be repunished.
Video surveillance is to be improved, arms law is to be revised in such a way as to make it particularly difficult to buy weapons on the Internet.
The last much discussed obligation to remain silent for doctors is to be maintained according to the Maizières words.
However, in the dialogue with the doctor, he wants to find solutions to reduce the danger to the citizens, he said, for example, to mental abnormalities.
In order to prevent the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers that better social support is necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared to deal with traumatized people.
In order to persecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans to use hidden investigators.
SPD Chief Gabriel said, "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
It was important that the Minister of the Interior had made a clear statement against activism.
"This was an earring for the sniper in the CDU / CSU," said Gabriel to the newspapers of the Funke Media Group (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected Union calls after a Burka ban and the abolition of double nationality.
He considered that a general ban on full cover-up was a constitutional problem.
You can't ban everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burka.
You can talk about rules, for example in road transport or for witnesses in court.
Green Chief Simone Peter accused the Minister of trying to simulate the power and ability of action with ever-new anti-terror packages.
Left party leader Bernd Riexinger said: "Fleet proverbs and a tightening of the right of residence do not bring any more security to the people of this country."
Better traffic flow on the motorway
It is regularly on the bypass road - here is a picture from November.
But this is to change: the legal basis is to be extended.
This is a good news for all drivers who are in traffic on the surrounding road every evening in the congestion when they drive over the motorway (A 43).
The state-owned road construction company will extend the right-turn track by 700 meters on next Tuesday and Wednesday (16-17 August) in the area between the Hammer Straße and the Weseler Straße departure.
Drivers can then turn right directly from Hammer Straße.
The great advantage: the traffic is more early, thus improving the overall flow on the much-used section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU Group in the district of Münster-West.
The road narrowing on the train is particularly annoying by the drivers between 5 and 7 pm.
On working days the back stop extends to the bridge over the Albersloher road and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needle watch on the B 51 just before the departure Weseler Straße.
From here on, the traffic is only one trace across the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt a good three-quarter years ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load to take up the heavy-duty traffic in two tracks.
How long this bottleneck and the associated work-day congestion will last, the competent national holding cannot say.
However, there are years to be expected: the bridge has an official rest period of use until 2034.
For the extension of the legal basis, the national company has deliberately chosen the less-favoured time in school holidays, because it is likely to be disabled.
The traffic is carried by the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural travel: cultural offers for schools
The international class of the forest school visited the play "The invisible house."
The Nima's Association and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project.
The Nima's association allows young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited an idea of the award-winning piece "The invisible house" of the young theatre Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by the Nima Association, 19 students between 11 and 15 years of age visited the small house.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds, has been offering schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster within the framework of this project.
Most of the young people in the class came to Münster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria between September 2015 and March 2016 and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenes and video animations, they were able to follow the course of action, according to the press release of the young theatre Münster.
The Nima's association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Young Theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without a background of escape and migration between 14 and 20 years will be given the opportunity to visit professionally guided courses in the fields of singing, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in the planning process.
The project "Intercultural Journey" continues.
In view of the increased numbers of refugees, the association expects many classes to participate.
Rain instead of star-sniffing: hope for weather improvement
The weather in the south-west of Germany has made a prank through the bill the night of Friday - but there is still hope.
The night was bad for watching the sky spectacle because of clouds and rain, said the chairman of the Welzheim Observatory, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night of Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, so we'll see a lot of starships in the sky.
The star shed is the perch, which, with 216000 kilometres per hour, is one of the fastest star-snips.
They have their name because they appear to come from the constellation of Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Recreating night: tips for sleep disorders
In the evening you walk around forever, you lie awake for hours at night, in the morning you can no longer think of sleep well before the clock ring.
That's all but relaxing.
After all, one is in good society with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of the adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently than not relaxing.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders express themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be based on a variety of causes, stresses Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of directors of the German Society for Sleeping and Sleep Medicine.
But what you understand in the country is the insomnia, that is, a sleep-in and a sleep-through disorder.
It is precisely the sleep-through that many people feel unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of directors in the German Hauskärteverband with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.
What's behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
There can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also drugs.
The sleep disorder is not rarely the expression of another disease.
"Very early wake-up is common, especially in the event of depression," says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors are interdependent.
For example, if you have a tape-disc incident, it can be bad, you wake up every two to three hours and you may start to grovel about everyday problems and concerns, you can give Weeß an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you go to the doctor with any sleep problems?
If you do not sleep well for a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by the day, go to the doctor, tell Weeß.
The impairment may look quite different: one is turned off, tired, unslept, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood fluctuations or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache.
In order to relieve the sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes.
The treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or also medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.
There are hardly any low-end sleeping doctors in Germany, stresses Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.
Therefore, in the event of sleep problems one should first turn to the doctor, Weeß advises.
He can work out if the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep lab, and what's going on?
For example, for the study in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise in the case of snorks with respiratory suspenders, in the case of sick daily fatigue, in the case of sleep hikers or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder, Fietze explains.
You don't have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normal.
"Just don't sleep for lunch," says Fietze.
After the wiring, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear a nose glasses, a chest strap and a foyer on your finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping person.
How can the problems be addressed by those involved?
There are quite a lot of fixing screws that can be used for a better sleep.
Weeß counts on: regular sleep and rise times, not too long in bed, not sleep in the day, not watch TV to sleep, avoid alcohol and don't look at the clock at night - then you start to calculate immediately, and that is not at all conducive.
What the jungle camp has to swim with missing medals
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler has spoken out on Facebook about the disappointing cut-off of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he won the first gold medal at the Doha Short Railway World Championships, and at the same time, he recorded his first world record.
Now the former DSV-Athlet Markus Deibler has been protecting himself from his ex-team colleagues in the criticism.
"In a country where an Olympic winner gets a $20,000 prize and a jungle king should not wonder about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on the night to Friday.
The support system for swimming was bad, but the doping controls were very good.
We cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely at or even operate it on the subject of doping.
"I am not saying that the controls are to be stopped here," he said.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
That's exactly how you should keep it with countries.
"Those who cannot be controlled by independent WADA / FINA controllers for a certain time before World Cup / OS may not participate," calls for the election-hamburger, who is now operating an ice-cream shop.
Airport: gang of luggage thieves arrested
Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport
On Thursday, civil officers of the Düsseldorf police managed to arrest two women and two men aged between 50 and 61.
The suspects had committed several pocket and luggage theft as a gang.
At around 9: 30, civil officials in the area of Düsseldorf airport recognized a gang known to the police from past theft crimes.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July this year, and had taken action in a joint, labour-intensive and particularly professional manner.
The specialists of the Criminal Commission 34 can prove four actions to the thieves who had specifically entered Germany for the purpose of committing crimes.
They had received a total of over 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few loins, in between, another stone patch: The Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem that way at first sight, but the police are one of the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you walk the road from the east to the west, you pass the playground, a fresh-cut kindergarten and a biolad.
On the facade of a grey house someone spilled "ugly!."
In contrast to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, is already being built: by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be created here.
However, articles about this "trendy district," as the relevant real estate company Friedrichshain calls, have been preferred in recent weeks with burning cars.
The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, now the residents have rent contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, Berlin's interior senator Henkel has been in favour of a hard action by the police against the project, calling the area "no-go-zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence.
After the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers on June 22, the police have been patrolling official statements for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, blocking parts of the street and stopping visitors from entering the house with the number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers, on behalf of the unknown house owners, renovated the rooms.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court decided that the clearance had been illegal, and one day later, police and construction workers withdrew under the cheering of sympathizers and residents.
This summer afternoon the road seems peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about late.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, who is raising three children here, are above all enriched by the police presence.
With the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern for increasing rent and gene trification.
It doesn't sound like a gill that wanted to get a majority of police protection from vandalizing left.
The ditch opened by the Berlin Interior Senator and the police between the housekeepers and their neighbours does not appear to exist.
Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which today also has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
In 1990, many houses in the former GDR were occupied, including almost the entire Mainz road, very close to the Rigaer.
While the Mainzer had been cleared in a right-wing street battle under a large police order, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are sometimes still inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and electors from all over the world: with them, people from East Germany and former housekeepers are now sharing their pegs.
This is also noticeable in the case of rent, which has increased by almost 60% since 2009 in the case of new rentals.
Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols of this development: you can see them on inlaid slices or freshly carved facades, which were thrown with color bags.
No other road was mentioned so often this year, together with the words "left-wing violence."
One reason why not all neighbours consider this a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crime such as assault, according to statistics, is almost exclusively directed against police officers.
Most of the crimes are material damage, which tend to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house for 17 years next to the controversial 94, there is no question of uncertainty.
As far as violence is concerned, the people in the 94 are their neighbours, they certainly were not.
Also the famous burning cars have not been in the Rigaer for a long time.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere."
Neugebauer has consciously moved to Riga Street - and remained.
That is why it was so important for the residents to get their streets back: from the police, politics and the media, who all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents as well as new buildings, the road is still taken away from them: by faceless new buildings in former building blocks, which expel the old inhabitants.
"These are condominiums that are not interesting to many here - more people who are not so well-educated live here," she says.
"I can't at all approve of violence and destruction."
But what do you do if no one ever listens to you?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
For those who are attracted who are angry about colour bombs, Santa Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene were part of the peat.
Those who move here should be aware of this - just like those who move into a bar district, there can be bad complaints about noise.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the partner in the field of integration and organisation.
She is also a social worker on the ground.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach.
The social education team supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, work group refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else is involved.
Regina's customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the impending Wollmilchsau, who has a problem above all.
For example, some of them - less mocking than rather aimed at the many areas of work they wanted to do - meant that the administration wanted to write down the job.
An administrative expert was sought with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just an overexploitation of the Wollmilchsau.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
The main issues are organization, work with people on the ground, and also behind the scenes and network work.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
She has a 50-percent position limited to three years.
"It was high time," says Regina Kendall, that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and senior actors.
There are big and small problems, organisational, human and understanding problems.
Soon there will be new containers in the Wasenstraße
It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the contiguous refugees that have been recognised.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection.
They must place the refugees in their own or rented homes.
The costs of building, renting or renovating these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility changes from the Landrat to the municipality and the Jobcenter.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.
It does not work so far, however, that one is dependent on private homes, says Deuschle.
It is therefore necessary to make public housing, as it is so beautiful.
So new containers will soon be installed in the Wasenstraße.
But only with apartments it is not done.
Perspective is the keyword, Regina customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a fixed stay, they are traineeships, training centres, schools, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or set up.
"More places would be good," says Regina.
Many work in the Bauhof or help house masters, do non-profit work - and this is motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that work for the community will lead to a positive external impact.
This is "no employment therapy."
But activity is not just work.
The day needs a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People should develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with local people and especially language courses.
Professional courses are rar.
So here too, administration and volunteers are entering.
It is central that refugees get the feeling that they are wanted and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the procedures was a problem.
They must explain to the refugees that it takes time and that they can make a good start, for example with language courses.
Those who eventually develop the feeling that they can't help anyone in Urbach should not work and be useless will never integrate.
The clear majority was motivated.
However, there are also problems, customer honestly says, "People who are not going anywhere." The work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.
All this is already a "mammoth task."
A difficult question: are they afraid of radicalisation after the recent events, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regina's client very clearly, "what some may call naive." But a residual risk could and would not exclude it.
But the helpers are already sensitised.
These incidents were also the subject of refugees.
They'd be afraid the assassins would put them in complete disrepute.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with this," says Regina's client.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So the main and honorary officials on the ground and in the region must look for activities.
They always have in the background that soon a new blow to refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a ceiling?
It is a matter of political concern to answer this question clearly.
Actually, it's not fair to put them in the field.
"We have not yet arrived in Urbach where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
The regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher are already equipped with a reasonable integration of the people to date.
These are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they have to be helped, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: A burglar looking for a helicopter
The police helicopter flew off different areas for about an hour - unsuccessful.
Two unknown men entered an apartment in a family house in the Lindenweg on Friday morning around 8: 50.
The inhabitants surprised the two and put the unhold in the run.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, probably masked, both were wearing bluejeans and black hood pulls.
They fled to the city center.
The police used a number of strike crews and a police helicopter to hunt.
The search went without success.
The unknown may have noticed before the action near the apartment or on their escape.
Baden-Württemberg: Police investigating after rocker attack on snack
After an attack on an Ulmer snack, the police are investigating six suspects from the rocker environment for serious land peace breaks.
In the case of housing searches, evidence and the drugs were guaranteed, the police reported on Friday.
According to the police, about 20 masked men of a rock-like group had thrown bottles and stones against the window of a snack in July.
After that, they were supposed to have attacked two guests and slightly injured one.
Then they fled.
At the snack and the adjacent building there was a damage of 10000 euros.
According to the investigators, there is a dispute in the Ulmer Rocker environment between a Kurdish and a Turkish gang.
