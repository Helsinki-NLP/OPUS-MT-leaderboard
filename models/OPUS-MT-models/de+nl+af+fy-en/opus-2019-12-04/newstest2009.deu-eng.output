The Prague Stock Exchange is going to fall into the minus against business closure.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
The transactions with ČEZ's shares reached almost half of the normal daily business.
The Prague Stock Exchange joined the break-in of Monday at the beginning of the Tuesday business when it fell by another six percentage points.
This time the reason for the break-in was on Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic too, the market response to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Case of shares in Asia
On Tuesday, the shares on the stock exchanges in Asia experienced a dramatic case, although the indices were able to compensate for some of the losses during the day.
The index of the Hang Seng stock exchange in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points over the course of the business day, but later it was able to make up for some of the losses, thus the decrease was reduced to about 2.5 percent.
The index of Hang Seng China Enterprises, which observed the movement of Chinese shares on the stock exchange in Hong Kong, fell by 3.8 percent, and markets in Shanghai were closed.
The shares on the stock exchange in Sydney lost more than five percent, but then reduced the losses to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan stock exchange fell by 3.6 percent after the index there.
"The timing of the US rescue action is uncertain and will influence the financial markets worldwide," said the head of the monetary authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although it belongs to China, determines its monetary policy itself, that is, independent of the Chinese central bank.
Hong Kong's interest rates are at the same level as those in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the American legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft financial system support.
Otherwise, other countries would also be affected by the break-in.
A bloodbath of American shares
On Monday, the American House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which up to $700 billion (almost 12 trillion Kč) should be spent.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would regulate the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and thus help to stabilise the entire economy.
The American shares experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the main stock indices recorded the largest break-in in in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost seven percent, a similar break-in he last recorded in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there was little evidence that the draft would not be able to get through in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress makes concession: US government is allowed to pump 700 billion dollars into the banks
The top representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an agreement on financial support for the American financial system.
This is to be voted on at the beginning of next week.
The American legislators achieved a breakthrough in talks about the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial contribution to the American financial system of $700 billion (about 12 trillion crowns).
However, this does not mean victory.
The congressmen still have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the final version of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated in the American Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, Barney Frank, said this to the Reuters Agency.
In the Senate, it is likely that the plan could be voted on at the earliest on Wednesday.
According to economists, a communication on the adoption of the plan should be the first important psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
However, this will lead to a "softening" of the complex mechanisms that could also help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on what a package should look like to stabilise the market, "said the Democrat Nancy Pelosi to the agency Bloomberg.
According to her, there could be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met with American finance minister Henry Paulson on the night of Sunday to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for a purchase of unsold mortgage assets from the financial companies that are causing serious losses to the financial companies and at the risk of the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.
You have to continue the health plan, but I think we're on the move, "said Paulson.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is also clearly reflected in the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to the words of the democratic senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators were trying to reach a final agreement before Sunday in Congress.
That is why we wanted to calm the investors before business on the Asian financial markets, which lie in the first time zone where a Congress decision could affect business on Monday.
So far, however, it is not quite clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, but there is also a lack of clarity as to whether the negotiations could not fail at the last minute on a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days.
But the law will still experience some changes.
The total amount of aid for the system will be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion will be made available as soon as possible as President George Bush asked for.
But Congress can block the payout of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, with another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush appreciates progress in negotiations
The President has a right of veto in this decision, but Congress can overvote its veto.
However, despite these changes, the basic idea of the programme has remained, based on the fact that it is to obtain finance for the purchase of bad mortgage securities, the value of which has fallen, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday about the law, then the Senate on Monday, "said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush was also satisfied with the progress.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Bush was satisfied with the progress of Saturday and "appreciate the two-side effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of golden parachutes
The Chairman of the Banking Committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, the leading negotiator, stated that the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the conclusion of benefits and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called gold parachutes for directors of the companies involved in the programme and to set up a committee to monitor the fund.
I want the Ministry of Finance to run this one.
"We have worked very hard on this and we have made great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also expects help for home owners who have problems with the repayment of their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates for mortgages it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for the debtors and allowing them to keep their houses.
Marek: Psychological help
The proposed plan is a good idea according to the main economist of Patria Finance David Marek, but implementation will be very difficult.
"This is because you do not know what mechanism and the price of the problem assets are being purchased.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and government split the losses among themselves, "said Marek to the server iHNed.cz. this week
Whether the plan is adopted now or at the beginning of next week, Marek's view is not decisive.
"It is much more important that the congressmen agree to support the plan and that they adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on the adoption of the agreement is at this moment the most important, "said Marek.
Duel on Messers Cut: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you in your choice
While almost every phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can yet call.
So, of course, it looks like it's better to just buy a phone.
In spite of all this, there are enough reasons why you should be a separate player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the requirements of the future owners.
I'm sure it's hard to buy a very expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
Once such musical innovations do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues in the shelf, you probably dream of at least one.
This is also the case with the music on travel, that is, with compressed music, in a simplified way - music in MP3 format.
Here too there are price and quality categories.
For the one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, but a pink Floyd fan will probably be able to handle headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough room for everyone.
The selection is wide-ranging.
The life of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can do, they don't even make it clear.
No modern device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, the telephone and the masking, there can be music and videos, both of them can be recorded, it has a better, sometimes a worse camera and may also be able to navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you have almost a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill and no TV can photograph.
But the universality of mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your phone, however, the more often you will need to reload it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Only a few mobile phones can play music for more than ten-twelve hours, usually it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the most simple) are much more powerful.
That's why you should expect the cheap phones to be able to play music for no longer than a few hours.
If you still make calls from time to time, you'd better buy a charger for the office - that also applies to more expensive equipment.
With MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good keep at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation off with once charging.
Another problem is if you want to overplay the music on your phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices have a USB conclusion, and not every mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can overplay the music directly to a memory medium, but only a few card reading devices are finished without reduction with the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones.
For players, you do not need any special software except for exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players themselves create a music library, ordered by the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the evaluation by users.
Some devices only represent the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can be more
When selecting a specific device, you should especially check the life of the battery, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of sound and of course also the comfort of the operation.
Is music especially for you and listen to them every day just for example in the tram, then any phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
Which is what almost every cell phone can do.
You don't have to control which music formats a mobile phone or player can process.
MP3 will create everyone, and most of the music you get will be in this format right now.
The format is among the most common, and most devices can also play music in the WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better phones also allow the purchase of music online.
You only need to call the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can in itself and in itself be a striking argument for why one should get a music phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of providers is bad and is usually limited to fast radiokits.
The prices are also not the lowest.
In general, however, it is assumed that this kind of sale of music (whether it is via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will in future dominate the music industry.
The cell phone is carrying most of it.
If you want to listen to something, grab the phone in the jacket pocket while the player is forgotten at home.
It is important, however, whether you carry headphones or at least a wireless free-call device with you.
If not, you can use the integrated speaker that almost every phone has, but only the least MP3 player.
The biggest advantage of the music phones will probably be in the price for many.
The cheapest usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a very decent walkman.
The biggest handicap for most people will be that there are no normal headphones.
The best and most technically mature phones with a 3.5 mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the players is in the easy operation.
The easiest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really be used by anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity in operation with the previously normal cassette recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
There is no risk of a collision in the form of an incorrectly created mobile internet and a subsequent hedging account for data transfers.
What device should you now reach for
The cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) also have a slot for replaceable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are enough.
But be careful.
In the case of the basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are usually supported.
Only the most expensive can also read 8 GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, you can use Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you will not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, prefer to take specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent control buttons for MP3, and the control comfort is thus connected to the one single MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the single-sold MP3 player.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) provide MP3 players from the above mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is already coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, and the Czech service providers offer virtually all services, as they are offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, there is something missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic at lower prices.
Maybe this one won't be waiting long.
The fact that Czech mobile operators are the most expensive in Europe, we have often reported on Mobil.cz.
This was also confirmed by the telecommunications authority ČTÓ, which pointed out that the price of a text is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to arise - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How come prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really makes a fight announcement.
It may sound paradoxical, but in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
On the other hand, mobile operators like to be ashamed that there is an extremely high level of competition in the Czech market.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTì) Pavel Dvořák, who had often said in the past that there was no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic provider with its own network no longer has a lot of opportunities (by the way, he would probably not find any more frequencies).
But there is another possibility - a virtual provider.
In particular, the entry of virtual providers into the mobile market resulted in a significant price reduction, to which the classic mobile operators also had to respond.
There were similar voices to those in the Czech Republic before such companies, such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, entered the market in the UK.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
By the way, you don't have to look for examples for long.
In February of this we reported on the launch of the virtual mobile provider in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and thus become the five largest provider in the country.
The Penta financial group, which has, among other things, U: fon in the Czech Republic, is behind mobile.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to work effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, the virtual providers usually benefit as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, but this is often accompanied by a less extensive service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS in the UK at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of mobile learning in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good move to put on a non-cliché target group.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
"Real guys choose mobile - the provider they like and can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator company of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept to that in Poland could be found in the Czech Republic.
The press speaker of Vodafone Miroslav Čepický also doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
It is also relatively saturated from the point of view of the service offer. "
In the Czech Republic, mobile telephone operators think
But it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile service provider conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be mobile.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look particularly hopeful.
There will be more to a market entry of mobile services in other countries of our region, "says in a phone call for mobile.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to do so.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything they can to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
Their interest in the launch of a virtual mobile service provider has been showing for a long time the GTS Novera group, which wants to take a further step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed network but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have already been able to make progress in the negotiations, "said the press speaker of the Pavel Kaidl group.
Maybe we'll have better times now.
Non-official information shows that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
But so far this is surrounded by an invincible wall of silence.
"At this moment, we do not assume that there is room for a full virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has large specific features in relation to other markets.
So far, no subject has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area, "says in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefónica O2.
Other suppliers also point to the specific features of the Czech market.
The press speaker of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the O2 statement: "We have not yet found a viable and mutually beneficial project to build on."
And it adds: "In the network of T-Mobile, hardly a virtual provider will appear by the end of the year.
At this moment, we should already have a concrete offer to think so in the short term. "
Vodafone is more focused on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický means: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
This is precisely what we consider best from the customer's point of view.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet. "
The responsible authorities - with the providers hand in hand
The approach of mobile operators is easy to understand, another is more competitive, which would lead to lower prices and thus to a fall in profits.
So why should such a competitor be easier to enter the market?
The fact that the providers can draw a line when it comes to something also proves the long back and back of the creation of U: fon.
The most powerful pressure in the direction of ČTů was now from the company T-Mobile, when you: fon came on the market.
This is also demonstrated by the publicly available information from the ČTț websites.
But now you are right: fon as an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The competitive field of the mobile market has also recently been strengthened by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile service provider.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that a new player would make high demands on the market itself and, above all, its services. "
However, in view of this approach by mobile operators, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
This is not just the attitude of ČTÄ which, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic - in contrast to the United Kingdom and other highly developed countries - does not have the power to intervene in economic competition.
It has only the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, referred to this whole problem in its very typical position.
"The entry into the market of a virtual mobile operator would be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile telephone provider and a virtual provider on the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic suppliers, "said Kristián Chalupa of the ÚOHS External Relations Department.
Such a formulation would not be surprised by the representatives of the suppliers.
This is more than a concern from an authority that is responsible for the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one uses their position on the market.
In particular, if Kristián Chalupa adds: "In a foreign country, where virtual providers work quite normally, it is observed that their entry into the market has contributed to a reduction in the price of mobile telephone services."
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction are probably not one of the interests of the ÚOHS.
In this case, the almost already existing agreement between the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions, is really shocking.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolutely same petrol price at the gas stations is certainly only a coincidence and the result of a hard competition.
"The Authority has not found any evidence in this case that indicates any action against competition, and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the suppliers have a dominant market position, so they do not have the appropriate increased responsibility for their actions on the market.
The necessary instruments to open the mobile market to virtual providers are probably also missing from the telecommunications regulatory authority, "said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, prepared by ČTì, according to which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile operators have a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - the agreement of the network operator is always necessary for the entry into the market of a virtual provider.
And the mobile telephone provider has - logically - the monopoly for its network.
This means that it necessarily takes a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if you do not go along with this argument, it should at least be a warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are acting in a similar way.
In this respect, complaints from a number of interested parties (including the company GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all suppliers.
The transfer of responsibility to ČTÓ is then a very common trick in telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS disregards itself from the whole issue.
This was already observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recent amendment of the Telecommunications Act has not been able to implement the extension of the ČT's powers to economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts have promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS only need to know that too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's all right when no one looks
The operation of any pseudo-virtual provider, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks, is not taken into account.
They are companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but they are only partly public.
They are usually companies that operate in the field of multilevel marketing.
For example, mobile phone services offer Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only come to the chosen ones.
The joke of the thing is that the company appears to the operator as a classic company, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer he will then receive special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, it may be an infringement of the contractual conditions with which we will then deal, which may lead to an end to cooperation with the relevant society," Martina Kemrová answered our question on this issue.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing will not be discussed with the operators of mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned above, they can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator is opposed to such an approach.
In fact, they do not have negligible profits from the activities of these companies, at the same time they are not affected by the actual official marketing, in contrast to the actual virtual providers.
Miroslav Čepický draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows such types of speculation, despite all this, the services of these companies are used by a very small percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card does not run on their phone, so they cannot fully have the same as the normal customers of the mobile phone providers. "
This alone, however, should at least seem strange to the ČTì.
There is also another question for the ÚOHS.
If the mobile telephone providers close their eyes before such a procedure, why are they blocking themselves from a virtual provider?
It is to be added that the ÚOHS has quite strong powers to detect such activities, and if it does not want it, it does not have to be satisfied with the statement by the suppliers that they do not know about it and their terms and conditions would prohibit it.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has been pointed out several times in the text, the entry of virtual providers has brought a significant decrease in the price of the various services.
In this context, in virtually all countries where virtual providers have been created, the classic suppliers have tried to prevent their emergence from being practically more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a too small, or too saturated market, problems in the quality of services, etc.
In the advanced countries, however, the regulatory bodies, which did not try to protect the interests of mobile operators, but their customers, were involved in these moments.
Whether it is through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created and followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are throwing themselves at the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that ambiguity in the skills in these cases is more than favourable.
But let's not throw the gun in the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider is soon to emerge, the Czech mobile market may soon get back on the move.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting (discriminating against) other interested parties.
And the Czechs will finally not make more expensive calls than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Find out the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem where is my home country on the occasion of the Czech state's day in a celebration.
The hymn was rerecorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo song, in choral version and in an instrumental version.
The song was taken over by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The members of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had already told the Czech radio that he had chosen singers with young, representative voices for the solo variants, which are striking and popular.
"From the beginning, I have tried both and then also with the choir to keep a clear fiction, so that you understand the text well, so that a match can be made," says the conductor.
The Czech national anthem will be celebrating its 175 anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj was first recorded on the stage of the permanent theatre in 1834 in the original Czech piece Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music was produced by František Škroup.
It became popular, and people took it spontaneously.
The first verse of the song became an organic part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
It remained one of the seven state symbols after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" hymn sound
The Prague transport companies will also transport on a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will enter the history of the Prague transport companies as a date on which the first passengers, instead of a paper ticket, will enter the subway, tram or bus, who will carry an electronic coupon in their pocket.
These can currently buy about one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or annual oupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and can play it on their chip card at the same time, in the information centres and branches of the transport companies at the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letany, Kobylsy, Rajská taurada, Kačerov and Luka.
Since yesterday the coupons are also available on the Internet on the pages of the transport companies www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use the Internet sales can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they have to wait regularly for their paper tickets in long queues.
They buy the coupon over the Internet, it is recorded on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"At these places, the traveller is also available a switch with trained staff, who advises interested parties when buying the internet and also plays the coupon on the map," says the speaker of the Martin Opatrný project.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coupons can also be played on self-control machines on the open card, which are installed in some underground vestibüls.
What do those machines look like?
They are red, they are reminiscent of a ticket, the passengers may have noticed them at the Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
"At the moment there are five of them in the city, but by the end of the year it should be eighty," adds Opatrný.
The coupon controls a machine instead of the driver
The operation of the machines, which will work from tomorrow, is easy.
All you have to do is enter the chip card, and the previously acquired coupon is on your own.
The electronic coupons will apply from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburbs and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which the inhabitants of the municipalities of the region of Central Bohemia in particular get to the capital.
"In the trains that belong to the Prague integrated transport, the train attendants have reading equipment with which they can check the validity of the coupons after time and zone," explains Filip Drápal of the Ropid organisation. This organisation sets up the timetables for the Prague transport companies.
The suburban buses have card reading equipment at the checkout at the driver's place.
When entering, the chip card must not only be shown to the driver, but the Opencard must be placed at a marked point on the side of the checkout.
The driver controls the validity of the recorded coupons.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the recorded coupons, nothing is easier than to ask the driver for this information," Drápal said.
A passenger who does not drive on suburban buses and no longer knows when the coupon's validity ends can go to the self-control machines, where the coupons are recorded on the map.
The information on the validity of his documents is shown on the display of the device.
The Sudeans called for a referendum from the United States
In 1945 the Sudeten Germans had asked for the division of the Bohemian forest to the United States.
This is the result of a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the auspices of the United States of America.
With such a wish, in 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans turned to the US President.
This is reflected, among other things, in a letter that has been preserved in a private archive, which is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
The Germans of Krumau ask the American President in the letter that he should not allow the return of the "Sudetengaus" - which was taken on the basis of the Munich agreement of Hitler - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure of the words that American units do not enter as oppressors and enemies of German territory, but as liberators," it is said in a letter that is signed with the words "people who are the victims of the fate of the dead."
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia makes the Sudeten Germans - in the knowledge of the Czech National Charter - suspect that they would expect brutality, recklessness, ununderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over the protection of the Bohemian Forest for today and forever.
"We cannot believe that, without taking into account the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you are speaking to a state that is foreign to us, which is trying to suppress and eliminate minorities and has not contributed anything to the victory of the Allies," is to be read in the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of revenge from the "Czech oppressors."
If the President of the United States had doubts about the attitude of the Böhmerwalddeutsche, it would be enough if he were to initiate a referendum in the Böhmerwaldgau on whether the inhabitants would become part of the United States or want to live under the protection of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naive in today's history of the post-war history, it does, in the opinion of some contemporary witnesses, have a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Even though the Bohemian Germans at least had to think that they would be negotiated about their deportation from the Republic, only a few of them agreed to such a possibility at all.
Some were waiting for the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate a kind of autonomy for the Sudeans.
Others thought they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who is from Budweis.
He was used in the war as a Budweiser German at the Navy on the Baltic Sea.
When he came to British captivity at the end of the war and was taken to a prison camp in Holstein, dozens more Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they were to come home, the Czech would come to fit them," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war were expected to be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
You don't think - then pay!
An emotional campaign is aimed at drivers
The most expensive action on road safety in Czech history.
In this way, the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport wants to start on Wednesday could be characterized.
The authority of Minister Aleš řebíček promises to remove drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the steering wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will be on TV, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to remove the drivers from driving too fast and alcohol at the wheel.
And they also remember to get ready to go.
The campaign is aimed primarily at young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
This also shows the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't think - then pay!
The words "don't think" are in capital letters on a label.
And in a blood laugh, the word "pay."
This means that you can pay for a moment of inattention with your own life.
The spots will "shock" the audience by 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see quite normal pictures with dramatic images of accident victims.
It is expected that the number of accidents and the number of deaths on the Czech roads will fall.
The spots were compiled by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Bread of sugar and whip for the drivers
"The motto of sugar bread and whip is for the drivers.
Sugar bread means that when they drive in red, for example, they save time.
The whip is then the threat of a punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk, "said the transport psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Kořán.
And that is why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, the psychologist says.
In his opinion, even less effective are tables that make drivers aware of a danger.
"If you set up a static board that warns you of a danger, it will probably soon flow with the environment, and the drivers will no longer notice it," Kořán says.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The chairman of the provisional Israeli government of Ehud Olmert has expressed his support for the return of virtually all the areas occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan heights, if we can make peace with Palestine and Syria in exchange for this.
He stressed this in an interview published on Monday by the daily Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it is necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," said Olmert to the newspaper.
"We maintain a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar high percentage (Israeli areas) because there will be no peace without this," he added.
He admitted that a possible return would also include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, does not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as one of my best friends has done, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," said Olmert, in an allusion to two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temple and holy and historical places" located on the territory of the old town.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work, "he continued.
Deduction from the Golan heights
Olmert was in favour of a withdrawal of Israel from the Golan heights, which he considered to be an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require certain efforts on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to make peace with Syria alone and on the basis of a departure from the Golan heights," Olmert confirmed.
"The Syrians know only too well what they have to do to get the Golan heights back.
They will have to renounce their current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to renounce the constant support they give to the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the Al-Khaida terrorist network and the Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq, "said the Prime Minister.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards illegal on the bus?
The law does not know her, in a long-distance bus it is not allowed to walk around
In the context of the tragic accident of a bus from the company Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question arises as to whether stewards and travellers may walk on the bus during the journey.
"If we were to comply strictly and formally with the law, the work of a steward would be contrary to the law on road transport," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident that killed a twenty-two-year-old stewardess last week was probably caused by the truck driver who crossed the bus.
The young woman sat at this moment on all the bad luck next to the driver, on which the least safe place in the car, although she had two more places available.
A bus can also have an accident or a sharp brake at the moment when the steward is out of coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role whether the bus is equipped with standing places according to the vehicle letter.
If this is not provided for in the bus, the passengers must sit.
The long-distance buses of Student Agency have no standing places; as confirmed by the director of the company, Radim Jančura, compared to actuálně.cz.
"This is what we discussed with the Ministry, and this was not the first time that the movement of travellers was agreed.
Later, this was taken back, and we reached a consensus that passengers may go to the toilet during the journey if they have their seat, "he said.
The law does not know any steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is no legislation that prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The law on road transport only knows the term "vehicle attendants," but it does not define its rights and obligations, "the spokesman of the Ministry of Hanzelka adds clearly.
The Director of the Road Vehicles Department of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný, on the other hand, believes that the law will cover this issue afterwards.
"It is important to know whether the bus also has standing places in the product authorisation.
That's all, "he says.
Buses are divided into urban buses, where there are standing places and the maximum speed is limited, local buses with standing and a higher allowed speed and long-distance buses without standing places with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, the expert says
The BESIP road safety expert Jaroslav Hořín does not see a fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board a bus.
"In the case of a liquid mode, not many risks are threatened, the situation is similar to the service on board an aircraft.
Even here is not sure when turbulence will come, and the stewardess can hit his head. "
"But if a bus stops sharp, then of course the laws of physics also apply.
Just like the city bus or a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified by internal rules, "he says and also thinks that this problem is not fully solved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to remove the services
Student Agency offers Stewards services as the only bus company.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The Director does not consider her profession to be risky even after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the career of the steward is risky, I will delete it.
Coffee and newspapers can be obtained by the passengers when they get in.
That would also reduce costs, "he said.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin founded the lack of stewards in his buses. However, his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency.
"We have no stewardesses, but we are already fighting it from the beginning.
Sooner or later this ends with some fatal accident, "he had not said quite a year ago for Týden.cz.
That was an incredible tragedy.
In the accident of a line bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the region of Pilsen was lost, who had worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian truck had probably turned off without blinking and had blocked the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid by a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front part with the truck.
That the two places were sold for the stewards, Jančura disputes.
"These places cannot be reserved for remote connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the Agency will not wait for the court judgment, but it will expect financial compensation from the guilty.
A change of law?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring about a legal regulation on which a thirty-head team of experts of the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
"However, this has not yet come to a concrete conclusion.
Also buses are not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones on the road, "said expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the stewards to be something that could significantly endanger the safety of passengers," says Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of buses being the responsibility of the police and the labour authorities.
Düsseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt
There is no lack of large words in the letter from the WestLB board to the employees of the house.
By merging units of the Düsseldorf Financial Institute with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen Financial Group" is stated in the letter that became known on Monday.
WestLB introduced a "competence block" with sustainable yield into such a business.
And at all, such a link could be the decisive incentive to further alliances in the national banking sector.
This is how it reads when a board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in a difficult time.
The attack on WestLB is still under enormous pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Services Supervision Institute, which the North Rhine-Westphalia State Government has recently made clear, the time has come to find a solution to the future.
However, a link between the Deka-Bank, which is familiar with savings banks because of its investment funds, and the WestLB has been mentioned for some time - also on the Frankfurt side.
Although Dean-Bank-Chief Franz Waas made known in the presentation of the half-year figures at the end of August, in a merger of the house on the Mainz Landstraße with a Landesbank, such as the Helaba or the WestLB, he does not see any sense.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deca, which is each half borne by the Landesbanks and the savings banks' associations, has instructed the Board to hold discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be about the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks have, of course, just begun at the financial centre.
The Deca-Bank, which with its 3000 employees is one of the most important employers at the Frankfurt Financial Square, is not the first time mentioned in terms of consolidation in the savings-bank sector.
In 2003, it looked like the Deka Bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba for a moment.
But there was nothing out of this tribal.
The plans had hardly become public, the Hessian government opposed the participation of the Helaba.
The other two houses were not found together.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz then went to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been thought games about a connection between the Deka Bank and Landesbanks.
Last but not least, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Helaba Board, had spoken out against the plans for a meeting with his house.
However, regardless of this, it seems to be maturing to realize that the different houses of the public sector are in need of a close-up.
After the election of the Land Day in Bavaria is over, the first thing BayernLB could do is to get closer to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
This is not necessarily a good news for the Helaba.
If the pressure to further mergers increases, the partners will gradually assume it.
In the south, it would be just more junior partners, although it has so far been through the financial crisis much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In turn, a meeting with the West LB, the savings bank and Giroverband Hessen-Thuringia, which is involved in the Helaba at 85%, set a bar at the beginning of the year.
At best, love the North LB.
But such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of the individual houses fit each other.
In June, Merl expressed the crucial question of what business model should be used to ensure the future of the Landesbanks, had not been answered by the German Sparkassen and Giroverband.
In the end, the West LB could also be dismantled, but it is not desirable there.
This is also the case in the letter from the board of directors there, that there is in any case an "overall solution" for the house.
It is still going to be shown how this can be done with the interaction of individual units with the Deca-Bank.
The second week of the week is known as the "Italian weekend"
For Elena it's the first time, for Luca the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is with him as his friend, and so be it all different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-litre beer barrel of the Kaiser brand, is a massive-built bear and proves to the about 200 Oktoberfest traveler what deep tones can produce his throat.
Elena first gives Luca a slap, then a kiss.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, the bus park next to Puorta Nuova station, this evening four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra," are expected to be arriving at 6.30.
Three buses are mainly reserved for the Italians, on a bus only Brazilian travel.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are already singing next to their flag, they have already celebrated at night.
And so loud, Marco Guarda says it's not for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with fur-zimite food and glasses with wide silver iron, belong to the buses.
For five years they have been going to the October Festival, three tours this year alone.
At night, during the day on the Wiesn, at 10: 30.
Overnight would only mean unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
75 Euro costs the journey, the welcome drink with Kaiser-Bier, with the Bavarian order of purity, health insurance and the German-speaking tour management - Marco has visited a language course in Frankfurt - including.
And the buses are already rolling into the night, on the autostrada direction "Brennero."
There's no beer, not yet.
It gets quiet on the bus, the travellers sleep.
All right, they're gonna need their powers.
It is held in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where also several other buses with Italian signs on the 8 motorway take a break just before Munich.
When Marcos group finally arrives at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese, at the beginning of the morning at half past seven o'clock, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco has one last speech, explains the attack plan.
First of all, put on the yellow box.
On the left is "Oktoberfest," in Fracture, next to the Internet address of Marcos travel office: "conoscersiviaggiando.it."
Second, "When the doors go up to the beer tent, it's running!" Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the places in the back of the tent.
"Not front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow hats on the same benches, in the room!"
The measure, roars Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the tip.
"The security people show that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the places, they will be gone! "
Third, "Get back here tonight, point 9: 30!"
And we're going to the Wiesn.
On the way a yellow cap binds to the trees, to signs and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian People's Party.
You want to be ready for the retreat.
It is known as the "Italian weekend."
There is no precise information on the figures; the talk is about 50 000, which are on the way over the Alps and are coming into the beer tents, ten percent of all visitors are supposed to have come from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are strengthened by seven South Tyrol police officers, and Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which has a national statistics in which the Italians before British (about 60 operations) and Austrians (about 80) take first place with about 200 medical supplies.
The court is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed only in the past week.
How good that the politician used the word "relative" and also inspires that the German banking sector is not spared from the critical developments.
Because it has now entered the weekend.
The Munich real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), listed in the Dax, receives a billion loan from a consortium of German banks to shield itself from the turbulence on the markets.
A person familiar with the situation said Reuters on Monday that the loan was up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate only had to galvanize the part that it also uses.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
The background is losses to the daughter of Depfa.
According to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he has given money, the State's financier had refinanced himself in the extremely short term - which is now no longer possible because of the lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the Bank's cash reserve had been reduced by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio had also slightly increased from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the previous year's period, income from amortisation to claims and certain securities and from the resolution of provisions in the credit business fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher revenues from refunds of downstream settlement costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and from the refund of interest under the tax order and from business concerns for group companies, the profit reduction had been moderate by around 16 percent.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state-funded company had first speculated with commercial real estate loans, which had then been broken down into Aareal Bank.
Because the traditional state funding was too low, the Depfa had then been more involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of Community projects of private investors and the state (private public partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate now has to write down, which will have a "substantial material effect" on the group's profit and loss account, it is quite undetermined.
The fact is that the dividend has been deleted.
It had already been reduced by two thirds in 2007.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure financier since the Depfa takeover.
It is more dependent on the refinancing of the interbank market than other institutions because it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the lending among the banks has again largely increased, as the banks are hedging their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funding for a part - around EUR 50 billion - of the credit portfolio of the Deppa.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group's financing needs are covered by the loan in the foreseeable future and the company "is protected" from the influence of the currently largely inoperative international money markets. "
It can be heard from other sources that, thanks to the funds, the refinancing is guaranteed by the end of 2009.
The HRE CEO Georg Funke said that the Hypo Real Estate Group would no longer have to use the money markets in the foreseeable future.
Bundesbank and the Federal Financial Services Supervision Institute (BaFin) assume that the market capacity of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now guaranteed.
This is to be hoped for by shareholders and creditors of the Bank.
But in view of the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not even unthinkable that funding does not have to be fully used.
But even the opposite is not to be cut out.
After the late Sunday night of the hearing of the bank was still before the insolvency, the at least provisional rescue cannot calm the mind.
The share price will fall by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, the bond prices are fairly good.
If the priority debt is hardly moved, the rates of the subordinated bonds will be more pronounced.
In particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary of Württemberg Hypo are concerned and understandably the maturity beyond 2009.
If Hypo-real-estate bonds were previously a speculative alternative to investment, their value must be considered to be dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the significant tightening of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only taken over the crisis by taking over the Depfa.
As long as the central banks, governments and less-favoured commercial banks are still ready to support the system, as long as it is possible to assume that the pensions will be paid in due time.
Or it will happen that, at the moment, hardly anyone else dares to hope - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in view of the reports that have been overhauled by the partial nationalisation, the likelihood of security has at present become only a legitimate hope.
This should especially prepare long-term believers for some sleepless nights to decide whether to separate themselves from their commitments.
In any case, short-term investors may use a final line to form a loss statement for future repayable tax payments on subsequent years' profits.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is to introduce himself to Tachibana High School on the first day of school, the girls start to giggle: The German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
I had Bammel before school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and take a 40-minute train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find that way on my own, but I'm glad I didn't get lost.
The beginning of the teaching does not seem as strictly defined at the Tachibana as at our home in Lower Saxony.
The students will enter from eight o'clock until at twenty to nine a short discussion with the teacher, the 'home room' begins.
But before class started, I was about to introduce myself.
I'm not the guy who likes to talk to people, and I'm not the guy who likes to talk to a class of 40 students.
Because I didn't have a school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt of my host mother, including blouse, blue knee stockings and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I put myself in front of the board and tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, coming from Germany and having a birthday in a week.
At that moment I was very glad that I had already started learning the language a little over two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all been chatting, ticking and waving and I have always heard the word "Kawaii."
I already knew that from my mangas.
It is part of the vital vocabulary of Japanese girls and means' cute, sweet '.
Then I snuck into my place.
The girl next to me smelled pretty wide, she thought it was an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the Gong sounded, I was quite disturbed.
They all talked and gagged and asked me holes in my stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
At the break, all of them unpacked their bentos.
My host had also made me a lunch box - that's something else than the dead German break bread.
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and some kind of meat in the tofumantel.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I'm eating here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
I'm sure it's all really good.
Well, except for the salty plums, maybe, brrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl gives a boy a self-prepared bento, which she then makes particularly artistic - in the hope of getting to know the boy at the break snack.
That's what I read in my manga comics.
I'm just wondering if I can watch this, too.
'Why, then, Japan? 'my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I used to say:
"Because I'm fascinated."
After all, I've been reading mangas for years.
And so that I better understand the comics and the culture in it, I started to learn a little Japanese at some point.
So it was completely clear to me that I had to travel here at some point.
For I also have a faible for tradition, customs and customs.
And you put great value on them here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I have not yet felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen. "
Rats also have feelings
A rat or a sheep flees in danger, does that mean that she also feels fear?
The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
Only how could you check that they feel the same way that they're acting like us?
In the Internet magazine "Edge," contributions of famous scientists have been published for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove this so far where we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and deal with questions of feeling or, in general, of consciousness, we enter the rough terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it is dead, fleeing or attacking.
People are similar, from which some scientists point to a comparable subjective experience.
I don't believe in that, though.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits associated almost always with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its participation in short-term memory and in the execution / control functions).
This wide region is much higher in man than in the other primates and seems to be completely lacking in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic character is likely to lie in the linguistic nature of man: Since such a large part of his experience is linked to language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In that case, you could rule out animals.
But even though consciousness does not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, as it may be, may be very different from most of our states of consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it can neither be measured nor, because of the special hardware, analysed by our own experience, his research presents us with great problems.
Most of my remarks refer to the content of the conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness, which is likely to be more scientifically accessible.
One could study the awareness processes of animals without regard to their content, and this is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially on the example of visualization.
But in this approach, which was followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, one is more likely to rely on the neural correlations of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also stresses the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the state of visualization.
What is the result of the sensations?
I return them to the fact that an emotional system such as that of fear is activated in one of its own conscious brain activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we are in when the activity of the brain-located defense system (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) proves memory.
In this way, sensations are closely linked to the regions of the Cortex, which are primates and, in particular, people.
Connected with the linguistic nature, there are fine degrees of feeling, because we can differentiate and categorize states with the help of words and grammar in order to attribute them to others as well as ourselves.
On the other hand, for example, Antonio Damasio thinks that feelings from more primitive activities in the cortex and the brain stem are similar to Jaak Panksoap, which is more focused on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed very much in the course of human evolution, it may well be involved in cross-generational sensations.
I cannot, in theory, contradict this, but I think it is inexplicable.
Panksoap argues what appears to be fear in rats and people, probably feels the same in both cases: but how can one check whether rats and people feel the same when they behave similar?
A sheep flees in danger if she also feels fear?
In my view, mere behavioral resemblance cannot yet prove an equality of living.
The neural comparison helps: rats and people have similar brain strains, but do not even give a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove it to the human being, how did you want to prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even sheep (who knows?), have feelings.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably fundamentally different from ours (as human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behaviour rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress on the neural level is waving, provided that the same is measured in rats and humans.
As I do not study language and consciousness in rats, so do not feel, I do not know if they exist.
You may think that's short-sighted, but I'd rather move forward than walk into a wall all the time.
I'm just a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that the preparations would soon be put under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the Uefa decision in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise the EM together with Poland," said Vasjunik.

Angry Dennis Quaid beats back
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview about private things - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood Star Meg Ryan outed her unmarried Dennis Quaid as adulterer.
He's ashamed - and he's beating back.
Late Rosary War in the ex-couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now have an unpleasant fight with each other - in public.
In an interview with the US magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan had expressed himself for the first time on the reasons for the failure of the marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of the fraud has not been shown until after the divorce.
The occasion for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of an adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outings as an unfaithful husband was clear: "It's amazing," said the 54-year-old of the "New York Daily News," that "Meg rebuys and recondenses the history of our relationship for the time being."
It is also "regrettable" that the 16-year-old son Jack is again "publicly reminded of the pain and the upheavals that mean a divorce for each child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has been married again and recently became the father of twins.
And so his invitations close with the sidebar: "My life goes on anyway.
I appreciate that I have a wonderful family that is doing well. "
Prices for tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights have even become up to 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have again become cheaper - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and found a significant fall in the second quarter following an increase in prices in the first quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have increased for years, the nights have already been reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 out of 48 European cities studied increased by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
However, prices were already 3.6% lower than in the previous year from April to June.
The most clear trend was in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year before.
As a result, American Express sees the weak dollar course, which has led to a "diminishing travel lust of American tourists."
Financial places such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the fall in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices, with an increase of 26.3 percent, even keep the record in Europe.
The trend in the first quarter also showed up in the case of air prices:
As a result of the kerosene rate, the economy-class travellers had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, and fuel-intensive long-haul flights even increased by 29.2 percent.
From April to June, the prices of the economy-class tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in the business and first-class, the price changes were much lower.
In Germany, prices fell even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had increased by 11.9 percent, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
According to the study, prices have even halved on German domestic flights.
The reason for the price fall is, on the one hand, the decline in economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market is crumbling.
On the other hand, the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalizes air traffic between the US and Europe, has increased the competitive pressure.
The tense situation was the removal of unprofitable routes from airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that would have declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - in Europe alone, these were 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1: 0
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburg SV will be a table leader.
In the Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to find a functioning elf.
By Kristoffer Klein, a break landing for national player Marko Marin is increasing.
The Gladbacher came into the game late and failed with a lever to the latte.
His message was precise, she was convincing about his lips.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need the second gate," said Hermann Rieger in the hall of the Hamburg Arena.
Much was not going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most of them were back in their places.
Rieger was a physiotherapist of the HSV for almost three decades, and he enjoys a higher reputation than many of the unconnected actors.
And so his request also found hearing in the responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's chief coach Martin Jol.
His command will have been similar: Here with gate two!
The implementation was not completed.
"It wasn't all nice to see today," Marcell admitted Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhardt would also have wanted it "more relaxed."
The 1: 0 (1: 0) the hamburgers owe the head ball hit by Mladen Petric (11); and the fact that very weak Gladbacher could not hurt the weak hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
The Hamburg SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
The spectators celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and the flash table on the video wall, which showed their association as a class primus.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to set this up," said Marcell Jansen.
He knows that the tabular interim certificate is more for the unpredictability of the league than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its late-duty access - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric and the Jansen, who was recruited by FC Bayern - is slowly, but is not yet able to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribblings," asked Jol.
After the vote
There's a fear going around on Wall Street.
First news of the failure of the rescue package made the Dow Jones break in at times by 700 points.
That was the biggest point loss in one day in his history.
Later, the Dow caught up with something.
Around 20: 30, the world's most important stock exchange barometer was recorded at 10.579 meters with about five percent in the minus.
The technology exchange Nasdaq was at more than seven percent in the minus at 1548 points.
The largest loser was at this time in the Dow American Express, which lost just under 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could win.
The shares of Bank Goldman Sachs accounted for almost ten percent.
It was only a few days ago that large investor Warren Buffett had been involved in the company.
The purpose of the rescue plan is to provide funds for the purchase of so-called "bad mortgage papers."
However, the sum is not to be paid out at a single rate, but rather gradually.
In return, the State should receive stock options from the financial companies that could be redeemed in the event of the appropriate course development in order to reduce the burden on the State Bank.
Share rates in Europe and USA in the downward sog
The billion support for banks in Europe and the US does not address the investor's doubts.
The share price of the German large bank Hypo Real Estate is falling and the Dax is ripping down.
The US index Dow Jones loses despite the government's planned rescue of the financial market.
Spectacular price losses of the Hypo Real Estate and the Commerzbank have made the German stock index (Dax) deep into the minus.
The share of the Munich real estate financier, despite the rescue action of the federal government and private banks, temporarily lost three quarters of its value, which Commerzbank gave up by more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly slipped under the psychologically important 6000-point brand and recorded with a minus of 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
The world's stock markets went to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors were afraid that the US government's $700 billion rescue package could not be enough to get the financial markets back on track.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10.809.25 points in the first trade hour.
The US House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, the vote in the Senate could follow on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE index first gave up by 3.2 percent, and the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese leading index of Nikki fell by 1.26 percent to 11.743.61.
In Hong Kong the slope-seng index slipped by 2.1 percent to 18.286.90 points.
In India, the central index of Sensex lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12.595.75 meters.
In the MDax, shares of Arcandor returned after the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has drawn the 23 million new shares.
The trade and tourism accounts also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook are not sold.
Dark matter affects flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in research has caused insanity: Dark matter has influenced the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity Albert Einstein could not be quite right.
Almost 18 years ago, the space probe "Ulysses" flew through space.
Because of soon-to-be-frozen fuel lines, you are now threatening the cold death.
A mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion among scientists for years - the swing-by anomaly.
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes in which they receive additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the Sun Sun Ulysses.
But what the researchers have been surprised at for years now is that the missiles do not behave 100% as they would be expected under the old Gravitational Act.
In fact, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes are unexpectedly getting faster or slower.
So far, the physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him, Swing-by-Anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even the general theory of relativity Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of matter by curvature of space, could not be quite right.
The American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study from Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was not mistaken, and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly by means of the so-called dark matter that astronomers have made up in the universe.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the earth," he writes.
The space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It is obviously an attraction whose effect on other celestial bodies can be observed.
On the other hand, it is completely invisible, that is, it does not send and reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of the scientists, the dark matter is at least one fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hand of their kidnappers, the tourists who were dragged in Egypt should be free again, as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had called for several million euros of ransom.
In a shooting before the release, six hostages were killed.
In the south of Egypt five Germans have been kidnapped.
We're already in the process of ransom negotiations.
The Germans are always on the lookout for kidnappers.
WORLD ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arab TV channel Al-Arabia and Italian media in agreement.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release according to reports from the Italian television station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We're just checking her health, "said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians and one rum, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, were well-run and safe, reported the Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background to a shooting before the release of the hostages remains unclear: According to an Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers were ready to stop the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom, "said the official.
It was "only about receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers shot six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and arrested two of them.
The hostages had requested from Germany a ransom of six million euros; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" reported by calling on a German mediator who delayed the release of the hostages because the kidnappers were afraid of their security.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men should be held until the kidnappers have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Abuse of the stepfather "led to suicide"
The years of abuse by her stepfather has led to a woman killing himself, has been reported to a court.
Michael Treise, 57, from Stithian, Cornwall, received a six-year prison sentence after standing eight cases of sexual abuse.
The criminal court in Truro found out that he regularly tied his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
In a confession, Treise wrote: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court found out that Mrs Randle was killed in her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007 at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Treise had tied her up and her eyes were tied before he carried out sexual actions while her mother was gone to work in a restaurant.
Treise and his wife were divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court found that Mrs Randle, who worked for the National Trust for a great deal of her time, was persecuted by the abuse that she had been made twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said that Mrs Randle, who had been an eager surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "abandoned her life"
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that ended like this: "I used to tie her up and connect her eyes."
"I didn't sexually force her.
I feel responsible for her death. "
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Treise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist and for her victim it must have been terrifying, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Even worse is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended in court if it had not done so. "
He added: "I take note of the impact, according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother, of her actions on her daughter over the years.
Otherwise, she would have been a very promising, successful and happy young woman. "
Officials responsible for lost data are charged
The BBC has learned that the Cabinet official, who had lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June, will be charged in accordance with the "Public Security Act."
The man was seconded from the Ministry of Defense when he lost two extremely confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no evidence of criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action had been a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "You would have thought that this would be dealt with internally at the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be mentioned is charged in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the law, the clause dealing with the safe storage of information.
The Royal Prosecutor recommended that the official be charged by the Metropolitan Police for the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he issued included classified assessments of Al-Qaeda and the capacity of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a secret place.
Housing companies view B & B costs
British housing companies could have a cost of more than 80 million pounds after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government provided 14 billion pounds to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingley's 2.6 million customers.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
The Director-General of the Association of Housing Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "unbearable" that companies and their members should pay.
The 14 billion loan will eventually be repaid if Bradford & Bingley's loans are cancelled.
But interest accrued in the meantime is charged every year to 700 financial companies that accept the deposits.
The financial compensation programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this number.
It is bitter that those institutions that have been cautious are now called upon to take over some of the costs of those institutions that were far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in relation to the deposits it would hold and that the companies would have to pay around 18% of the costs together.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies have to buy 81 million pounds for the first year's interest rates.
Adrian Coles, the Director-General of the Association of Housing Companies, informed the BBC that he believed that this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved cautiously during the real estate upturn are now called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the existence of the records in 1945.
"We will monitor all aspects of this over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members of potentially significant costs."
The interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be due for a full year and this could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are non-shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either by higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk becomes five pence per litre more expensive
The people of Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of his milk by another five pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after a consulting company's investigations have been carried out.
The retailers should decide whether they want to pass the price increase on to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey Milk changed last in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her defenders said that the court refused to have extorted bail on the charge of 50 million Taka ($729.700) by a businessman while she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of several floating charges against them for corruption.
Sheikh Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released at the beginning of this month against bail.
Sheikh Hasina is to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, called for the military-based transition government to give it full freedom.
The correspondents say that although their detention was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear in the context of their release whether they will be able to continue to stay on their feet when they return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers state that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The upper court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's request for bail because it says that it does not have to be granted a deposit because it is already on suspension abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file a complaint against the Supreme Court. "
Her lawyers claim that they need bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
It is expected that Sheikh Hasina will return home after October 17, said an Awami Alliance Party President on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the army-supported transitional government had taken over power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Afraid of the anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan
In the recent anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, almost 200 000 children have not been vaccinated because of the violence associated with the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
The United Nations carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was the case despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or impede the thousands of people in charge of the vaccination.
BskyB loses action in case ITV
BskyB has lost its action against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share of the competing channel ITV.
The Competition Court has ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that the share of BskyBs distorted competition and allowed it to have an unfair influence on the channel ITV.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of the share of ITV by BskyB raised doubts about the independence of ITV, which led the Competition Commission to start an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the communication office Ofcom have opposed the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and excessive measure, in particular because BskyB had announced that it would give up its voting rights.
New investigation in the US Public Prosecutor's Office
The US Attorney General has commissioned a special investigator to deal with the termination of the nine US prosecutors in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of the administrative staff were criticised.
The report was critical of the officials of the White House, legislators and former prosecutor-general Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by the fears that the lawyers had been dropped for political reasons.
The special agent Nora Dannehy is now to clarify whether the officials interviewed during the investigation have lied to the investigators in order to impede the justice.
Serious allegations, including criminal actions, have not been fully investigated or clarified, said General Inspector Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special agent with the authority to force the witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Ministry of Justice removed nine US prosecutors from their offices in December 2006.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the prosecutors were dismissed due to poor work.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged any worse than many of their colleges, which led many observers to consider the cancellations as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the judicial persecution of high-level Republican Congress members, while others had refused to investigate the allegations of election fraud by the Democrats.
US prosecutors are responsible for investigating and following court cases for the government.
They may be released at any time, but may not be withdrawn for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Advocate General Alberto Gonzales, has been under attack for the redundancies and has, in the end, set up his office.
A number of officials from the Ministry of Justice have also quit.
In particular, the report of the inspector-general has been critical of the role of Gonzales by bearing the "main responsibility" for the redundancies, "giving up" its leadership and showing itself in the "exceptionally disinterested" process.
Other officials, including the former Chief Adviser of President Bush Karl Rove, were criticised for the lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song to be honored
The rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored during the music award ceremony "Q Award" for its epic hymn "Bat Out Of Hell."
The singer who will accept his special gold prize in London next week during the award said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which takes nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of Meat Loaf's 1977 album.
"Coldplay" leads the nominations for the award of this year after it has come into the closer selection in four categories.
The chief editor of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said there were some songs that go beyond such materials as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song that was written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that takes almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK as a single in 1979 and has reached number 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years. One of them was an operation in 2003 because of irregular heart beat after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007 he had to cancel concerts due to an acute throat inflammation.
Later it became known that he had a cyst on his vocal tape.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon for sale
New York City has thousands of main roads, alone, side roads and other bypass roads, some of which are famous and others are only comfortable.
However, even for experienced taxi drivers and long-term residents it is difficult to tell where extra place is located, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs from First Street to the north between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an actively used transit road.
There are no street signs.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road plan.
This road still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to repatch Extra Place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques that are expected in the new buildings.
Among the other admirers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short street, simply because it is one of the remains of the past of the house block.
But the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in maintaining them.
During a meeting of the Committee on Land Use of the City Council this month, representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay have drawn up a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
However, the Committee prefers the road to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district responsible in the municipal council. 3.
"Very little space has remained in the possession of the city and we want extra place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offers of how to repair and operate the road, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small road would replast and set up seats, which are intended for, among other things, a café to which the company would like to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was made public for the first time during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a speaker from Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the road, it did not want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this lost alley and make it a public meeting point," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the building protection department, said that it was actually the city's wish to sell the road and stressed that the department's task was to develop the real estate rather than to manage it.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has maintained some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the road got its name in 1802 when a large farm that belonged to Philip Minthorne was divided between its many children and a narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock monument that was closed in 2006, opened to the extra place and the street is probably most known as the backdrop for the photo on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones.
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones who took the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scrap, rags and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling extra place, arguing that this public property, as modest as it is, should continue to be public.
Others have praised extra place as a rarity - a virtually unchanged splinter of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Complaints: A bitter nostalgic view of the dying city"), published part of the talk of the city's history about Extra Place, which was published in the magazine "The New York" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small narrow dead end, which even remains dark during the day and is marked by rugged metal door of the warehouse halls, closed windows and past the rain rings flying week-old newspapers."
With a few exceptions, the road looked just like this recently in one evening.
A rat ran through the back part of the road, not far from the door that used to lead to the CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing business.
Graffiti was on the walls and an empty beer bottle was on the ground not far from a fresh bundle of outsourced newspapers.
Some passers said that they had rarely thought about extra place, but suggested that the road could be a little polished up.
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the attraction of the road in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, moist and disgusting.
The debate on bilingual training: education in English-speaking environments
In this issue of "Education Watch," Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, head of the scientific staff in California studies and head of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs a school selection."
To address the Spanish voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's campaign of election mentions that "the probability of the school being successfully completed by African-American and Spanish students is lower than that of white students" - which is true.
In order to close this performance gap, Obama's educational plan recommends, among other things, a bilingual transition phase in the training for those who first learn English.
However, the question to Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, is contrary to his interest in reducing the distance to school services.
Let's take the example of "Sixth Street Prep," a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of the students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than one third of the students, many of whom have recently been in the country, learn English.
However, in 2008, an amazing 100% of fourth-class students passed the state exam in Mathe at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93% of the children from the fourth year of school were rated as good in the English exam.
This amazing success has been achieved with other methods than those that Obama prefers.
The school Sixth Street places its focus on review and exercise, on constant control of knowledge and a attitude that does not tolerate any exceptions.
The school also practices the approach to training in an English-speaking environment, which is exactly what Obama should be aware of, says the head of the school Linda Mikkel.
This approach places emphasis on the almost exclusive use of the English language in technical education.
Mrs Mikkel, who rejected the idea of bilingual training, said to me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had just come from Mexico. 12 months later, one would be able to enter the classroom and not recognize it.
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the Sixth Street Prep as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English students?
The school's services would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational positions within its own party (the national education associations have long supported the idea of bilingual training) and its own consistent support for bilingual training make predictions about Obama's response uncertain.
While agreeing to the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the subject by noting that people should stop worrying about the legislation aimed at "only English."
Instead, he said, "I want you to make sure your child can have Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the performance gap, he should take careful account of educational models that work instead of despising and trivialising them.
Oil prices are falling as a result of renewed fears about the economy
The oil price on Monday has fallen strongly due to the fears that even the American rescue plan for the financial markets could not be enough to revive the economy.
The oil futures on the New York trade fair fell by 7 percent in the morning session to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, the price has fallen by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, the goods markets have been shaken by both the financial turbulence on Wall Street and strong cyclones in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices reached their peak in July of $145.29 per barrel, this month they fell to almost $90 per barrel, then again, as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets, to rise.
On Monday, investors have been worried again, even though Congress representatives had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan that should be the biggest in history on the weekend.
This message was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was far from complete.
In the first last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government announcement on Monday, the Citigroup is to buy up the banking business of Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclay's Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place on the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems that it has not been possible to revive the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to continue to fall.
German Bank analysts have written in a communication to investors that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become very uncertain.
We believe they will continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of the goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the US virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China."
The Bank's analysts have corrected their expectations for oil consumption as a result of weak economic growth for the coming year and reduced their forecasts for the oil and gas price for 2009 by 20%.
Team record set up by series in the second quarter
Internal Defender Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen everything after he'd been in the jet jersey more than anyone in the last eight and a half years.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter in which the jets turned a result-less game into a triumph.
"I've never seen anything like it," said Ellis.
After a slumped game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which was in line with the bad weather, the second quarter began.
But when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, this marked the perfect start to an afternoon when their developing cooperation made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this neighborhood for two more touchdowns that once slipped out as an external defender and the other time 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I didn't make a special effort," says Coles about the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a superplayer.
Our vote has voted no matter what people think. "
While Favre and Coles were playing catch, the defense quarterback took Kurt Warner apart.

Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and caught him.
Linebacker David Bowens then made a loss of Warner.
The last loss of ball, forced by Bowens, was probably the most crazy.
The Cardinals had taken the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets took the ball back and Jay Feely turned a 20-yard shot into a 34-0 lead.
These were most of the points the Jets had ever achieved in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the madness Erik Mangini, the coach of the jets, answered "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
To the answers both, because the jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without reaching a single one, Mangini said: "Believe me, I have enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points have been achieved in a short time. "
Refreshed Gebrselassie beats his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has again shown why some think he is the best long-distance runner of all time after he broke his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first person to make the 42.2 km track in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2: 03: 59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2: 04: 26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved in Berlin last year.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus established his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has reached at least one world title or a world record on every track from one kilometre to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie left the Olympic Marathon in Beijing out of fear, which may have been exaggerated after that, that air pollution could exacerbate its asthma problems.
Instead, he has signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - in the case of the sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the target - gebrselassie has won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since the long-range train runs such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have changed, the record time for marathon has fallen by more than 2 minutes in the last 10 years, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2: 06: 05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had had cramps in his Wade two weeks ago and therefore could not train for a week.
Apparently, he was refreshed after a break and didn't come back rusty.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I resumed the training a week ago and had some concerns today, but in the end something great. "
He was criticised for this - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from East Africa - that he overorchestrated his races, generally avoiding many world-best marathon stars, relying too much on the race leaders as if it were a railway race, and putting world record over the competition.
But this criticism is hardly damaging to the size of gebrselassies as a long-distance runner.
Guided by four Kenians on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the centre of the line in 1: 02: 04.
Two elite people from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi have continued to challenge the war after the tempomakers had failed.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie took his last step to separate himself from Kwambai, who arrived second in 2: 05: 36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi was third in 2: 07: 48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed a significant year by showing at 2: 19: 19 the seventh fastest result of all time.
The world record of 2: 15: 25 holds Paul Radcliff from the UK.
Last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2: 24: 14.
She missed the Beijing games because of problems described as back injury. However, she has recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She has planned her course in a skilful way by letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners pass, but overtook it after 30 kilometres.
Askale Tata Magarsa from Ethiopia became second in 2: 21: 31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived as third in 2: 25: 01.
The pride and the straits in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the explosions of the leisure parks within the area of Orlando, a few miles from the glittering, loud and gigantic drive, lies a quiet city in which the pride and complications of African-American culture come to light.
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the home town of Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three cricket places, 300 brown hides, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guava, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it is a pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet the city which it describes - and which made it a tourist destination by taking it to the Florida guide, which was produced at the time of depression by the Federal Writer Project - is and remains in many respects a place of the very special kind.
Eatonville is as independent, strong and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he does not know what he is missing."
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidacy, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open talk about racial relations, many of us here continue to be tired of being watched by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our story is told," says Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and a member of the community of the oldest church in the city.
It has to be true. "
Eatonville was defined for a long time as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of almost 2,400 inhabitants, where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is, on the one hand, a stronghold of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural south, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that people here are both proud and aware.
And so the concerns about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as all of them call here Hurston.
She introduced her home city to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in Mundart, like "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973).
Five paragraphs in the Floridari guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that leads through the often-forgotten centre of Floridas, to the locations of black history and human drama.
He was the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then turned to private affairs.
"From the street to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-white-painted modern school, with its well-maintained gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller always cares about, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new man of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of any kind and whatever-always fits to hours."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
"Zora described things as they were," said the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who immortalized Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about their beauty, which were full of sexual allusions.
She added, "Some people didn't like this."
One still remembers here Hurtson as a lively eccentric who regularly returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston got used to the city, she did this most of the time without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and clothed with pants, in a city that even today imagines something on her venerable style of clothing.
According to Mr. Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, while many of them despised.
"People were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added, as he swooped in his chair, on a back-facing terrace that looks at the Sabelia Lake, where Hurston was most likely baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were taken away.
Together with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a time-woman Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived, in an anonymous grave.
In Eatonville there was no great memorial, no public readings in the big style.
"I do not think they have understood their contribution in the world or their heritage in the least," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbow," a biography about Hurston, published in 2003.
The turn came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-lane highway through the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-lane main road of the municipality.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed Highway 4 through the western outskirts of the city.
The proposal was submitted when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult phase in his history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial abuse brought hatred to the Community.
"During this time a lot of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff at the people sitting away," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even one woman who was killed in the process.
They threw a watermelon out of the car. "
In 1955, Hurston questioned in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel the request of the Supreme Court to force integration by calling its decision in the Brown case against the school council "insulting rather than respecting my race."
People today say that although the abolition of racial segregation was positive in some respects, it weakened the group's cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being embraced - I remember - they embraced their teacher in the morning and they embraced their teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the non-profit group for the protection of the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for so long, she added until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"They did not embrace his white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean there is a cultural divide," said Mrs Nathiri.
However, citizens' rights have helped to create space for further Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists who have gone beyond prejudices, as they did, with positive self-confidence and statements such as: "How can anyone refuse the joy of my society!
I don't understand. "
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker made his way to Hurston's nameless grave and began to fight for the revival of her glory.
Five years later, a much-praised Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found in the book rules, and again made it part of the American literature canon.
The road project came exactly at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the light of the public.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The municipality began planning a Hurston festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the motorway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its street plans.
"The plans of a five-lane road have brought the city to life, accelerated it at top speed, raised real citizens' pride," said Mrs Nathiri.
Mrs Boyd expressed it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the road project has contributed to a change in the city's self-image.
There were more and more arrivals, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church here since 1993, and local people began to revalue the past.
Eatonville was included in the national historical register in 1998.
A new one-story library (of course named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a special feature in Florida: only 6 miles from the city centre of Orlando can sometimes feel like a backstreet in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It is 90% black today.)
Outstanding people looking for the history of Eatonville and its significance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, prior approval is necessary and certain things - like the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, which was painted by a white man and is a black man in the field work - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs Jones, a brave, confident teacher with a preference for dark red, are still afraid that her hidden community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time as the Hurston Festival became bigger, an increased degree of home pride was born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her whole race: beautiful, with all his problems, neither worse nor better and as proud, creative and diligent, silly and mixed like any other race and population group in America.
It is the sincere love of this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who is going to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city administration or the police who, according to him, might need some help.
And even the younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville properly.
"Most people who only go through here will think," Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others, "said Alondra Kenon the other day on a Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at your story for a moment, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York, they speak fluent financial Latin.
At first sight, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the newspapers and the huge TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't even notice they're in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoe-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York, have had the worst day of horror since the 1929 stock exchange crash.
The suppliers are still pushing the metal teas along sidewalks with loud flaps and transport tablets loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos are still sneaking between apartments, like human packers loaded with around 50 T-shirts that hang on a yoke-like pole on their shoulders.
Office staff are still waiting for their breakfast bagels on their own on the rise and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a day between 4: 00 and 7: 00 on a week.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon due to all the talk of the world's end.
Although I had decided to put my duty course on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase stem branch, there were already about 20 people in line.
Not to the money switches to pick up or pay up money, but to the customer service switch where regular customers order checkbooks, ask tourists for the way to the Macy's department store and where new customers open accounts.
Most of them before me, so I later learned from Starr, my "personal bank employee with a license," stood for the same reason as I was a snake.
In contrast to me, however, they had already taken away their savings from smaller banks, in places from which they commuted, like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken away money from so-called Thrifts (a little similar to a building savings bank), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in a state, and said they treat their customers like family.
Last year, 15 of these banks went quiet and quiet.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion of assets, went home in bankruptcy management and as last Friday New York drove home for the weekend, Wachovia, another bank with savings worth $440 billion, was looking for a saving buyer.
In the fear of another collapse, the office and shop staff who were standing before me brought their bars to a bank that is considered a safe port, a bank responsible for most of the rescue purchases on Wall Street.
In the last few weeks, quite normal New Yorkers have been able to make a run for money.
A woman who was on the phone in my Chinese stock market, with so much familiarity, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt and their mailed-out CEO Dick Fuld, as if she were blasphemy about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my residence block, has come from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food supply.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds" she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not taking any more risks."
Muslemic graves slandered while right-wing in Austria
Heinz-Christian Striche, a left-wing judge of the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang, will take part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008 to represent the organization "Cities against Islamisation."
They carry signs in the style of traffic marks on which a mosque is depicted, crossed with a red line.
The police accuse right-wing extremists of the grave in a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend at which extremely right-wing parties have significant profits in the country's parliamentary election.
On the night of Friday this morning, more than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Graveyard in Traun near Linz in a, according to the police, organized action.
The perpetrators were spying Jewish symbols like the David Stern on some of the graves, but criminal officials think this is an attempt to conceal the motive of the extremists driven by hatred on Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesperson of the local Islamic community said she was "deeply shocked" about the news of the disobedience of the grave, which took place when the religious month of the Muslim Ramadan endured the end.
At the same time, a round of conscience research is in progress in Austria after the country slid to the right in yesterday's parliamentary election.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties who received almost 30% of the votes, were in favour of a strict anti-immigrant law and some of their voting rights were criticised by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Striche, President of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, was in favour of a ban on head-cloths and burkas and even made his dislike against food that is generally associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets with the argument that these political symbols are a continuous Islamisation of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the election and which claim that the extreme rights of the country's strongest political bloc are, indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
International travel barrier for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star who has been convicted of the sexual abuse of children, was banned from travelling to France and Spain.
The judges set up a six-month lock on Glitter after informing the authorities in charge of the fact that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
The Kent police were granted to impose an international travel ban last Thursday after presenting evidence to the judges of glitter's criminal charges for the sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
EIn spokesman of the Court of Justice said: "On Thursday 25 September, the police requested Kent to the Ashford District Court to prevent foreign travel from Mr Paul Glad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not personally present. "
As required by the register of sexual offenders, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his scheduled departure.
Failure to notify authorities could lead to a 5-year prison sentence.
The Kent police said it wouldn't discuss individual cases or glitter's possible whereabouts in the country.
A speaker from Kent's police unit said, "The Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"We believe it is easier to control someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the primary concern of the Kent police to protect the inhabitants of Kents and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sexual offenders in the country to minimise any risk that might exist to the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter was sent to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through the passport control and he flew to Hong Kong for something.
The Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officers insisted that he return to Britain.
Finally, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on August 22, and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully requested permission to request that he register as a sexual offender.
Glitter was previously detained in the United Kingdom for 4 months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, Jacqui Smith, was calmed down and satisfied that Glitter was stopped from travelling to France and Spain.
"I receive the master behind the stage to hold his character," Günter Brauer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no rugs, no costumes for the show.
The nature of the great Flamencotanzer, who renounce concentration and devote themselves to interpretation to get a relaxed look as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, the artist
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into those moments that are foreign to the public, I know when I can find typical gestures for personality, the depth of a stolen look or expression of the hands that are concerned because they will not enter the stage.
In his project 'Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents a series of theatrical works on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this page he was still little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of the flame code representation at different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the program of the month of photography of the Flamenco, 'reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which is becoming ever greater from day to day,' explains the artist and makes it clear that 'Flamenco-people' can be any person, but if you look at the photos, the viewer will notice that there are no typical pictures of artists on the stage.
Very normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to communicate on stage passion, sadness, joy and thus to move the audience.
To hold on to the personality of these artists, you don't have to take pictures on the stage.
Their personality and character is in their hearts.
What was interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the largest flame comrades with the camera. '
Bauer, inspired by the 'Cante de las Minas' festival, made a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images were created that remind of classical photography.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, giving the image the modernity and idea as the Bauer Flamenco understands: 'Music with traditional roots, which changes and surprises every day'.
These are not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental play in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, which seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something that becomes visible in the form of hearing, of being, is and was the firm goal of this work, which will be presented in the gallery of El Fotómata in the next time.
Known personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the close selection of almost seventy artists who have been photographed.
The project became an anthology of the Flamencos and will soon appear as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portraits led him to take up this idea again two years ago and to realize it as' the portraits of the veterans of sport '(' SportART project ').
Although the concepts of the project 'Flamenco-people' are different, I very much like to photograph people, to get to know them and to put me in their state of life, whether for a short moment or a longer time.
I think that in the field of photography, the portrait is the most difficult species.
You meet or you meet people, people you don't know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a picture.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas. '
The collection of the portraits of the Flamencos of today, entitled 'Flamenco-people', is exhibited in the gallery of the El Fotómata, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street of la Alameda de Hércules. You can visit the exhibition until October 16.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he's just writing is "a great cowardice."
He does not yet know where the action of the novel takes place and what it is about, but, Mario Vargas Llosa is constantly trying to advance the project he is working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel Prize winner admitted that the project he is working with is' a great boldness' and 'everything indicates that he does not have to write the novel'.
'If I were made up, I would not have done it, but I will do it and hope to end the novel eventually ', so he closed his participation in the festival where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days he has seen hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of 'La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, the premium of the festival Hay Festival and to which most of the people present give their voice, is compared to the old edition of 'Our mutual friend' and can be seen in the theatre Juan Bravo.
He was presented by Félix Romeo and found that he had an audience in front of him who saw that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, was not given enough time to go through everything again: how his vocation to literature was born, which is from 'extraordinary adventurous', from 'joy of reading' and from 'more to experience' than 'before'; how he writes and 'discipline' to supplement 'the lack of inspiration', his intense work with documentaries, numerous corrections and his works, which he is based on the "Dukro 'and his stories, which are the" Dukro'.
The Hispanic American novelist admitted that there is' no way 'to measure and how to know if books change life,' but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience ', said Vargas Llosa, who claims that it is' effects' and 'brings people more apart', so I asked the writers' not to leave themselves to ease 'and' take responsibility 'for his vocation'.
At the festival in Pozoblanco the weather did not play with: bullfighting fell out in part.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the place was in bad condition, the bullfight with which the festival was to be completed in Pozoblanco was moved to yesterday morning.
The organizer, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, has decided to postpone the bullfight.
Thus the festival was exposed to the unsteady weather, which was why two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it was raining, which was why the second planned bullfight could not be celebrated.
The group of the Matadore consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullfighting arena.
So there was only a party on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and triumphed, after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which he had succeeded more by galoppiers than by his bullfighting art.
And even worse was El July, who went through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without glory.
After he had fought so badly, a large part of the audience responded in his second fight with boo calls.
In Álava two people wanted to avoid the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow, five minutes before 10: 00.
Traffic control in Ertzaintza, in the urban area of Armiñon (Álava).
Two police officers asked the drivers of the car to stop, and they took the escape.
It looked like they didn't have to stop loading more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police followed her and arrested one of the drivers, the man who was 28 years old, known as A. A. J., as reported by the Ministry of the Interior of the Basque State.
The person arrested was accused of drug trafficking and forgery of official documents.
The incident occurred when the transport police officers in the Álava region had already completed the traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the city area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to avoid the control.
The police started the persecution until the car stopped at the edge after a few kilometres. At the moment, the drivers got out of the car to escape to a forest area via a country road.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza finally picked up one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug traffickers transported 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was confiscated by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later led to the precise laboratory analysis and to the weighing of the bundles to other police services.
In addition, the officials found that the label was' double ', so it was not in line with the label given in the car documents, and therefore a further arrest was made for the falsification of official documents.
The police in the city of Ertzaintza are continuing the investigation in order to arrest the second suspect who, as mentioned above, was able to escape, but also to determine the origin of the drugs seized.
The arrested 28-year-old A. A. J. was brought to a police station for questioning. He will be brought to the court in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Lockbear was arrested for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
The actress Heather Lockbear, who is known for the role of Amanda in the "Melrose Place" series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
A witness had observed how she tried to get out of her parking lot in Montecito in a rather strange way, reported the California traffic police spokesman to the magazine 'People'.
The witness told us in detail that Lockbear 'pushed through and made a lot of noise after 16: 30, trying to move her car back or forward out of the parking lot, and when she went backwards, she caught herself on her sunglasses a few times.'
A little later, the witness, who had probably not known the actress at first, saw that Lockbear stopped on a nearby street and got out of the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she had "fear for Locklears' life.
When the police strike came, they found the actress sitting in their car, which was on the street and thus blocked the traffic.
'She seemed to be unoriented ', so they brought the police to a special drug and alcohol center to take a test.
According to a police speaker, the actress showed himself cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was excluded from the first moment. 'The first observations of the officials following, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug', said the speaker.
Lockbear was arrested under the suspicion of driving under the influence of an indefinite substance that could not be determined and brought to a local detention facility by 7: 00.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released from the Arizona clinic after treatment, where she was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Federation of the United Left be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and United Left Members, has today assured that the regional education association will be the one to make the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sport of the City Hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who had resigned last week after he was accused of doing business with family members.
'In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who has to take responsibility for it ', Llamazares pointed out the way in which the party has to deal with the one that has so far been a city council in the Municipality of Seville.
However, the president of the VL defended the need for 'transparency' in the possible investigation of the regulatory violations that Silva may have started: 'The VL always insisted that such cases should be given the maximum transparency'.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that education has' a strict ethical code for all public offices'.
Sangre de mayo: Gucci's Held Book
Inspired by 'Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in 'Sangre de mayo' represents the revised version of the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French. This is an admirable film in cinemography, with about 15 million euros of investment for the filming.
In this way, the Cineast has tried to 'present a lot of personalities and social analysis', which he has always admired in the works of the famous novelist, today Carci explained at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of actors.
'Sangre de mayo 'with a film length of more than two and a half hours, is presented in cinemas this Friday and later on the channel Telemadrid is shown as a four-hour mini-series.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of the literature of Galdós, assures that thanks to this work his' childhood dream 'was fulfilled. This is due to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago by the autonomous community of Madrid to make a memorial film for the second century celebration in Madrid on 2 November. Especially because the story is based on' Episodes Nacionales', the mission was accepted.
The total contribution of 15 million made by the autonomous community of Madrid for filming, as he added, offers the 'unique possibility' with the help of decorations and corresponding clothing the image of 'confused Spain, who chose the wrong leader for the fight because the people had been put back by the struggle for independence and under the rule of the Ferdinand of VII'.
However, the Cineast regrets that it was not possible to expect financing like 'Alatriste' or 'Los fantamas de Goya' (twice as high as' Sangre de mayo '), so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with which Garci worked almost all his career together, could not be shot.
For this reason, Gucci, who was also film director in 'Volver a empezar', has been involved in his usual work: he set himself on the stage to the actors with whom you have to rehearse before you start shooting and for those who had not made casting, he appeared 'humiliating' and giving respect 'part of the work of the film director is to provide help in the theatre and cinema, to know what is happening in the cinema industry in which you work.'
Many actors he meets in 'Sangre de mayo' must repeat in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Gucci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he has won one), is of the opinion that none of the three candidates who represent Spain in front of the Academy of Hollywood this year is a young generation of Spanish film. Neither 'Sangre de mayo', nor 'Siete mesas de billar francés' and, finally, not the selected film 'Los girasoles ciegos'.
For this film, Garci does not expect any awards.
"At the beginning you think you're working for the offspring, later you notice that it's only for your own good, and now you're happy when you've produced a movie," explains Garci after more than 30 years of work.
Isabel Bayón calls back the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville adore a dancer who also came from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother of Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first women to fight for the emancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian, and was in favour of the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left her mark in the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the time between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this role to me, which seemed impossible to me."
'We are not trying to tell about her life, without her esprit, 'said the Flamencotanzerin.
Your dance grounds have helped me a lot in Flamenco.
"The dance of the butterfly" was like Guajira, for example, or "the dance of the snake" like Tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I was told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic area ', she says.
The production expects two extraordinary works: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel at one of her ideas, as he did in 'La puerta abierta'; and with Flamenco-master Matilde Coral, who wanted to work with one of her ex-students for the time being.
'Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I'm happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored. '
The production also takes place with musical composition and the guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the song of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he 'takes over the role of the director of the artists who were Divas, in whom he always falls in love.'
In this work, we also talk in a certain way about this woman's life, which has become known in places as far as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, although she has normally lived in London.
"I wanted to recall her, because I think she is one of the women who has an enormous influence on a particular era and whose works today no longer have any value for her," says Bayón.
The performance takes place at the Lope de Vega theatre at 20: 30 today.
The publication of the book 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the triennial
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married in 1916, offers a corresponding atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the 'Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The aim is to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the death of the two.
The 'Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' will be completed with the new edition of this work, with the International Congress, which will take place in New York, with the restoration of the Museum of the House of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the 'Juan Ramón Jiménez:' Aquel chopo de luz ', which was opened in May and after which it was in different places in Andalusia, now reached New York and is presented in the course of the international congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and work of the Andalusian world poet known.
The United States can not imagine itself well without Paul Newman
'Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them. "
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in 'Sensation reporter', and from the then-ruling idea of American cinema, which was abandoned, came from all of America to Newman with his enthusiastic idea and followed her.
Look what it cost him to give him the Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
But it was a big blow to everyone.
"What one sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend," said Robert Redford weeping, "my life and my country were the greatest tribulations of his life."
No one was afraid to make a fool of themselves or to overdo it.
As a 'father' of the cinema and the fatherland, he died in a sad moment in which there is fear of terrorists and of the collapse of the market, in which the American self-esteem that has been lost is on the hopeless search for reasons to get dignity back.
If in this hard time, without virtue, only a few people can be admired, you don't necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all of them, he was a sort of a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as well as various losses: from the foundation, which committed itself to the fight against drugs and was founded in honor of his son from the first marriage, who died of overdose, up to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All this is a gift for the country in which it took a lot of effort to fight against a deadly food culture.
A wide wave of surprise is about to take home-high over Hollywood without taking into account nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one person died, but the whole era.
The English Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar winner, said that working with Newman was no more or no less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
'We have left the greatest of us all, 'said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who are afraid to live today as Paul Newman lived: to get high demands on justice, to lead a responsible private life, far from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there's someone who's trying, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He divorced once and was married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, who he was faithful to, although there were certainly many possibilities not to be.
'Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have filet at home? 'he often yelled at himself.
In heaven he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
'Of all the great roles he played, he was not as proud of any of those of the faithful spouse, of the loving father, of the attentive grandfather and of the philanthropist, 'they say.
For the Olympic Games, the streets in Madrid are inadequate.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organize some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we prepared for this?
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not true!
It was called the perfect road, and according to my assessment, it was the worst road with everything there was.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense, if you were to pay attention to the evaluation and I could check it out, that would clearly not have been the case.
But let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticket pick that allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem bad to me either, but if they let you go, they should give you everything (including chip to avoid the congestion on the road).
Well, I'm not.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that is to go there only) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in the size 'S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it that after the crisis was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts from less material?
All right, things like this are a little thing compared to the days on the street.
Besides that you have to go very early to get the chip, there's already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, besides, you have to leave the backpack.
The waiting took more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11 000 people are expected.
Finally, as it was to be expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks to it, even if it had been successful, but it would be more difficult to get back.
In addition, in this 40-minute waiting period it looked like rain, so there was an attempt to organize a popular uprising and to rob the house.
I think tomorrow, some 500 people will have pneumonia and some like me will not even appear in time for the classification because of this chip I got, I can think that the output was misstamped.
Of course, if I was asked about a perfect road, I would never think of this road.
So I think we're gonna dream about a city that's well prepared for the Olympic Games.
Microsoft in search of a (virtual) receptionist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference', organized by MIT, Microsoft has presented the progress of the new image identification system and the human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, but which is able to do some primitive tasks, such as order a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft this is a route planner to move on the company's campus). The system respects what it hears during the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face recognition system, this' receptionist 'can see how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also include those present after the discussions in the groups.
In the presentation video 'the receptionist' notes a third person, but she understands that this person is not a member of the group that talks to her, and that there is no company employee either.
She asks if the person here wants to visit someone and answers that she will listen soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
That is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week, they were talking very superficial about Microsoft's strategy change.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many integrated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling them with the commercial waste, they would work five times faster.
Everything is only a finding, considering that Microsoft added some function and 'extras' in Windows versions.
The change of direction is worth
The Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, that was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Sent by a lot of people to point out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an essential part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to work at the same time.
The operating system meets the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to communicating something to his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of his' death ', not as an absolute but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system each time, more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run the Firefox, the Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time surfing than in the 'window' environment.
What is the use of half of existing applications in the computer?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
It's easier, not too much, less complicated.
The interest of microsofts is more to integrate its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need this, without a doubt. I bring a little example of this.
I took the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
A sign is attached to the refresher's vending machine: 'Your search. Our future'. It prints out a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that the 66% of employees in Microsoft, Google used to search the network.
By the way, last week was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the opportunity to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the mark at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso had it on in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in 'Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in 'The Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it is part of a well-built pastor's clothing.
When we start to list the countless star performances, we can go back to the image of a very powerful man, with a sharp beard, who had raised heavy weights in a hiking circus.
Basically, this is a typical male t-shirt made of cotton, poor and waisted.
The English-speaking people call it 'tank'. However, Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles surpasses all other brands.
First, because of his great name, although it is called 'Marcel' in the narrow circle. The legend tells that the name creation is connected to sport and comes from the Boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel 'overlooks everyone because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive unisex cut and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (hardly recognizable) that these T-shirts have as detail on the neck cut.
And attention, the Belgian company not only focuses on the production of 'tanks'.
They also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, cardigan and cashmere, cotton pants, T-shirts with stripes, babies, mini shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is very bad to use them as undergarments.
You're very charming.
"I want to be a young mother; I don't worry about the candidate."
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is petite, but full of joy of life.
At the moment, the brothers and sisters of Gruz take their new business in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, then moved to it and also made the presentation of the most important premiums in fashion that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Merciful and shy, a short-distance winner.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn / winter season that my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I also visited the presentation of the second edition of 'Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in the dinner in Valentine's honor.
A very intensive working time, which is at the same time exciting.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I am fascinated by the cinema of the 50's and 60's; there are many ideas.
I like to go through a city and watch women dress up, combine their clothes, I do that a lot.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything meets in one and these areas have a lot of common ground.
Since I was little, I was excited about the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother's to get into my aunt's clothes and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to a leisure park.
Even later, as a dancer, I always tried to watch out for the clothes.
You know, we dancers like to have our own style in class and in the rehearsals to look in the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you put yourself in the real role of the performer.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, much respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
You've recently become 30, haven't you been in a crisis?
Oh, that's right.
I feel better than ever, than 30 years old, I feel good.
I think the woman is getting mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological watch.
I've done the things I've been trying to do since I was little, and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking of becoming a mother, aren't you?
For a long time I have known that I will be a mother, because that is what my body requires, and I also want to be a young mother; I do not want to miss that.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
I will give my child great happiness and raise it with a lot of love.
As far as film art is concerned, you keep in mind the work you took part in and the last year were shot.
That is exactly the way it is and I would like them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theatre, am very impatient and restless and wants to have everything at once, which, of course, cannot be right away.
I very much wish that 'La última hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo' will be performed for the first time.
Let's see how you like them
A few days ago, you showed up on the road with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say that.
It's not like I was going on the road to modeling.
Naomi Campbell, who I have known for some time, has just called me and invited me to London to take part in a parade for the charity event of her organization 'Women for a better world' and the clothes we show. I know that two clothes from our collection were auctioned for Mango to collect the money for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
A lot of things are being told about her, and I, as the one she knows, would tell you they're not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which it is involved.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this great thing, but when she comes and asks me to make a stand, I will do the same.
To support women in the Third World, which is also necessary.
The drivers, who can be lost due to the alcohol level, will have to install the 'Alcolock'.
The Authority orders that the driver, who had three official penalties for the level of alcohol, install this system in his car, which prohibits him from starting the car in the drunk state. If he is alcoholic, the car does not start.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the General Prosecutor, according to which it is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The purpose is to resocialize the driver, which is why he is given a course to retrain the traffic behaviour.
The Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for Safety of Automobiles will also participate in this, in addition to the General Prosecutor's Office, according to experience.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of the drivers, who were more than once shown for driving under alcohol influence, were driving again.
The 'alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the air emitted and prevents car start when the driver has made an alcohol test; or if an alcohol concentration is found higher than allowed.
It costs more than EUR 1 000, the costs are borne by the person who imposed the penalty.
In this context, a study carried out in the US in 2007 has shown that cars equipped with these devices are already preventing up to 65% of the regulatory infringements in the first year following its introduction.
In Spain, 115 lives could be saved each year.
The measure is limited to the administrative sanctions for two reasons: to take this approach before it becomes a crime.
And in order to facilitate its implementation, a legal reform can be implemented in the ordinary way, and yet a reform of the basic law is required for the law enforcement process.
The device is still available in the Spanish markets, not in any business, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
The House of Representatives will vote tomorrow because of the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 5: 40 p.m., at the time provided for by the programme, next to the President's hangar of Benito Juárez de México DF airport, the Spanish Air Force plane landed with the Prince and Princess of Asturias.
The sun went down, but its rays were still forced to use the hand as a umbrella to see the royal couple who got out of the plane.
Directly on the Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A few hours before, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Prince and the Princess of Asturias visited the city to formalize the official journey.
- Ah, very good, so, there's no way to take people at the airport at this time of the day.
No, she's the Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and the Princess of Asturias are and know the importance of the journey.
There are many who are waiting in the hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, including military protection from 27 Navy soldiers who give honour.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long hair weaned by the wind, without ordinary 'peep-toes', may have been told that it is expected to be a thunderstorm in DF.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official follow-up is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, she is waiting for a Mexican TV reporter who likes to make jokes.
The best premium of fashion
There was probably no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no significantly excellent fashion designer and bonvivant than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition 'el Bóton-Mango Fashion Awards' for the promotion and international increase of young fashion talents.
This is awarded with a money price of 300 000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings yesterday in the mango store window at Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost wept because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and has recently been opened. It offers a sales area of 1 335 m ².
The largest business is in London.
So many events have happened that are connected to the fact that you want to thank the fashion designer Valentino for his jury presidency at the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken by the pain, because his brother died recently, was tearing up. He dressed the suit of the fashion house and wearing some of the jewelry of ELAH that were breathtaking. He held himself at the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, in his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the Mango house, welcomed the guests and was such a cavalier, so that he ended up with the Baron of Rotschild without a jacket, because they borrowed the ladies from Jackets.
Mónica Cruz, in a hurry to the business and had a pants and a shirt that she herself modeled, and at dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. In a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a room for ballet samples, so she got excited, remembered the old times, grabbed a rod and made a kind of 'grand pie'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the premises of the palace, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a person who always has a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who has asked in advance to have a room with no smells after his arrival (with his own bed lacquers and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris.
The stars under the star sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Council against stress
There is not a thousand, but one more way to forget chaotic and rapid everyday life.
And if there are few, they are all gathered in a book that says how to relax. The book comes into the bookshops on September 30.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7: 00 in the morning, but even worse is the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that the current life requires.
The office is called the tension and the computers that lead to the back pain.
The stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is not one and not two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of how to turn off the world of work.
The number increases, however, no more and no less than until 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott in the book represents the whole list of possibilities that are adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called '1001 possibilities to relax' and so the rest that the book conveys comes into the bookshops of the publication Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If you think that it is impossible to achieve peace in the areas such as work, by means of personal contacts, this manual disagrees with such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered to stay in contact with nature or to propose the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your veins is no longer high to restore balance of the body and the stress has become a problem, the moment has come to sit on the sofa, turn the brain off and focus on reading.
Talking in the sleep
Some children speak at night
I mean not those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, at best you will be scared, but in reality it has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disorder called speaking in sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and young people.
I'm sure more than one of you was told you were talking at night.
This phenomenon may occur occasionally (once in life, for example, during the high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can't remember anything.
There is no reason to cause this phenomenon.
Frequently, relationships with other phenomena in sleep are sought, such as nightmares, panic fear at night, Enuresis noctura (bedwetlands at night), talking in sleep, but there is no reason for that.
As we have mentioned before, it may be due to very high levels of fiber, stress or overload.
In any case, this is a little explored phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It can be that you speak, whisper, whisper, or it can be quite the opposite (screaming, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the statement is very intense, it is recommended that the child be monitored and consulted with a specialist to check whether there is a problem that causes fear and thus results.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, whether it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with the sleep apnoea or with the stress).
What you can do is to carry out a series of simple prevention measures:
Try not to provoke the child before sleeping.
So, a quiet game for the child to choose and avoid stressful TV programs that are terrible and something too wild.
In the nervous children who are recommended to relax, relaxation methods can be used to help them get a certain inner rest.
It helps the child to sleep quietly.
When speaking occurs in sleep, try to keep quiet.
Remember that it's harmless for the child and the next day it won't remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will tear it out of your sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rest.
Remember, if it is frightening after a couple of apparitions, it is recommended to be advised or to find out what reason the child has for fear.
If they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child does not put pressure on to conduct a hearing and get more information.
So you won't be able to achieve anything, because when the child is asleep, it is unconscious and can't think about it.
Besides, you'll hear what it says, but you won't know what it's dreaming about, and why it says that, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe, don't tell the kid you hear that at night and know his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
It causes a lot of fear.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's a moment that only takes a few minutes.
Illhuizen... at last
After a long thirst, Illhäuser is finally on the field again on a success course.
Without a great effort, the yellow black people were able to win the game, and they were able to implement one of them.
The pace of this encounter, at which the attackers had difficulty showing their skills, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose distance shot just passed by the angle, Illhäuser was supposed to dominate the game with ease, and it was alternately only possible to get a distance flick with a distance shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the foot tip to challenge Denmark's defence.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field and only let the lively Riahi through at the top of the storm.
The start of the second half should be decisive with two gate opportunities, first fought by Riahi and Temporale, and then with the first gate for the Illhäuser by Marais, who was just right to take a ball again, which had been rejected in a first attempt by Diebold.
But the illeusian goalkeeper should not be able to enjoy his luck for long and be sent to the bank about 12 minutes later, so his team mates had to continue to play in numbers.
Denmark, however, did not take advantage of this and did not face any major problems to an illaesian elf, which only withdrew a little to 'compress' their defence, except in the very last seconds of the game in which the ball passed very close to the latte after a big mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before he goes to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a trip to Brittany.
In view of the determined attitude of the fishermen who blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to come to the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives there.
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive spirit' and hope that he will come up with 'concrete proposals'.
The President's visit will take place at the same time as a General Assembly of the Crisis Committee, set up by the Breton fishermen, to implement measures in view of the extreme increase in the price of diesel, which has reached a record value of over 1.14 euros per litre on average.
According to the press speaker of the Elyséepalast David Martinon ', the President will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies become competitive again, and to ensure the conditions of employment and the payment of seafarers.'
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with determination.
On Tuesday morning they led in the Morbihan and Calvado's protest march, which caused congestion of almost ten kilometres in length.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not stop.
The Quiberon peninsula was bounded by a barrier.
Already on Monday, the seafarers expressed their determination by burning tyres and pallets before the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient from the early morning, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the Channel of arms, such as Sables d'Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fish carts did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manoeuvres of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the important total refinery in Donges in the evening.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the course of the meeting in the Ministry on Wednesday before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and on its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Brittany fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the national fisheries committee who did not support their movement.
'The strike will continue 'because' the fishermen will not give up 'and' do not want to go to Paris', for example, Liliane Cariou, President of the Lorient Fisheries Committee announced.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost the litre about 50 cents, but they think that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
The unforgettable actor from 'Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 from the consequences of cancer in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes, were the first to say goodbye to the film legend and dedicated actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer holds its 2008 delivery forecasts
This year, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered, despite the threat of recession, to be a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, holds its supply forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, confirmed its President, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer supplied 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes much from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the order of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider issuing more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times, the insurer American International Group, which was financially supported by the American Monetary Authority, is considering the issue of more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that has been advanced to it.
AIG is ready to deal with the sale of a large part of its business, beyond its international life insurance and pension provision in the United States.
According to the FT, the board of directors of the AIG met Sunday evening to check possible sales.
No confirmation could be obtained from the AIG.
The assets from which AIG might be separated include its aircraft leasing branch International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% share of the reinsurance company Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and investment in private equity, the FT further explains.
As regards these sales, no final decision has been taken, the FT continues.
AIG must make sales as soon as possible to repay the loans over 85 billion that the Federal Reserve has granted to it, even at the risk that the US authorities will receive 80% of their capital and the current shareholders will be lost to the same extent.
Analysis of Historical Paris of the meeting Historical morning meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday, after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to save the banks, a historical case of the courses: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss of about 800 points, and the day of the Nasday 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has dropped by 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
As regards the points, the strongest case of his history (684.81 points) had been recorded earlier on 17 September 2001, the day of the trade decline following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final results, the Nasdag index, mainly related to technology, fell by 199,61 points to 1,983,73, and the widespread Standard & Poors 500 index by 8,81% (106,85 points) to 1,106,55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan to save the banks by the Chamber of Representatives, which was to allow some stability in the markets again, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been hit at the beginning of the quarter.
By 228 votes against and 205 against, the Members refused to give the financial secretary Henry Paulson the means he had asked for.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"This is where a bad picture is put in circulation, which is the inability of Congress to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
'This shows how much the market counted on this plan ', she added, and fears that a project adopted in several days will be' too late '.
"If the project is actually doomed to failure (...), it will soon be the task of the Fed (the American Central Bank, N.D. Red.) and other central banks to control the crisis, which would limit credit conditions even more," warned Brian Bethane, head of the economy at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza stressed, even more so, that she stressed the feeling of extreme urgency that 'every day that passes' would bring the ruin of a financial enterprise 'in the United States'.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the American authorities planned to buy up the bank business of Wachovia by its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated and led to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets are not only facing an American but a global crisis, added the analyst of FDN Financial.
The market for basic goods has grown strongly.
The revenue of the State Bank within ten years has fallen from 3.632% to 3.827% on Friday evening, and revenue within 30 years last night from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Obama, winner by points in the first TV duel
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House of Friday followed another to find out who was the winner of this, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory for the election of both the Republicans and the Democrats in this television duel, which was to be followed by one third of American families.
The political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance was not 'brilliant' enough to enable him to stop his decline in election questions five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, which published an opinion poll on Saturday, according to which Obama is five points ahead (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the democrat clearly makes the better figure.
For the still undecided voters, that is to say, those who are now on the table, Obama was 39% the winner of the polls, while according to a CBS survey, 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm its lead on Thursday with the good performance expected by his competitor Joseph Biden in the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
'It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts, but she warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The seven-year-old McCain did not stop putting his indisputable experience in the field of foreign policy in the foreground, highlighting the 'naivety' of his opponent on these issues, which were the focus of this first television duel.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he stressed several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to become president," he also assured.
A point of attack that has been preached since yesterday in the Republican election campaign.
Obama himself stressed that he represented the future.
He expressed himself briefly and precisely without being removed from the version.
He returned his ability to make good decisions and to renew the image that the world has of the United States.
'McCain has still not understood, but Obama has already ', this weekend a democratic campaign against which Republicans were accused of not having understood the full extent of the crisis that is affecting the' American from the street '.
'During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you, 'Obama denounced yesterday before 20,000 people who had gathered in the rain at an election event in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words' middle-class' or 'workers'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama, which the Americans think is the best way to save the economy even on the edge of the abyss, a clear advantage.
"The next week could be a crucial turning point," estimated the influential democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
The democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton government, compared the 'good economic instincts' of Obama with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current crisis is' the final judgment of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain '.
After stressing once again that he would probably even manage to reduce taxes for 95% of the Americans, despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energy, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, was a top priority for him.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to set up a system of 45 nuclear power stations by 2030.
The two candidates were very concerned about the issues that were on the plan to save the financial market for over $700 billion (EUR 470 billion), which was passed by Congress last night and is extremely unpopular with the people.
'Did you notice that there was a choice in Minsk? '
Young people and opposition people demonstrated Sunday evening on the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians have gathered on Sunday evening since the opening of the election offices in Minsk to protest against the fraudulent character of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against Alexander Lukachenko's power: 'The dictator should resign'.
Some admit that they did not vote at all: 'What good is it if they do what they want with my voice anyway', says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has shown the best light to foreign observers to resume negotiations with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-sharing of visas for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the imposition of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, it wasn't them.
'We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to take part in the count ', regretted Juri Potemkin, Union Press Representative for Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous assembly of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, stresses Alexander Milinkievich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and with us this is the executive.
If Members of the opposition move into Parliament, it is because they were appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals. '
The opposition is therefore guilty of interfering in the political game, because 'dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, gets into a crisis and we do not reform ourselves, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition is concerned that the European Security and Cooperation Organisation, which has followed the course of the election, does not recognise the election as valid.
It stresses that the number of votes appears to be too high and that the extension of the vote in advance (26% of Minsk's voters) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
'Have you noticed that a choice took place?, the leader of social democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polls.
And there will be a maximum of five Members of the opposition in Parliament, those who are most likely to be in line with the government's ideas. '
The silence of the night is down again over the Oktoberplatz.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Discussion - From the blood that became safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and her President, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to be pleased, because Hema-Quebec has become one of the most secure and efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it has regained the public's confidence, which had been severely shaken by the scandal of the contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross's blood donation service were contaminated with the HI virus and the hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this tragedy and the dissatisfaction of the public, in February 1994 the Government of Canada launched a public investigation, led by Judge Horace Krever, to bring light to the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to draw up guidelines to prevent a new disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still hesitant to report, several provinces set up a committee to develop a new system for the management of blood canned in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this task.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company to provide the other provinces and the two territories.
In 1998, when Hema-Quebec started work, hardly 38% of the people had faith in the blood-conserving system in Quebec, Dr. Décary remembers.
The situation was discouraging.
By the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood reserves and by working in this field over the following years, we have regained public confidence ', she says, before proudly stressing that in early 2008, almost 94% of the population of Quebec had had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary is aware that "trust is something extremely fragile."
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has been acting in accordance with the principle of caution.
At that time, we experienced the occurrence of many cases of the human form of the bovine insanity in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, tells this woman, who has been in charge since the foundation of 1998.
And we didn't have the slightest idea if this disease could be transmitted over the blood.
So we were referring to one of the main guidelines of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, which states that exclusion measures are applied if you do not know this and if a disease is only slowly progressing, as is obviously the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999, no blood was taken from people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, no doubt, it was proven that this disease is being transmitted over the blood.
This event has shown us that the principle of caution we used has a meaning.
In 1999, a much more precise technology was published on the market for the detection of HIV: the NST, which allows to demonstrate the presence of the virus itself directly in the blood of the donor, and not the antibodies to the virus, as was the case with the tests used to date.
The NST made it possible to shorten the incubation time that takes place between the time the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected by our techniques in the blood, explains the specialist.
This time could be reduced to less than a week.
The risk of some donors being infected without knowing it and not knowing it was significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transferring AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, one of 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
'In other words, it means that you have to distribute 12 million blood reserves before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood reserves every year, it would take more than 24 years for a case in which HIV was transmitted through a blood conserve.
I believe that today you can feel comfortable getting or prescribing a blood transfusion to restore health ', says Hema-Quebec's director.
'Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogens can get into the system.
Only last year on the island of Réunion the Chikungunya virus, which is transmitted through insects through the blood, as well as the Westnil virus.
We need to monitor continuously ', Dr. Décary continues before she stresses that Hema-Quebec must also provide sufficient supply in addition to a safe supply.
'The need is increasing because the population is ageing.
As cancer control treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has an impact on the blood donor network, which on average only 3% of the people in Quebec who are suitable for blood donation. '
In doing so, any healthy person who is 18 years or older and who meets the criteria of suitability can donate blood every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of the people who provide their blood are not accepted because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and those who have travelled to a country where malaria is widespread are excluded from the blood donation for one year.
'With this 3% we manage to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
The lack of supplies is very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network when they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to keep them and make them become regular donors.
Life is so hectic these days that it is rare to find the time to spend an hour of blood donation ', Francine Décary regrets.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Hema-Quebec not only supplies blood conserved, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart flaps, eyeballs and skin, which is almost exclusively used in severe fire injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, which was previously considered a biomedical waste, contains rich blood stem cells that can serve to treat severe diseases such as leukaemia.
'A few weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousands of umbilical cord blood samples, and we plan to decrease more than a thousand per year.
'We should probably start at the beginning of next year to make it available for transplants', explains Dr. Décary, who describes this program of the umbilical cord loss as very popular.
'Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it 'because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-finals
Yesterday, thanks to a 3-to-1 victory (4-3 with all gates) against the Seattle Sounders, Montreal's Impact has qualified for the semi-final round of the first league of the USL in the Sapito stadium.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive goal in the ninety minute.
After a first half without a gate for both the one side and the other, the middle-field players David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other hits for the formation of Montreals.
Roger Levesque was the only one who got in the way of Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let us remember that in the first game of the pre-and-replay series on Friday Impact the Starfire Complex in Tukwila had brought a 2 to 1 defeat in a suburb of Seattles.
In the semi-finals, impact will be measured with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to balance a 3 to 1 deficit by a 4 to 3 win in the back game in Minnesota, but the Whitecaps still moved into the semi-final round with a total goal ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series will be determined today.
In short - Siegestor by Kovalev
The number one trio of the Canadian team is ready to start the season.
Last night, the unit formed from Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn pushed the attack on the Panther from Florida with a storm fire, leading to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a gate, Plekanec delivered two templates, and Kovalev turned a pass into this victory game, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory games.
Kovalev achieved the victory by shooting the only gate in the whole shooting.
'I'm not ready yet, warned the Russian.
I need another game to make me feel good. '
'He was too much on it in the first half, said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received stormy applause. "
Chare is on the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party was over, Jean-Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (Left) tried to be elected in today's election.
'Deferring the course of our last big border in the north ': This is the long-term objective that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, following the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydropower plants, mines, from Quebec in 'Google Maps', maps, etc.
Large funds, as during the election period.
By the way, the Prime Minister refused to rule out holding the elections this autumn, even if he said that his schedule was very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'vision' which the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely that of a 'new economic area', which provides for an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and an agreement with Ontario.
Although it has been often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches in recent times, the opening of the North - the northern area on the 49th latitude - had never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister limited himself to explaining why the North was' a jewel with enormous potential 'but did not mention a date, no investment sums or precise priorities for the coming projects.
At the most, a few views on what could be done more: water, forest, and mining, in particular, are in favour of growth in emerging markets and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to Mr Charests, the north has nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds.
This' area twice the size of France 'is close to us, is in Quebec.
It is not only in our vicinity, it is in us', he stressed how to clearly show that he is looking to realize a national incubator dream.
Quebec has grown very much through its connection with the north, he stressed: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technology of Quebec, the James Bay.
'It is ours, it is our future, 'he added, after he had taken a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of the Quebec area, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always requested, said the Prime Minister to the press.
This is a traditional attitude that all governments pursued.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity is given, I will take this position again on behalf of the government ', he said.
In addition, "with climate change we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said and talked about the Northwest Passage, which will be accessible all year round due to the ice melt.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the area, the Native and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful about them, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pekist Member of Ungava) have already started discussions with about thirty communities.
A ministerial committee led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) occupies an important place, has started work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity where 'one will create a common vision'.
The development of the North will also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The plan North is' discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly ', he promised.
Jean Charest described this' vision 'as being a continuation of those of the liberal prime ministers who were in office before him.
'Like the liberals who were in office before us, we have rethought to turn the challenges into new growth and development opportunities.
This was, by the way, one of the recurring topics of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a big cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the taking over of the party leadership by Jean Lesage.
One of the decisions adopted provides for the renaming of the Beauharnois power plant into Adélard Godbolt dam.
"From Godbolt, who created Hydro-Quebec, about Lesage, who achieved the silent revolution and the nationalisation of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future," said Jean Chare.
He referred to another conservative project to the press, the 'Roads to the North' programme by John DiefenBaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydropower dam project, Mr Chare stressed that it was planned to start in 2012.
'This remains between us, but I intend to be there ', he entrusted to his party members what caused the incident.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly in 2009, has in fact not yet ruled out the possibility of holding a choice this autumn, which is possible from the law.
He stressed, however, that his schedule was full, in particular because of a mission by the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the weekend provided the Liberal Party Chief with a platform of nationalist plans, in particular 'objectives concerning the Constitution', which were clearly adopted: the PLQ particularly calls for the recognition of the 'peculiarity of Quebec' in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Council of Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications and to have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition has taken up the guidelines of the North Plan with scepticism.
The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has re-established the policy for the development of the North-du-Quebec, which the Landry government introduced in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, did not apply it.
If she had done it, 'we would have been much further today', Mrs Marois, on the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today), would have judged Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has expressed its support for the government's adoption of a North Plan.
'But what we want is that this is not just a big idea, 'said the party leader Sébastien Poulx, representing Mario Dumont, who is coming back from the holiday today.
Letters - A dishonored country
Mr Vic Toews, ex-Justice Minister (which irony) in the Cabinet of Harper, who last summer allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour that she was a 'shame' for Canada.
This woman, who has led a not-ending fight for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover with shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government that has not taken home the only one from all the countries concerned to their fellow countryman, who was caught in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn't even take into account that Omar Kadr was still a young man when the things that were accused of him happened.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and lets a child soldier go under inhumane conditions.
The only one who's going down to a judicial parody to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International, and the Canadian lawyers' association, in particular, are pleading to bring Omar Kadr home so that he can get a fair trial in Canada.
This very government is also closing its eyes to torture: it is of little interest to her that after so many years of suffering, a young adult will surely be mentally broken.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are now experiencing a treacherous circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word that Harper is constantly wearing as a flag before him, and that sounds so unspeakable from his mouth.
The time has come for no more morality: a Canadian citizen is allowed to be arbitrarily abused, tortured and imprisoned, in accordance with the views of a head of government, which is only supported by the minority to date (may he be a minority after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that they can find their salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has untold itself of what made the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr Toews, lies in this discharge, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellish Speech by Barrick Gold
In its issue of 17 September, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, Vice-Director-General of the Canadian Goldmine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and is pursuing an orthodox logic, that the world's largest gold-winning company has sought a slander action over six million against three authors and a small, mediocre publishing house, with the aim of opening a 'public transparent debate'.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they will not judge the truth, especially in the case of slander, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to have a public debate is to drive everyone to ruin, who dares to represent one of their opposite views.
No matter how the trial goes, the authors and the editor of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid from the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
Moreover, the tactics of these unequal struggles are often to ruin the defenders in order to force a consensual regulation that makes the other side dead and also discourages anyone who dares to re-examine the question.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she should have presented her view of things before public opinion.
In contrast, what is going on and going on in many of the countries in which Barrick Gold works, in Canada, debates are usually carried out through the exchange of ideas and not by the hugs.
It would therefore have been enough if the Goldmine had opened up its books and files and opened a real debate that could have brought light to this question by the newspapers, the media, publications and the financing of independent audit teams.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have any confidence in public opinion and wipes away the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how he can at the same time ask for a 'public' debate, while still disrespecting the opinions of this public?
It seems that this word in the world of the Vice-President only includes the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a very narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even slander have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public, which supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada, is doing this mainly because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is ready to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as a beeble action (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold has just made a request to the authors of Noir Canada, in which she asks them not to use this term...).
In addition to Mr Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's lawsuit is a direct attack on the freedom to academic research and the truth-finding, which are fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to explore and discuss issues that do not like the rich companies of the world, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to control debates and inconsistencies and resolve conflicts.
The disproportionate action by Barrick Gold clearly shows that, unlike what it says, it does not want to have a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it is time for governments to take measures that limit this kind of unjustified action.
Rescue for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand each other
The Bush administration and the leading congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most extensive economic recovery plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan of over $700 billion to stop the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months still needs to be adopted by the two congresses.
The main content is: better control by Members of Parliament on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the public funds used, new powers to reduce the number of houses held due to the delays in payments, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the senior employees of the supported companies.
The American financial secretary Henry Paulson, the President of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and the representative of the Republicans, Senator Judd Gregg, who was present in the negotiations, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market effective," said the Bush administration representative, Henry Paulson.
'It all happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the course crisis on Wall Street, 'said the Democrat.
'This is the fundamental point: if we do not, the trauma, chaos and unrest in the daily lives of the Americans will be enormous, 'said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, for fear of the effect that a new failure would have had on the mood of investors.
The deadline that had been agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two American presidential candidates who took part in the negotiations at a late date were more likely to be supporters of the agreement, but without failing to express their dissatisfaction at the need to meet them in this extreme way.
The democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on adding certain powers to the agreement, in particular those to enable the owners to keep their houses, and those relating to the salaries of the senior employees of the companies saved by the state.
'If you ask the taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the lack of responsibility of certain people, that is nothing to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary ', he said on the American television stations.
When he was asked on another channel whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain answered: 'I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
'The guidelines I have read show that this is one thing that we all need to digest, and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable ', he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is aimed at, with the money of taxpayers
It comes 14 months after a crisis caused by the burst of a real estate bubble, which first led to the collapse of risk-like mortgage loans (subprime) before it spread to more widespread bonds (PCAA), and finally to a freeze of financial power and into the ruin of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican Members who failed the first attempt to reach agreement last week.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain 'toxic' assets of the companies in distress are only to be secured by the government and not bought, the dead end is to be found.
In order to close the perspective for everyone in Congress, one has also added a decision that, if the government is to make losses with this programme within five years, it can then raise new taxes in order to get back its capital used.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion may be added if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of a further 350 billion will have to be passed by the Congress in a new vote.
In return for his help Washington receives shares in the supported companies that bring him dividends in the case of profits and that it can sell again when the storm is over.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to hold the detention procedures relating to the apartments linked to the real estate loans affected by this plan and to set time limits for the repayment and the payments to the senior employees of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the House of Representatives to vote on him already today, and then the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get green light.
In fact, there were further votes against this project yesterday, both from the Republicans and the Democrats.
"Obviously Washington does not understand us," said Republican Scott Garett, member of the Board's Financial Commission, his constituents.
'Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the ones who are asking the taxpayers to cash in. '
The democratic MEP Brad Sherman, head of a group in Congress, called 'the Caucasus of Skeptics', is different, but comes to the same conclusion.
'Four hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to tell us that we ask the Congress not to be put under pressure and to carefully consider which way to go ', he said yesterday.
At the same time, we in Europe have again been given proof that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French Bank announced BNP Paribas that it would not buy up its competitor, which is in great difficulty since it lost EUR 2 billion ($2.9 billion) in the crisis due to the risk-rich real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'This is not lost money, said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
To compensate for this, we have a right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the savers and households appreciate now that unsafe times are announcing themselves. '
During this time, on the other side of the Channel, the British Government was in the process of nationalising another bank that was under threat from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans from Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion ($755 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish Bank Santander announced yesterday that it would purchase the banks and the customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley, after Northern Rock, would be the second bank that the British government has had to nationalise since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a committed icon
His beauty with the azure blue eyes was for a long time his trump, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor have the charming smile free himself from the narcissistic mirror?
Yes and no.
His senses, his sensitivity and an obvious talent have probably kept him away from a position of power that brings about the truly terrible monsters.
But what a great long-standing man!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 from the consequences of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and for whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more careful in his acting, and certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the explosion of dramaturgic conventions.
Missing blood often results in wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
The European roots should be one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality feature.
For in him, a whole country, which was in love with the self-made man, was reflected in the fighters who were injured in the battle in the Pacific War, who studied acting art in Yale in the early 1950s and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York before he had success in the theatre, television and soon also in the cinema.
This man, who was fighting for civil rights, was also the driver who was in 1979 at the 24-hour race of Mans Second, and also a sex symbol, although he and the actress Joanne Woodward lived in a preview since 1958.
With him also the unknown facets of this mysterious, restrained, committed and sensitive star, which will never be completely solved by the glamour of show business, disappear.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newmans put the cinema lovers in Taumel this weekend, while on the dark screen of memories all his great roles were played.
More than half a century of American film art in constant change is moving forward with him.
The charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) is again in memory, and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) into The Cat on the hot sheet roof, which was filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much shorter memory (1990) is being raised, which is to his sensitive Lord Bridge, who at his age is disturbed by a wedding that did not all fulfil their promises.
There were so many other Paul Newmans in the course of history.
This criminal, stormy, violent, and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Like Me (A hand full of dirt) by Robert Wise, a role that was intended for James Dean, after his death was rerecorded and the Newman was well known in 1956.
This sympathetic ganove in the outstanding The Sting (The Clou), which was awarded the Oskar for the best film in 1973.
As a bitter and vengeful billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
That face through the times, that was him.
Still him.
In his CV, epochs unite.
The youth knows him from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little Orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
The county closed with a final role in 2003 as the father of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes.
In contrast to several cinemas who have retired from the film world early enough, Newman should stay in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, his fortune, his prunk and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without a sense of humor, as a living challenge to the 'underplaying' when he assessed his too expressive achievements.
The Metier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles only flew for a long time.
However, he played rare Sunnyboys as outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, feverish or desperate, with whose perfect representation he reflected his descent and his resurrection.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown pages of his true sensitive sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, drew a fine portrait of women full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott through an overdose, dedicated his film Harry and Son, a work full of fine feelings and sadness.
In the flood of honours that struck Newman yesterday, his close friend and former weapons companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said very much: 'His presence has improved my life and this country.'
generosity and joy of life were the essential characteristics of the late actor.
In addition to his legendary career, a great advocate of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of the abduction of Hollywood, is now going there.
We have often seen him standing with his foot in a bowl of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other food, and we thought this was quite tasteless, even though we thought it was funny at first.
However, the profits from his sales went to his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed himself to the shot.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: 'Your father was always incredibly grateful for his good star, and to the very end.
It was an honor to be here. '
And for us it was an honor to be able to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the strictest and broadest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of supplement & amp; Co.??
On October 8, the negotiations in the criminal proceedings against Jáno's contract and his accomplices will begin.
The defendants are accused, in particular, of participation in organised crime, of gross negligence and of business fraud, and of other criminal acts, including, inter alia, the falsification of documents.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the funds from the calls for tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often provided with counterfeit invoices.
State funds and grants from self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are to be found in the funds of the Fiatal Baloldal organisation, and in the private funds of the individual.
As the investigation authorities announced, fictitious invoices were submitted when the tender money was received and the associations should not have fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, a large part of the bills were falsified.
The accounting blocks were bought on the market of Józsefváros, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies the invoices are to be issued was taken on that round trip north of the Lake Plattensee, to which István Lados was sent by János.
In the course of this "exploration tour," Lado was supposed to find pensions and restaurants.
He asked for invoices about the consumption to be able to issue invoices for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social and Labour, and the self-administration of Budapest later on.
The majority of these invoices were to have been manipulated by István Lados and his accomplice András Úri, who, according to our information, was to have been responsible for the constitution of the relevant reports.
One of the objectives of Lados' "exploration tour" was a beer-shop.
As can be seen from two invoices issued by contract and co in 2003, the restaurant company is supposed to have managed the nine-head group of the Biztos Pont Egypt Association.
But now the head of the company says that such a large group would not have fit into the local at once.
Another invoice, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also had serious malformations and contents.
In a pension in Badacsonytomaj, which only has three rooms and can accommodate no more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests are said to have stayed.
The imagination of the bill-forgers was apparently no limit as it was about the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy company, in whose accounting documents of the customers Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá did not even appear at all according to the charges.
As Managing Director Győző Farkas reported to hvg.hu, he immediately realized that these were counterfeit documents when documents were submitted to him by the Public Prosecutor during an interview.
"Our company name and the tax number were misplaced on the stamp."
And further: Apart from malpractice, the fact that the company was supposed to have housed a hundred people after having a total of 11 rooms that are impossible to accommodate so many people was also wrong.
It was also mentioned on the bill that the restaurant was no longer in operation for a long time.
The encumbered falsifiers have also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they are looking for offers only travel abroad, and so they have indicated Hungary's travel on the cash account, which was also contrary to the company's accounting practice.
As has been known in the course of the investigation, they have also referred to the invoices for VAT, although travel agency services relating to a country outside the EU are VAT-free.
The total amount of VAT was wrong on four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfulöp Kft. to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, since the company, instead of 25, only 15 percent VAT, is charged, and the employees are only issuing machine invoices, but the counterfeit documents were handwritten.
Another error that had been made to the "accounting officers" was that in one case they had stated "goods transport" as a service provided, although this is not offered by the company specialised in investment advice, the public prosecutor informed.
It was also due to errors of form - false accounting format, false stamp - that the invoices issued to Egypt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egypt and Biztos Pont could be revealed as forgeries.
Also in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehértó, whose managing director claimed that they had never issued the invoices.
Another "mistake" is the falsifiers at the HIB Kf. from Nyíregyháza: this company was in the process of being dissolved at the time (2001) when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egysület was supposed to have eaten there - the mass manager therefore stated that the invoices had not been issued itself.
Consciously falsified
The other group of accountants are persons who were well aware that they would have to place fictional invoices.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány has issued invoices for the Foundation Egypt a Harmadik Évezredért, at an amount of about HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the director of the Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictional invoices.
The Biogate Kft., which is currently in liquidation, is also expected to have worked together with a supplement and co.: In 2003, the company is expected to have provided the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, as well as the associations Atlasz Egypt and Vörösphenyő Egypt with counterfeit invoices in the total value of HUF 5 million, which relate to undelivered services.
However, there was also little payment since the invoices were cancelled immediately after their issue, which the parties had forgotten to mention in their documents.
The third group of auditors shall include persons directly associated with the defendants.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of the Delta Trió Kft., a fuel and vehicle trading company based in Budapest, but not found there.
This company is expected to have issued several invoices for the sale of computer components in the total value of HUF about 18 million in the period October to December 2005.
According to the investigation authority, the cash investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, has acted as the buyer of these invoices.
The company's managing director was a roman to which the company's documents should also be sent by Iván Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, during the investigation, Kubatov confessed to having issued invoices on behalf of the GmbH. to the associations Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Egypt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have collected their equivalent.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. as well as the Jos-Investment Bt. are to have been founded by Romanian walls on Iván Kubatov's express wish.
In truth, however, none of these companies were active, which according to the defendant was in lack of orders.
However, he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Scente, who was responsible for preparing the company's founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the contract, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
In total, Kubatov has issued 15 invoices in the total value of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organisations.
The Public Prosecutor's Office assumes that Kubatov could have collected 10% of the sum of the account and VAT.
Kubatov has even abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the issue of fictional invoices - in this case the invoices were settled with the applications of Biztos Pont.
The company Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA") in January 2006.
Both received 500,000 forint, but they used these amounts for purposes.
To cover this up, they have presented to the TMA five fictional invoices of the Works Team Kft...
These invoices were also secured in the search of the office of Árpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
In the negotiations, some of the defendants are now expected to have a confession on the way in which the accounts were forged, as they were already filed before the prosecutor's office.
A sensation could be if the main defendant of János decided to make a comprehensive confession.
His previous information was less detailed, and although he had already promised to report on everything in detail several times, his confession is still outstanding.
The question remains, therefore, whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him on the reparation of the bulk of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether a supplement is in return to take responsibility.
However, it is quite possible that the "insulted" will now play a "award" after his requests for relief of detention and house arrest had been met.
While other criminals, who have done far greater damage to economic crimes and have not paid for it, are on their feet, or at least under house arrest, this possibility is denied.
The psychology of overbidding - or why we are willing to pay more
In the case of auctions, the buyers tend to spend more and thus overvalue the file.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now been able to discover the neurological and economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behaviour.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people do not want to be beaten in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even higher prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers should play lotto while the other took part in a playful action - in both cases the active brain regions of the subjects were examined by means of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the brain, was measured in the loss of the auction, in which the adversary's overbidding plays an essential role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore considered that the price increase could be explained by the prevention of an overreaction of the striatum.
In order to support their thesis, the economists in the research group have also done research on the follow-up of the money.
In this case, three groups should be involved against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their bets.
Another group was also promised a $15 reward in case they came out of the game as winners.
The third group received $15 before the auction, which was also lost in the event of a lost game.
So the difference between the two groups was that the emphasis was on one on winning, while the other on losing.
However, as evidence of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, the members of the "against losing" group were ready for higher stakes than those in the control group or the "profit" group.
"These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
These have so far only justified the behaviour observed in auctions with the joy of winning or avoiding risk.
The contradiction between these two theories was resolved thanks to the imaging neurological procedures, so that we now have a third explanation ready "- said Andrew Schotter, Professor of the Business Faculty of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should the doctor be visited?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people is estimated to be hundreds of thousands in this country, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and the diseases differ.
Depending on the disease, the hepatic viruses spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E by the digestive tract (for example by contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted by blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, secretion or saliva).
Travelers are recommended to vaccinate against viruses A and B in any case, and there is no vaccine against virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A are approximately two to three weeks after the consumption of the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and vomiting.
Then the jaundice occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine dark, and the recovery can last for up to two-three weeks.
Around 1 million people die every year from the far more severe diseases caused by hepatitis B, such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only every tenth infected person is in medical treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: it may lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer without treatment.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, as the pathogen surgically destroys the liver cells - in many cases the first symptoms show up after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular controls, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who have had blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattoos.
At present, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease is already detectable in a routine laboratory study, it is advisable to visit the doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
In time, the disease is cured, the virus can be eradicated, thus eliminating the risk of infection and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30 is the world day of hepatitis, for the first time organized by patient representatives worldwide.
The aim of the action is to raise awareness of this chronic inflammation of the liver caused by viruses, their origin and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As the latest research results show, religious faith is like a kind of "painkillers," which should have already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: it has been studied to what extent faith in God affects the sense of pain of man, the British paper "Telegraph."
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electric shocks while studying a painting by the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the faithful were able to take out most of the pain.
A brain scan technology even proved that Catholics could activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain control.
The research was the first in a research project in which, in addition to scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university also participate.
When the subjects were tried, a radiant device was connected to the left hand, which gave off the electric shocks.
The participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: one is a picture of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and the other is Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady with Hermelin."
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary among the faithful would create a kind of religious trance while choosing Vinci's image, because it was hardly different from the other painting and felt reassuring.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and at that time they received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while they should either look at the religious or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that at the sight of the Mother of God they felt "safe" as if they were "worried about" and they felt "peace and peace."
During the viewing of the religious painting, they reported about 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo's work in mind.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the experiment, said that you could also produce similar effects with other, strong-acting images among the atheists, you just need to find the appropriate photo.
"We need to find a picture that causes very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," says the psychologist.
The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change our personality and do it in many cases," says Wright.
According to these excellent results, only the question remains what effect a Madonna image of Leonardo or another similar painter would have on the pain regulation of the faithful.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You're what you tell me about yourself
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can say with a fright: it is in the pockets of people as much as it is in the sky: it knows where people have spent their holidays, to which specialists they go, and what moves them.
And still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google's managing directors.
In the direction of skeptics, which are plagued by Orwell's horror visions, he says: these would just overlook the essence of the Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that Google's main objective was to collect more personal data about the users and thus to get closer to the company's original objective of "ordering all the information in the world."
Schmidt said that after ten years of world-changing work, Google was still only at the beginning of the information collection.
When asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wanted Google to be able to answer questions such as "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really fits me?" but software programs are not yet able to do so because they don't know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet searches the search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which the search was made and the visited pages.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to store his own search process and to use it later, so that the results can be generated much more precisely later, and the same logic is based on the so-called "recommendations" that the system recommends tailor-made products and services due to the earlier preferences.
However, users are wondering what happens in the event of a data abuse - "When you look at what I do" - some people are worried about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is rather the potential power represented by the company that is causing fear, and less the guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom, or the desire for the power that many Internet users are opposed to.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties in the event of an investment, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
One example of this was the recent action against pedophilia in Brazil, in which Google provided the Brazilian government with information collected by the Community side called "Orkut" and also enabled the identification of the pedophiles.
However, for personal rights, users were able to breathe up in May, when Google, together with the civil rights organisation EFF, successfully brought the FBI to justice: therefore, Google cannot be forced to issue information to the FBI in any future with any point of the Constitution on a secret request.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully obtained the issue of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the Youth Protection Act adopted years ago, but it has been withheld from the list of individual users, or their web and search list for two months retroactively.)
So Google's image remains controversial: those who hate to issue their personal data because by using Google services they fear the loss of their private and intimate sphere, the company bothers with the indignation of the conservative companies.
However, the American "geek culture," which is present in many countries, and is united by enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, is the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is the market leader thanks to Windows, even though both are fighting for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that Google does not demand any identification codes from its users, unlike Microsoft, and provides its services free of charge, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package seems to be much more attractive, young and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks are looking at the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet - a relationship that has been at the centre of focus, especially in recent years, thanks to the term "Web 2.0."
The "Web 2.0" is about nothing but collaboration, that is to say, the users leave their tracks on purpose and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individual, the main thing remains to show themselves publicly.
An average young person can also manage his profile on several community portals - from Facebook to Xanga, they can connect with each other through other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually integrate all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can lead blogs that automatically represent the latest photo galleries that are listed on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other examples prove that when looking at the party photos of last night, the girlfriend soon finds out who her unfaithful friend has been enjoying, or the employee is being released because in his blog he is only too honest about his trouble about the management of the company - one thing is certain: the term "privacy" has been completely reinterpreted.
Those who live an online life are what they reveal - for example, one could formulate the basic idea behind the behaviour of today's youth.
And if you try to keep a little secret, or even avoid the Google monopoly, you can do so - like with Scroogle, a tool that, while accessing Google's search engine, does not intentionally leave any trace.
Not a few people do not intentionally register on Community pages so that they are not visible, but also the online applications of Google, such as text processing and graphic tools and RSS feeds, can be handled with alternative versions that are not linked to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible profile from the user.
However, public opinion is waiting for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising areas of AdWords / AdSense are threatening the revenue of the advertising agencies, and the increasingly rapidly introduced services are not only breaking up Microsoft but also other software developers.
Critical viewers, however, also find the worrying counter-pole: For example, the Group's management has completely rejected a protest from the employees after the fees of the company's own kindergarten were doubled, and the management said that the multiple food of the employees was too expensive. But all this is quite mild to say that Google even went to the knees in 2006 before the Chinese government and agreed to an agreement that all the regime-critical hits, or those who are in breach of good taste, would be filtered out.
The Group's internal regulation is that no new service will be advertised in advance, but only if it is already available. However, the events of the coming months and years could be a little more serious: while some of my, Google's book and magazine / archiving project now assumes that the company will have to deal with the Supreme Court soon, others are concerned about the health system, which allows the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database, the next generation of Sci-Fi authors already provides the substance - for example, "Scroogled," the famous novel by Cory Doctorov describes in the best orwell-known way a future in which a human being becomes terrifying, thanks to Google-related data.
Two young people help the double killer of Ózd to eliminate the trace.
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police have now interrogated two young people who are suspected of being involved in the removal of the tracks, the spokesman of the police commissioner Borsod informed on Tuesday.
The young people were strenuous and are currently being charged with the aid.
According to the news agency MTI, they are two girls who defend themselves freely.
Aid is threatened with a period of imprisonment of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
The man is under an urgent suspicion of having deliberately killed several people out of money.
The investigation showed that the 23-year-old had owed a 53-year-old a larger amount of money.
The suspect, however, did not want to pay off his debts, so he lured his creditor to an area in Ózd last Wednesday, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has long-hand planned the act - this also proves the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the crime scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the murder weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange places purchase offer for Prague Stock Exchange
Around EUR 200 million, or 5 billion Czech kroner, has offered the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the 100% purchase of the stock packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer that Poland had made despite the fact that they were previously excluded from the Czech market as possible owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is entirely owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, but they want to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to the Czech daily "E15," the offer to Poland includes the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have made offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange last week said that of all the interested parties the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague stock exchange to 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders' agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25% stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments on the ever-increasing international financial crisis, some European leaders already spoke on Tuesday of "second 11 September."
We owe the global financial disaster to the American President, for example, "La Repubblica" - the President had not even been able to put his own party behind him for the draft law, which should bring some relief into the frightening situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor," as the billion-dollar investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second 11 September."
Parts of the press in Madrid also place the scapegoat in Washington.
The "El Mundo" believes that the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the world economy is now on the verge of the collapse.
The American financial system is increasingly threatening to collapse, and that will lead to the suffering of the whole world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, now, after the vote in Congress, the risk is that Washington will not have a political means of crisis management.
The world economy is in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations of the history of capitalism is taking place.
One can no longer ignore the threat, for example the Geneva "day-indicator."
While some countries could still provide their money institutions with their money, they could save the banks from bankruptcy with the taxpayers' money.
However, if a dominant effect is triggered and more banks are going to fail, then no further financial injections or other emergency measures will help.
In the long term, EU Member States should jump over their shadow and centralise control over the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion of weak money institutions were paid out, the Vienna "The Standard." In addition, the newspaper says that the concerns are more and more realistic that after the Americans, European taxpayers must now also take a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not been seriously dealing with the crisis that is now, like a tsunami on the old continents.
While the "savior" would not have to "wade" with several hundred billion euros immediately, it would be advisable to note in which case it would be reasonable to touch the taxpayers' money in order to avoid even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the Hummel
What would be the best way to develop new technologies to prevent accidents, if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, the bees.
At the CEATEC in Japan an amazing project was presented, in which the Nissan engineers of Hummeln were inspired in the creation of new accident-avoiding systems.
In cooperation with the Tokyo University, Nissan has built the BR23C-type biomimetic system controlled by car robots, a mini-car equipped with the characteristics of the bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collision.
In the flight, each bee forms its own, oval "private area," which is very similar to our own "shield," said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role in this.
In order to imitate the function of the composite eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C in a 180-degree field of vision within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor to board, which immediately initiates the collision-avoiding process.
The obstacle is recorded in seconds, and the car robot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees by turning the tires around the appropriate angle.
Unlike previous systems, this maneuver is purely instinctive.
"If not, the car robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the car robot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the inner and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents are still considered to be inevitable.
The whole process must reflect the behaviour of the bees when they avoid other bees.
And this has to be done in a fraction of a second.
However, in contrast to the bees, it is not possible to go up, down, or even diagonal - it can only be two-dimensional, only towards the weathering of the tyres.
While the bees are at an infinitely wide range of possibilities to avoid other bees, the researchers in the car engine were able to use only the rotary movement, or the acceleration and deceleration.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient and therefore have a longer life life than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it depends on the instinctive, intelligent reaction, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device must only process a few inputs per second and respond accordingly to them.
It does not have to save these, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction on the basis of previous maneuvers, so that it is constantly using only a handful of KB memory.
There is no need for gigabytes and megabytes of severe memories.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collision prevention technology, which Nissan considers to be in production as standard within the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by consciously directing the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to the goal.
A name for the sinful child
The written version of the $700 billion rescue package, which will be applied in several stages, is now available and is aimed at the purchase of the banks' bad loans.
In the first passage, half of the money is to be spent.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight, the congressmen, after several days of debates, have been through an agreement on the $700 billion rescue package, reported Reuters.
"We have made substantial progress," said Nancy Pelosi, President-in-Office of the United States, and said that the agreement should be put to paper.
The compromise reached on the rescue package was supported by both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said that the programme will have an effect and it will be efficient, but it will have to do more. According to Pelosi, this was not about saving Wall Street, but about going around the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e., Washington time Sunday night 8: 00 (Central European time Monday 2: 00 in the morning), but did not trigger a high-altitude flight on the stock exchange.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote on the draft law on the stabilisation of the economy of 2008, then the Senate will be ready.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, White House spokesman.
The programme, however, deviates from the Bush administration's original recommendation that the $700 billion should be spent on the purchase of faultless, credit-driven securities at once.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the 700 billion is to be spent, with 250 billion available immediately after the Congress is expected to vote on the Causa on Monday, which is to be used for the purchase of credit-driven, bad securities, and the further USD 100 billion will be decided by the President.
The programme will be reviewed by a Commission of its own, which also belongs to the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on a further decision of the Congress.
For the purposes of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactic: it can also purchase bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-backed securities, or other "toxic" loans.
As competent persons of the Ministry reported, the purchase can be made both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the worrying resources and the companies pay the appropriate fees for the damage to be expected.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds so that up to $700 billion can be made available as an emergency aid to the American financial system, whether for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or for the prevention of a systemic risk caused by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed, says Paulson.
However, the heads of the banks in difficulty and now designated for state aid can expect to be cut off by the government, which is called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas slang.
There will only be a reduction in salaries in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance is helping out.
The reduction essentially means that if the Ministry purchases in an auction, the "Golden Handshake" is taxed, unless the served bank chief is deported to the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of the bad loans, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the managers' salaries are not overrun.
The picture also includes the fact that the existing Golden Handshake contracts are not changed - the restrictions only refer to new agreements, so that the more people participate in the programme.
This is the first case in American history that cuts in managers' salaries are regulated by law, the Democrat Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Committee, commented on the measure.
The State gains participation rights in participating banks, thus reducing the risk to taxpayers, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus also the saved bank are better.
The draft law requires the President to submit a proposal to Congress over the next five years to get the taxpayers back their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were sceptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American citizens expect from us, the plan does not protect the taxpayers' money, according to the California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said that the measures were promoted by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise

The domestic sales prices have increased only slightly compared to the previous month, i.e. by 0.1 percent.
The sales prices of the manufacturing industry also increased only a little - 0.1 percent - since July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was in leather goods (2.8 percent) - mainly bags and belts - where the increase was 4.6 percent, and in shoes prices were 2.5 percent high.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials significantly increased prices for chemicals and production (1.6 percent).
A decrease in prices was recorded in crude oil processing (1.4%), in electrical and technical equipment (0.9%) and in wood processing (0.1%).
The prices in paper production, publishing and printing remained unchanged.
In other sectors of manufacturing, a price increase of between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent was measured.
In the major domestic markets of industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices increased by 0.3% in August, mainly as a result of the increase in gas prices introduced on 1 July.
In the case of the domestic markets of the manufacturing industry in the year-on-year comparison, prices in crude oil processing have increased most (32.4%).
In the metal processing sector, a 13.2% increase was observed, while the increase in the production of food, beverages and tobacco was 11%.
A decrease in prices was observed in the textile industry (2.5%) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3%).
The level of inflation in the other manufacturing industries was between 0.6 and 9.1%.
In total, prices in the manufacturing industry climbed by 10.2 percent last year.
Prices for electricity, gas, steam and water increased by 18.7 percent compared to the previous year.
The highest price increase in the domestic sales market was recorded in the investment goods sector in August (0.7%).

In the consumer goods sectors, a price increase of 6.8% was noted, while in the case of investment goods a price reduction of 1.4% was noted.
Industrial export prices in Forint increased by 1.1% in August compared to the previous month, but in the year-on-year comparison there was a decrease of 3.9%.
The domestic currency was weaker than the euro by 1.7 percent, the dollar by 7.1 percent, and compared to the August 2007 rate, it became stronger by 7.5 percent compared to the euro, and even by 15.9 percent in the dollar.
No more visa to the United States from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good opportunities for the US-Hungarian visa agreement to enter into force on 12 January, as the Foreign Minister said before the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In her view, "everything now depends only on whether the electronic immigration or control system is being introduced in a timely manner in overseas."
However, she also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy has been negotiating in Washington today.
She meets Minister of Foreign Affairs Condoleezza Rice, who will give her the "Middle Cross of Merit with Star" of the Republic of Hungary, and she also talks with the foreign policy advisers of the Democrat Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support rescue package for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the big American parties, promised their support for the $700 billion rescue package for banks on Sunday, but there are also politicians who call for the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
The Congress and government representatives have announced, after coming to marathon discussions on Sunday morning, that they have reached an agreement on the bank rescue package.
The crisis of Wall Street, as well as the fading up of the frozen credit market, became the key issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be more suitable than the respective opponent to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
After recent surveys, Obama was able to further develop its lead thanks to the economic issues, while McCain's high, who gave him the presentation of Vice-President Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, has also melted.
At an election campaign in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly adopt the law on the $700 billion package.
He stressed that the plan also includes the passages of consumer protection that he has supported.
"We must act now, responsible (...) - your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened" - he said before 35,000 spectators.
He did not fail to call McCain's economic visions "obsolet."
In an interview given to the ABC station, McCain said: "We will all have a hard time (...) but non-stun is certainly no alternative."
The Republican senator said that the plan also requires the establishment of a control commission for the Minister of Finance, as well as the limitation of the arrangements for top managers - something that he had insisted on.
The CBS told Obama that McCain had not played a definite role in the negotiations, while he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Representatives would probably vote on the draft law on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking area
The right camp is intact, only the voters became more confident within the camp - so "The mirror" comments on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the German news magazine on the left, Franz Walter analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayern's Revolution destroys her fathers."
According to the renowned political scientist, the CSU's erosion began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber-Duo took over his duties.
The Christian Social have renewed Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The break of the epoch is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as is the case for Angela Merkel.
The CSU's disaster was not surprising, but on Sunday something came to an end, which was already quite exactly ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state party
For ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, and for the first time since the 1950s it fell below the 50% mark.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, in other words in the much-quoted Stoiber era.
Finally, the modernisation carried out by the CSU in the Federal Republic has destroyed its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but at a rate of considerable appreciation, but without impact, secularisation, the educational success, the increase of East and North German to the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain on the allegiance of CSU voters.
Modernisation is always accompanied by an increase in options, and this has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and independent.
It is striking that in the last few weeks the classical groups of citizens have expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the liberal professions, the industrial citizenship and voters with a degree, such as higher education.
Here, the CSU's support fell to less than 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily reports on the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections in their "Who with whom? Party leaders restrained in coalition issues."
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the interference of the SPÖ in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to discussion in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to establish themselves in relation to a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything is about the coalition; in the debates on public television, the party leaders were hardly able to look into their cards.
SPÖ head Werner Faymann confirmed his wish to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is very well possible - in some federal countries and in the social partnership this is already the case.
The question whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP boss as vice-Chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, the voters would have chosen the bowl-molterer course.
It would not be possible to repeat this direction.
However, Molterer has responded carefully to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, if Faymann tries to interfere with the internal concerns of the ÖVP.
Whether his party is in opposition or in the coalition is now completely open and these issues should be discussed internally.
BZÖ-Chef Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"In order to prevent red-black, we are ready to take over government responsibility," says Haider.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities has started, which is now being addressed by the EU Presidency, France.
In her speech to the Assembly, Mr Járóka, MEP of the European People's Party, drew attention to the education segregation, as it is one of the most serious legal violations that Roma children have, and this was the main obstacle to their need for application.
The High Level Conference was opened by French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The participants included representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal and civil society organisations in the area of equal opportunities.
As the Press Office of the MEPs of the Fides reports, Járóka has pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in job search, the Roma would be forced out of the labour market because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma young people do not have middle school education and, thanks to poor primary education, only a small part of them can reach higher education."
In addition, Járóka stressed that education was a fundamental human right, which would have a key role to play in the implementation of other human rights.
Investment in early training of Roma children could strengthen the economy of EU Member States.
In the view of the Members, it is important that these links become as broad as possible - that is, Roma and non-Roma.
The sooner a Roma student starts school, the more his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market are increased, and through income and turnover taxes they contribute to national expenditure.
"As citizens of the Union, the Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - the poor and segregated education must be stopped" - said Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Members have said, a common, objective and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary to speed up the process of deregulation in the education sector, and it is essential to ensure that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives are complied with correctly.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as a fully-fledged citizen," Járóka asked.
Since the Berlin Congress last year, the summit has been held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the achievement of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European and national level, within the meaning of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities."
CSU: grace on time
At the end of October the fate of the fallen Duos Huber-Beckstein is decided
In spite of the election debate, no heads are at present rolling, at the top of the Bavarian CSU the human resources debates were postponed.
Chief of the Party Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein are still in their offices, the question is how long does this grace last?
The fate of the dance after the disastrous 17% loss of voice is decided on the last October weekend at the extraordinary party day.
The much-trained duo, however, already made it clear that it does not want to stick to their armchairs.
In this way, they want to frighten the angry group and the party base, which one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences in view of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, the Christian-Social Union reached 60.7%. Now, however, one year after the coup against Stoiber, they were able to secure only 43.4% of the votes.
For 46 years the CSU was "sole government" in Bavaria, which generates 18% of German GDP.
The Conservatives remain the determining force in the southern federal state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, but will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As a first sign of the internal restructuring of the parties, the potential successor of Hubers, Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer is also involved in the investigation team with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing "free voter" of an exploratory discussion about a possible Munich coalition.
The irony of fate is that with the list of "free voters" the Gabriele Pauli comes into the legislature, whose anti-Stoiber appearance the Huber-Beckstein Duo first took advantage of, in order to serve the target politician gracefully.
The CSU leadership now focuses all its forces on stabilizing Beckstein's.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who has so far drawn the strings from the background, will play an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU president called the "most bitter day of his political career" on 28 September.
On Monday, Huber made a few poisonous comments in the direction of CDU - in his view, the CSU would have earned far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which has also contributed much to success at national level in 2005, should not be put back on the ground with a joint power act, Merkel cannot become a Chancellor again after the German Bundestag elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has not made any sense from her disappointment about the Fiasco, believes that the loss of the terrain of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the great coalition in Berlin.
But what is relative is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to rule, and the crisis of the social democrats continues.
At 18.6%, the SPD has achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
In the Sunday elections, no member of the opposition to the Ukrainian Parliament was able to make it.
Russian observers believe that this is due to prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD is suspected of illegality in the count of votes.
The OECD, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognised the elections.
The legitimacy of the 10 million state of the population has been without opposition for decades. However, the "United Democratic Forces" (ODS), which was gathered under the name of "United Democratic Forces" (ODS), has been seriously hoping before yesterday's elections that Lukashenko, who has already renewed his presidential mandate for the fourth time in the unclean elections and thanks to a constitutional change in 2006, would "allow" some members of the opposition in Parliament this time.
This is why the ODS has even removed from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming more and more economically dependent thanks to the increasing prices of natural gas imports from Russia. For the relief of price increases, even loans have been made, and the country has also agreed to the sale of Beltransgas, the owner of the country's leading gas pipeline, to the Russians. In the light of the expectations of the opposition, the hope was that Ukraine would improve its relationship with the EU after Lukashenko and other high-level politicians have banned entry into the EU because of the EU's anti-democratic political system.
The OECD election evaluation report, in which the emphasis was on the positive movements rather than on the shortcomings - such as the exclusion of one third of the opposition candidates from the elections - provided a temporary relaxation.
However, the OECD's rapid report, as early as Monday, criticised the campaign - therefore, opposition people should not be present in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the count of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition can see an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been set free, for example, and Minsk is even prepared to have smaller confrontations with Moscow, by continuing to deny the recognition of the independence of the renegade Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine is a federal state on paper, has been considered independent of the two territories for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has started," said Alexander Milinkevich on our page.
In the view of the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential elections, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have been afraid of leaving only one opposition in Parliament."
The opposition is not planning any protest measures in the light of the results, but rather trying to clarify the need for economic reform to the voters.
"We have many problems here - the opposition newspapers need to be printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting stones in the way of the distribution, but I see that more and more people are supporting change, even the older ones" - said Milinkevich in an allusion that not even the most supported layer of the pensioners agree with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the country's debt and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the" social security "of a cemetery begins to crumble," says Milinkevich.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Community of Independent States, told the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe in the actions and not the words." The lack of opposition is therefore a proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast is served before work"
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi there are rotating doors for the entrance and exit of the officials.
As of today, the measure will come into force against those of the slumps who will only stamp and then go to coffee drinks during working hours.
The new "Anti-Faulpelz" law was presented today by Renato Brunetta, the Minister for Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
">" Rotable doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through a higher presence rate and more services, "said Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism, "Brunetta points out again.
With the Palazzo Chigi the establishment ends in all the buildings of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "The choice of the rotating doors is also of great symbolic value."
There was no resistance from the officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, the cooperation came from all sides."
All in all, therefore, there is no more breakfast during working time; no more coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7: 00 is a miracle."
During a meeting of the Supreme Committee of the Public Administration (Scuola Superior della Pubblica Amministrazione)
The Minister of Rome says that "within three months the absence of officials has been reduced to 50%, that is, 60,000 people per year are more present at work."
He added that it was necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the Italian public administration.
"their wage dynamics - according to the Minister - have been twice the size of the private sector over the last 8-10 years and far above the rate of inflation."
In the meantime, thousands of officials have been working together to counter the Brunetta decree in the context of the vocation supported by Codacon.
"While the Minister of Public Service is profiting with figures on lower absences at work - as the Consumer Centre writes - the people of the 'active lawnmowers' are growing continuously.
Indeed, thousands of correct and valuable civil servants have joined forces to declare war on the illegal standards of the decree. "
In particular, the regional administrative court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related disease, and the planned extension of the mandatory house arrest of the sick worker, during which control visits can be made and further aspects of the Minister's innovations are being challenged.
Napolitano: "Prevention against accidents at work is crucial"
Every day, there are 2500 accidents at work in Italy, three people die, and 27 people remain disabled for life.
For 2007, the data of the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli inforti sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents at work were about 1200.
These figures show the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice the number of deaths that are caused by murders.
Today, the Annil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will be the 58th national day for the victims of accidents at work in all the provinces of Italy, in order to draw the attention of the social institutions and the media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data and the tragic news of these days, published by Anmil, confirm the crucial issue of prevention at work," the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano, in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro), confirmed Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention at the workplace, to protecting the injured workers, to support the families of the victims and to raising public awareness."
"An outraged" Basta "has risen on this; it is understandable in the case of tragedies that, in terms of their size, trigger some invertebrates in the media and public participation. But everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even be repeated in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is in any case also a resource problem: there must be a crucial investment in education and information."
A number of initiatives are particularly important for a more direct awareness of the school framework of young people in the working world.
It is our duty to focus attention on this phenomenon and not to distract it from its social seriousness.
On the one hand, the President of the Chamber of Gianfranco Fini has stressed "how the phenomenon of work-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency, which offends the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work towards determined rules that aim to put an end to the problem."
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight improvement, but this does not exclude that the number of accidents at work is far too high," stresses President of the Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this" positive trend "to mean less attention. This is exactly what causes the tragedy in the end."
"How do you think that you are basically doing too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents? You can fight it through various actions.
In our opinion, greater controls and inspections are necessary - said Mercandelli; but also more measures to inform the workers who are already starting at school. "
"A further effort is needed - he adds - in terms of communication and awareness-raising of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility from employers towards a phenomenon that is a social emergency is needed. "
Mercandelli also came to speak of "the progressive deterioration of protection for the victims of accidents at work," and denounced "the abolition of the social system that we have been fighting against in recent years."
"The aim is therefore to give the worker a guarantee back to insurance so that the fate of the victim of an accident at work does not depend on voluntary or random donations, which are decided from time to time by a legislator."
Mp3 player under charge: danger of hearing damage
To hear loud music over a long period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which, in a report published today in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the Csrseri (Scientific Committee on the current and recently identified health risks) of the EU.
"The report - as it says in a note - makes it clear that 5-10% of those who hear music with portable music equipment for at least five years over an hour a day risk the permanent loss of their hearing."
"I'm worried that such a large number of young people, who usually put portable music equipment and mobile phones on a high volume, will damage their hearing without knowing it irrefutable," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings - it is said by the European Union - there is a clear risk that is pressing for rapid action.
What really matters is to raise consumer awareness and make this information a common good.
In view of these scientific findings, we need to re-examine the existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology. "
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable music equipment among young people.
"The scientists - as the EU communication concludes - confirm that there is a good deal of concern and that the European Commission, together with the other European members and those concerned, will now examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise that comes from portable music equipment and similar equipment."
There is already a European standard that limits the level of noise from portable music equipment to 100 dB, and concerns about the damage that could result from too much noise.
You can very much limit these damage in which you can use solutions such as reducing the volume and length of the noise suspension.
In its report, the European Scientific Committee points out that if the users of portable music equipment hear music only five hours a week (more than 89 decibels), so that the legal limits that apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace are already exceeded.
Those who cross this line risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This is 5-10% of the users of such equipment, the number of which can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the European Union.
Roma, Alemanno launches the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We start today, in March it is to be over, in June it will be taken into account.
This is the course set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome." The Commission met this morning in the new seat behind the Caracalla Therms.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will work out the guidelines for Rome.
As soon as the project is completed, the city and municipal council will assess the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the capital and the mayor Gianni Alemanno in June.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," - stresses Alemanno. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political leaders remain the city and local councils.
There is no redistribution of powers, only the will to have a place where you can develop a great project for Rome.
In March, their task will be over, and the Commission will be disbanding again, as such a project must have a time-determined end point.
In June - the Mayor says - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission. "
Those who call into question the Commission's competence because their opinion is not binding, Alemanno says: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission provides quality results - and this will certainly be the case in Rome - then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics deals with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period in mind, so that in a deeper perspective we can work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city. "
The Mayor of Rome has a great deal to say about the following: "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will make us think. It will employ the best heads of the capital."
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetically nor static in order to enable our city to have a quality leap - which it really needs - and thus to take a joint step in the future."
A future, according to the Mayor of Rome, who "will not only limit himself to the current local borders but will look much further," not only as regards the role of Rome as a metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as a future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean. "
Obama - the first anti-American president? Here is a statement
A well-known American politician, who has much to do with being considered independent, has written: "Barack Obama becomes the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, decimated the US economy and maintained relations with the hostile Islam (and is still doing this as a private man today). "
The attacks against Obama are getting more and more violent, just now that the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote in an Internet page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very naughty: he thinks he will have the highest office of a nation that has seen two black governors and five black senators!. "
In fact, however, these attacks do not have much to say; they are racist attacks and they do not answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; everyone says that Obama will win with a great lead.
Also in this case there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, has written in it in the editorial: only in the election cabin will we know who the real American patriot will give his voice to.
Here comes a mentality of the United States that has been kept hidden until the last.
"Say what you want, then we will decide who we will make our crosses for, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people there who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you never heard before - only now that the success of the black candidate seems so safe.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were questioned: What mistake has Bush made during his term of office? 89% have answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains the majority of Bush's weak point.
The one who will take his place is facing a huge task.
The financial collapse leaves its mark on journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts, and many people accuse the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control regarding the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they were not really concerned about the information concerning the competent authorities because of the general credibility.
They don't feel as alone as they used to be.
The problem for American journalists is the money.
The 2008 crisis is a crisis for these journalists of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the major problems are caused by the reductions in the newsroom, that is, the room in which the editors work to put the newspaper together.
This is a problem that needs to be solved - the interviewed journalists say - if one wants to prevent traditional journalism, as the great public understands, from shrinking significantly.
A clear but complicated pessimism today fills the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors of the press believe that journalism is on the wrong track at national level.
In the local area, the executive is even 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine which direction the web is going in.
The most important publishing groups are on the way to the Internet, which many consider to be the "killer" of the press.
The "economic pressure" that the journalists feel has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to joining the new technology in the hope of "bringing something good for journalism."
The biggest crack is in American journalism today between the chief editors of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of the managers at national level are certain that their reporters share their values with them, while at local level it is only 23%.
Some think it has to do with "safety in work."
The managers who are afraid of losing their work within three years are 47% at national level.
It's 30% for the journalists.
The theme of "safe work" in the team (our "editors," Anm. d. Red.) is always a current issue in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation, as it are the US, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV channels and Internet operators, employers offer as it is popular to them and so it becomes a question of take it or leave it.
The chief editors get very often very high wages, while the editor can sometimes only get 10000 euros per month, including pension and insurance funds.
As far as the holiday is concerned, the matter is complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 holiday days after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, as they themselves admit, often become "sick" in the course of the year.
It's a question of climate.
UNIPOL: RURAL REPORT: DANILO COPPOLA BLEIBT IN GREAT ATERRATA
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the real estate agent's request, which had asked to be moved from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is established against Coppola for bankruptcy in the context of the counter-agreement investigation in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl..
In the course of the trial against him during the last week, his release from the house arrest was converted into a residence obligation to Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be moved from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such transfers (against which the prosecutor's office had expressed itself) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and to get to him an indictment of evidence.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already been revealed a few days ago when the House of Representatives voted against the White House's 700 billion-dollar savings package: a large part of the Americans were and are more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This confirms yesterday's issue of the New York Times, which reports on how the crisis in the run-up to the Republican party, which is increasingly divided into its old and moderate East Coast soul, has always favoured the state institutions and the business community and those neoconservative who are hostile to "those in Washington" and the financial world, and who, in the south and the centre of the states, are gaining voters.
This part of the party owes its rise to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
This example, however, has just been mentioned, is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake has announced or is already happening: not only in the United States, but also in the whole of the West, and perhaps beyond them will be affected by it.
The crisis seems to accelerate the long-feared events in both the countries and in Europe, which are finally taking shape and coming to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the unheard Renaissance of the state in conjunction with a kind of renationalisation of the economy.
In fact, the crisis is a decline in the banking and financial institutions, which have close links with foreign countries and at the same time manage a huge amount of the assets of private households living in a single state.
This is a direct political problem for governments: the way in which families are to be treated, which are also a huge majority of voters.
The crisis therefore appears economically global, but politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have come to an end in itself and lost its right to speak: the EU has given an insight into this, which, because of its division into different national and international conflicts, is not able to find a common path.
Therefore, everyone now expects the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and, in particular, the distribution of aid funds: since the crisis has become more and more serious, only the US is in the economic situation to save itself without any foreign aid.
And in addition to the resources, they also have the legitimacy to use them: therefore, two conditions which cannot be overestimated - under certain circumstances - which, otherwise, will not be able to use an international organisation or a market in a similar way.
The new emphasis placed on the state-national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever-greater importance that has recently been associated in the economy with a most closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically, just now, when we were so convinced that we had long entered a network of all-around, a realm of increasingly differentiated technologies, of immaterial, that we must at once see how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
These can certainly be transported from one place to another in the world, but are still connected to an extremely closely defined piece of earth - a territory.
That is why the one who has such a territory is in favour of another, who lives in a non-harvesting, water-free or oil-free area.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a short introduction.
Those who have territory, those who have government, those who say politics, also say leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to create two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leadership ships, that is, the need for someone who knows how to handle things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation about the existing leaders, namely those of the economy, who have turned out to be insufficient and full of shadow zones.
In addition, there is a deeper and more worrying aspect: a loss of confidence, impatience, an image of inefficiency, a sense of distance, all of which is directed at a whole class of Western managers.
It seems to be the belief that, among large parts of the population, it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their ideas, their Way of Life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is the majority as ever more foreign and more surpassed.
The demand for leadership thus nourishes underground a branched but powerful movement of the deeming of the leading class and the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseeable "revolts" of the voters and in the unmediated reversal of the collective state of mind of the past: starting with the rise of the Conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, over the collapse of the Labour Party in Great Britain, towards the rebellion of the American Members against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the rights in Italy also plays a role here).
You get the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and more understanding problems and therefore less representative of what is happening today in the lower social strata of the West and is being driven by the financial crisis even more and up to the overdimensionality.
In view of all this, it would be simply excessive to speak of a "rebellion of the masses."
But keeping the eyes wide open is certainly not.
The superglue that makes the walls go up
To defeat the forces of gravity thanks to a adhesive and to climb up walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which is now almost the target.
With a glue applied on an area of only 2.5 square cm, the researchers managed to fix a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO - an American magazine has published the results of the researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material found by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be seen as a series of spaghetti-ordered tubes," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the gecko, which are covered by microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect hold.
The tests carried out with different materials such as glass teflon and abrasive paper have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger than the holding capacity of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time "easy to remove from the wall," says Liming Dai, researcher of the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
"This material could be used as a transitory adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
For example, how to emport Spiderman on walls? Maybe so, but the researchers think of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also heads of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application may fall within the field of space.
So for the moment, the superheroes still have to wait.
The other kind of research - also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of glue.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, the Californian scientists present a microfibre adhesive that, like hair, purifies itself from the dust by moving on a surface and thus always maintain a perfect liability.
Medicines: never take with fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed due to their refreshing quality and their vitamin diversity in the summer, may cause serious health damage if they are taken at the same time as certain vital medicines, as they may have an extreme effect on the absorption of these by the body.
David Bailey, Professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points out the risk of packed and fresh fruit juices in connection with drug intake. In the course of the 236. Meetings of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he once again struck the alarm: a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is enough to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital medicines to the extent that they are practically eliminated and thus the health of patients is at risk.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some medicines such as antibiotics, antiasthma, cardiovascular medicines, anxiolytic and neurological agents, to toxic levels.
MEDIKAMENTE IN FAIR - In a report two years ago, the same agency of the medicine had warned doctors and patients about the dangers of this mix, and stressed the need to pay attention to what is being drunk in conjunction with means such as diazepan or metadone.
It is NOT just Grapefruit - According to the experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the medicines.
The list of active substances inhibited by fruit juices is long.
This is why the call from Michele Carruba, the director of the Università Statale di Milano, said: "Such results are usually forwarded immediately to the various international producers who are so free to change consumer information.
It is therefore appropriate to always read the package leaflet and, if there are any uncertainties, to ask a pharmacist or a doctor, "the expert of the Ansa Agency stresses.
The Nobel Economic Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Economic Prize is to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at the University of Princeton and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the largest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in a New York Times editorial that this second event was crucial to the history of the United States than the attacks.
A prediction that received not little polemics in response and was held to the economist years later, but today proves to be completely correct.
"I am surprised and also shocked at the rapid disappearance of the memory of the scandals in the context of the collapse of Enron or Worldcom from the public perspective," said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economist of great value," but also a banalizer with a "very aggressive style, which is particularly directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush government."
Open Office, the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package appears
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the Open Source Software, as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office, is gaining an ever-increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among the public and public authorities.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers, which is monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself to the audience with some new features: in addition to a revised and now Spartan-designed starting menu, a basic compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x is finally reached, as well as the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, that is the latest standard ISO version.
In addition, the compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, the new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Some new features are also interesting, such as those that allow the size of PowerPoint presentations to be reduced, which makes it easier to send by email, for example. This includes the possibility to import PDF files into graphics processing modules while at the same time preserving the original appearance of the page.
Thus, "hybrid" PDF files can now be generated, which extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format to include the elements of a table and a text processing system.
The cooperation is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be processed on a multiple basis by different users, thus avoiding conflicts in the event of changes; in the case of the text processing system, a questionnaire is assigned to each processor in order to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some companies are currently publishing various functions of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while the final result will be published in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available on the following link for download: http: / / it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download300.html. This is followed by the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
The program is also available for the Linux operating system except for Windows and Mac OS.
On request, you can send the installation CD home or office.
However, if freedom of charge can be an incentive for the dissemination of the programme in private households, it is also in the business sector where OpenOffice could succeed in the big throw: after all, several public administration and schools have already moved to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of training offer, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text setting program; Calc, the table program, which aims at the displacement of Excel; Impress, for the creation of presentations such as PowerPoint; Dbase for the use of databases instead of the more well-known access; and last but not least, draw, a graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads - a target that can also be slightly exceeded in the already reached 3 million and 600 thousand.
Kohl also tested positive and thus the fourth doping case
It opens a new Dopingfall mi framework of the past Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, who is the third-class and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news was published by the daily L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner is the fourth driver, who was tested positively for Cera, the third generation epo. Previously, this was the case with the Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from the blood samples of Kohl are among those carried out by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories in the last few weeks.
If the countersamples now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place and will be excluded from the races for two years.
The head of the French anti-doping commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive Epottest, and according to the Associated Press also notify the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian rose to the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber for himself.
THEME CHANGE: THE NEW YORK TIMES QUESTION: IS ITALY RASISISTIC?
Italy, "the former country of emigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants," which are only taken up with reluctance.
Is this a nation of racist people from Belpaese? This is what the New York Times is asking in a long article dedicated to the subject of racism in Italy, which is based on the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after he stole a pack of cookies from Burkina Faso.
The case shows what the times call "the paradox of the North": the northern regions are those where "the most integration and work opportunities" exist, but still "the highest degree of anti-immigration sentiments and the largest support for the Lega North."
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the times are based on further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation against immigration introduced by the Lega and the faster expulsion of illegal immigrants is also mentioned as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement, which the Pope and the President of the Republic also stress: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope to cooperate with the Church and the State to fight racism at a meeting on the Quirinal."
Students Victims of up to 900 Euro per room high rental prices
The market for apartments for students does not know any crises.
According to the last study of the Sunia, the rental union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious features. The whole range of students lose their right to study in such a way that their families are unable to support them at this level" - said Sunia, Laura Mariani - "in these cities, the great demand from students leads to a deformation of the market that has also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most of the rent offers include a number of infringements: free contracts, missing registrations, no rent price limit, unauthorized underrent.
For the Sunia there is a need for exceptional measures, which result in lower rental prices through a revision of the tax.
The study shows that in Milan a sleeping area in the Brianza area is needed about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Bande Nere district) and ends with 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera district or even 900 euros in the Vittoria area.
In Florence, a sleeping area costs an average of 350 / 400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where the students concentrate in the quarters around the university, there are 250 / 280 euros for a place to sleep, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the quarters around the university are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping area in a double room.
Only a little deeper are the rent in the quarters around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who emigrate in outdoor areas can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping area and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centacelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping area, for one room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive quarters, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a sleeping area costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350 euros.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more common, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a 25-30% higher than average rent is required by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso - the cities close their historical cinema halls
The historical cinemas close due to the beneficiary multiplex cinemas.
"A city without cinema is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This picture of the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is currently happening in the large urban centres of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multiroom complex in the periphery, means in the long term death for the single-room cinema in the centre. A process that does not only seem inevitable and irrevocable, but also bears the traits of a cultural crime.
"It is like losing a friend with whom you have laid a piece of street full of emotions," says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso," who brought him the Oskar and the Grand Prix of Cannes 20 years ago. It is the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a well-lost cinema world.
The figures provided by the Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: in the last five years, the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; the majority of these have paid cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions include Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This shows that the main culprits are the multiplexkinos, because they are just these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: at 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy has been leading the lists, 81 are both in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, the president of the Anec, "it is useful that new structures also arise, but the first thing is to maintain the existing one, because a room in the city is closed, not all of its regular customers are ready to visit a multiplexino in the periphery instead of the old one.
And here the missing budget for the association's fund remains outside of eight: the debt burden recorded by the state is about EUR 10 million.
It is a shame from the ethical-moral point of view that the government does not respect the existing laws.
To maintain the sector would be between 16 and 18 million euros a year of need. "
The case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which has decided to protect it by means of an agreement between the municipality and the Anec due to the fears of the old cinema, is the first such agreement in Italy to protect and support traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
The measures envisaged include tax incentives for cinema operators as well as benefits for the public in terms of local transport: it will be possible to drive to the traffic-limited areas of the centre and to park at more favourable parking charges.
"It is a pleasant initiative," said Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join us and also develop new concepts.
But we certainly need better audio and video equipment to be able to do something against the superpower of the multiplex rooms, because the audience of today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema has always been an important issue for me: the closure of the "supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the crucial point that made me start the "Nuovo cinema paradise," even though I had been playing with the thought for 10 years.
For 25 years I have lived in Rome; if I pass by the Rialto or the Quirinale in Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn my side to not have to see the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was ready to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group.
The accusations made by the lawyer of the Antimafia Authority of Calabria against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for mafia business, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the older intermediary between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew, was also taken in handcuffs: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been sentenced to a compensation of 10 million euros for the involvement in criminal associations of the Mafia.
"Abhor any kind of moral and legal standard," the lawyers say, "the two local administrations had decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for consulting activities."
"Thus it was made possible for the Mafia group - the judges - to enter the city hall on an official basis and to participate in the policy of public administration."
The President of the Calabria Regional Committee Agazio Loiero does not deny that in his region it is "anything but an exception to meeting links from local administrations and organised crime." "There are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others in which such connections are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who get a white vest. "
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, with which, according to the police, the clan Piromalli was beheaded.
Since the end of the last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 - and also at that time due to alleged links between organised crime and the local administration - the local politicians of their municipal offices had been removed.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then Mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the Central Law Coalition in May 2006.
He screamed scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He was involved in the vice-minister Marco Minniti, who he accused of having invented everything for political-strategic reasons, but the judges explained this morning's arrest warrant that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request a change to the A3 project.
A detour in the context of the investigations into the case of Dal Torrione has shown the willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli - which made the public administration measures identical to the interests of that clan. "
When the energy comes out of the waves, the big ones suddenly run up
It is a non-fading source of money that covers more than 70% of the planet's surface and only now seems to understand this by the great energy companies in the world.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that are now all looking at, and are also looking to occupiate, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of gaining energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and investigated for 70 years, and these studies have not been significantly intensified since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil broke in around 1980, the idea of marine energy was lost, but now the environmental organisations and the increased price of oil are pushing for new impetus in this sector.
The World Energy Council in London estimates that 15% of the world's energy needs could be covered by the energy produced by the ocean waves.
This would be equal to double the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
The currents and tides would also be added.
Giants in the attack.
The first company that now relies on marine energy is Enersis, who signed a contract in 2005 for the construction of a power plant in northern Portugal.
When this message was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are now more and more companies from the traditional energy industry that rely on marine energy production.
"Chevron is investigating these technologies," says the spokesperson of a company known to the American giants in the Wall Street Journal, and is considering the possibility of working with us. "
This is about obtaining an authorisation from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a not-to-be-underestimated sign, given that, in Alaska, oil is still being promoted by the US and President Bush has recently launched the plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; if the details are not known, observers are talking about an increasing interest.
Even better-looking technologies.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still in progress, not least because the last doubts have not yet been resolved by the environmentalists.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of a rather small dimension and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, in order to produce large-scale energy, technologies with far greater environmental impact are needed.
There are various ways: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of connected bojen.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the bowls up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the swimmers via flasks and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity is sent to the coast via underwater lines.
So far there are four planned installations of this kind, which are only waiting for state approval. Part of the energy obtained could also be used for military facilities.
Verdant Power, however, already produces energy for a building of goods and a parking lot with the help of underground turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which feed the generator through the resulting rotation.
According to Verdant, a long line of potential clients is waiting for the necessary authorisations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Power-winning Research, a special interest is currently worthy of the potential that is in the tides.
Although this is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are better predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and also waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
It is precisely the tidal energy that led states such as New York, Maine and Alaska and other coastal states to invest $7.5 million in 2008 - up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
