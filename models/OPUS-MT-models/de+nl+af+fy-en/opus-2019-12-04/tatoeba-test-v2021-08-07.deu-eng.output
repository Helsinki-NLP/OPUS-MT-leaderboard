The main task of the kings was to build a tomb, of which one thought it would seem as timeless as the stars would appear above the sand of the time in which everything else went wrong. The planning of the afterlife was more important than the life itself, which was only the way to it. Wars led them to remember the walls of this tomb, in which stone the scenes were carved, in which it was a great deal of time, and in the later times, many battles were even presented that had not taken place.
The main, property, front and middle words are declared; however, the words are conjugated.
