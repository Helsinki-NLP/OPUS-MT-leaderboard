Gutach: More safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters away from each other: on Tuesday the new B 33 pedestrian lamp at the village parking lot has been put into operation in Gutach - in sight of the older town hall.
Two facilities so close to each other: intention or tortoise?
This question was clearly answered by Gutach's mayor yesterday.
"The town hall sample was installed at that time because it secured the school path," explained Eckert yesterday.
The Kluser traffic light ensures both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The plant that was officially in operation yesterday was important for the intersection area of Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area › Grub ‹.
"At the high traffic and pedestrian level, another traffic light had to come to their safety," Eckert said.
This also confirms Peter Arnold of the District Council Offenburg.
"According to current measurements, on the B 33, about 12,000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach, of which about ten percent are heavy-duty traffic," stresses Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic light was more than necessary: "Safety is simply going on here," Arnold said.
A total of four traffic shows were carried out, a circular traffic was also considered, but again rejected because of the narrow in the intersection area of Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße.
According to Arnold, everything was tested before in the location selection of the traffic light masts: "By means of an extra transporters loaded with particularly long wooden rods, we have tested whether these vehicles can go from the sulzbachweg to the B 33 without the traffic light masts being cut."
The 15 000 euro traffic light system itself is the "most modern of what is currently on the market," said Arnold.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs that are so powerful that the lights of the car drivers can be seen well, for example, even in the case of deep sun.
And it is also economical: the older light systems use about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
There are three light systems per direction of journey.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian pushes the light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is free, the green comes directly for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be completed for the pedestrian.
"If a group or disabled people go across the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will be safe on the road," said Arnold.
Of course, the driver has to think here as a partner and watch the track.
This was not the case yesterday: Hardly showed the light for pedestrians green, a top-class vehicle smoked through - in light red.
For more than 30 years Josef Winkler has been writing the need for his childhood and youth of the soul.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village child - the lack of speech, the tendency to roar violence and blunt sexuality, the narrow and unjoyful - have often been described by the Carinthia poet.
The Büchner Prize winner is known especially as a prosaauthor, theatrical texts are rar in his work.
Collage from Prosatext Gerhard Fresacher sets up a collage of Prosatext for his performance "Weather Lights on the Züngenspitze," which is now to be seen in the garage X at Peterplatz, therefore a collage of Prosatext.
The theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) with prosaminiatur from "Leichnam, his family," (2003).
On the largely empty stage - important request: a broken sofa on which the eight-headed ensemble is clearly copied and masturbated - is hanging through the text material.
The director, Fresacher, seems to have little faith in the text.
The 70-minute performance overtones the template with a wealth of government intakes, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic play forms.
The actresses, in particular, come up with some of the somewhat questionable szenical transformations.
They are hard-touched, with their heads dipped under water, with their evening grapes on the wall.
Embed in cell ophan or millet, they strike at dangerously high sticks through the production, either monologize them loudly or lie completely mute on the stage floor.
The text, however, is hardly communicated in this way.
The best moments have the evening when singing - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular song.
At the end of the show, the overturned performance is a little quiet, and Winkler's next-door absurd sense of humor is flashes.
A blackbox in the car?
American street planners are looking for a money source to repair the falling highway system, and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that can be found in the dashboard of every car.
The equipment that records every kilometre and reports the information to the authorities is at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the states to revise the outdated system of financing US roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly created an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Liberals have joined environmental groups and are in favour of the government being able to use the small boxes to record the kilometres that have been taken - and possibly where they have been driven - and then use the information for the calculation of tax documents.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of concerns about data protection.
But while there is no agreement in Congress on an action, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how they can change over the next ten years to a system in which drivers pay per mile.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
"It is nothing that we will only possibly use," said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the miles we've been driving with all the California drivers in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for that is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed from the taxes, is to pay the US Americans at the Zapfzäule, is bankrupt.
But in America, it's not as much gas as it used to be.
Cars use less gas.
The state oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax even to raise a cent at high injection prices.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert in transport legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
"This is the most useful long-term alternative," he said.
The bureaucrats call it a mile-based user touch.
It is not surprising that the idea is in favour of urban liberals, because the tax could, for example, be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce congestion and climate-harmful exhaust gases.
The California planners are relying on the system to develop strategies to achieve the state's ambitious, legally anchored objectives for climate change.
But the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees it as the most common long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also well aware of the idea of having drivers pay for the distance.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, Vice-President of the Reason Guidelines.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers who in a report in 2011 asked Congress to move towards mile-based settlement.
The US Senate approved last year a $90 million expensive pilot project, which would have included 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the advance and thus responded to the concerns of people from rural areas who represent people who often have to spend many miles on the way to work or to the city in everyday life.
Several states and major cities are still on their own moving in this direction.
The most committed is Oregon, which currently acquires 5,000 drivers for the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the mile fees instead of the oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering this.
Illinois is testing it with trucks to a limited extent.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently examining how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers were equipped with the equipment, drivers were sceptical about the idea that the government could pursue any of its movements.
"Concern about Big Brother and such things were a big problem," explains Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Result Management at the Ministry of Transport of Nevada.
People didn't want it.
When the test started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into adult surveillance devices."
There is no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology with which the state can capture the miles that have been taken, but not exactly when and where.
So, Khan, the public would be more calm.
The search for this technology has led some authorities to a small start-up company called True Milage in California.
The company has not originally started to help states with the taxation of drivers.
Instead, it was their goal to enter an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers are to pay on the basis of the miles they are driving.
But the devices she tested are also interesting for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide limited information that is regularly uploaded by modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Milage.
Some of these public pilot programmes have made major mistakes.
There are much cheaper and less intuitive ways of implementing this.
In Oregon, the planners experiment to give drivers a range of choice options.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose a device at all and instead pay a flat-rate fee based on the average miles of all the inhabitants of the state.
Other bodies hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by providing the equipment with more functions than other functions.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a tax-free device that can also be used to pay parking charges, to pay insurance only for miles gone by and to collect speed data from other vehicles in real time, which will allow drivers to avoid congestion.
"Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system," says a city planning document.
However, some transport planners wonder whether all the talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials said that Congress could simply solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by increasing fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or annual charge could be imposed on car drivers using hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little petrol, so that they also pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient," explains Randy Rentschler, the Commission's legislative and public affairs director.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers are worried about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Small team is wakey
The volunteer fire department managed its fall main test despite the lack of personnel with Bravour.
Only 11 men took part in the exercise.
In his practice, the department commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the estate of Feder in Burgberger Straße.
A short circuit is said to have been created during the sawing.
Two people were injured by the fire and the smoke development, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
After the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two anti-aircraft carriers of the Wehr made themselves ready to enter the building.
After a short time, it was possible to find the first person and to go to the open.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, as a narrow staircase was also to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stables for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and straw balls in it.
There were also electric machines for working wood.
The first fire attack was carried out via the tank in the vehicle.
A further line was made via an overfloor hydrante about 100 meters away.
Now three fire attacks could be designed.
A hollow-beam tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also about to show what to do with little available staff during the exercise.
In the event of a serious event, support will be provided through the daily work group Königsfeld.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies important
On his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, President Guido Wolf was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt of where the workers of tomorrow come from.
In the Hochschwarzwald Development Centre he, together with the managers of the vocational schools and the district gymnasium and the parents' advisory board, examined this important question.
"Education is an important location factor," said Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma-School, who presented the network school project Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the promotion centre, the district school and the vocational school centre in the Walderstadt.
He also praised the family friendliness in the district.
"It is important not only to have a look at the family phase, but also, as a result of demographic change, the period of care for family members," said Wolf.
He also pointed out that more and more employees were taking care of the care and care of their families.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship," said Wolf.
But no one could afford to lose qualified labour, he said.
Another particularly important factor was the networking of universities and companies.
"For those who have already learned the benefits of the region during their studies, with their acquired knowledge and skills, often remain in the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," the President of the country was convinced.
It is only if sufficient training places are offered that the needs of the skilled can also be met.
In his opinion, the site advantage of the district is its beneficial location in the south-west of Germany, in the immediate vicinity of France and Switzerland.
On his train trip from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he also experienced the efforts already made to develop public passenger transport.
"Stay persistent and ensure that public transport is better," he explained to the local politicians present.
With music experienced a fun afternoon
For 15 years the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger seniors to coffee, cakes and then to a Vesper.
In the past, the older fellow citizens were visited in the resting place.
In the meantime, this afternoon is held in the nursing home of St. Joseph.
The locals were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later, there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father, Karl Kimmich, were in the middle of the series.
The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall is to be added to the renovation plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the kilbig, a small wall was installed in the first work of the reconstruction of the front school, to stabilize and static discharge of the over a hundred-year-old natural stone wall with Balustrade.
The further approach is to include Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt in the plans and to create a new concept for the old wall.
A cost calculation will then be made by experts who will then be put on the table to the local council for the decision and determination of the further action.
A decision on this is expected to be taken in the coming year.
After the renovation, paving and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, it is necessary to be in the foreseeable future as a follow-up measure, the need for a rejuvenation of the barrier wall from the ground up and put it on a new base.
The historic, one hundred-year-old border wall of the old school to the Kirchstraße, is mainly due to water and frost damage, as there is no drainage, need to be remedied and has a bow inclination forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones bear witness to weather damage, but the wall is currently not at risk of collapse.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for one of the students using a school yard, which has been done by the current fortifications.
Originally, the school was already planned in 2008 / 2009, but high unplanned expenditure brought a shift.
An important word in the historical school wall renovation, which was even used for film recordings, will be spoken by the National Memorial Office.
If regulations come from this side, the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the monuments.
The students of the Bräunlinger primary school, who are now again taught in a well-renovated old school building with new aula, can soon use the old school yard.
Özdemir wants to get jazz training in Stuttgart
In the ongoing discussions on the future of the music schools in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, the Federal President of the Greens, has now been involved.
"I think it is wrong to give up the holistic training at the Stuttgart University of Music," said Özdemir, "Stuttgart News."
Jazz and classical music are just part of the jazz location Stuttgart.
In this way, Özdemir, who in Stuttgart is a favorite for a direct mandate in the Bundestag election on 22 September, is opposed to the Green-Red State Government.
On the basis of an expert study, this forces a rearrangement of the five music schools in Baden-Württemberg.
After that, the Jazz and Pop course will be transferred from the Stuttgart Music School to the Mannheim Music School.
US border: "Super Tunnel" to the drug smuggling discovered
On the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators have discovered and shut down a "super tunnel" to the drug smuggling.
As reported by the US customs authorities, the more than 500-metre-long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railway tracks and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were therefore arrested, eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine seized.
The tunnel had not yet been used.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they can dig through under the radar," said the U.S. State Attorney General of Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where this was discovered one end of the tunnel.
Duffy said, "If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a long-term fight against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Designed by experts
Because of the complex equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track system was equipped in such a way that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is in a building 80 meters from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters in height and 90 centimeters in width.
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the US.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund.
The third, a Mexican, was caught for the confiscated marijuana.
All three of them are at risk of life-long imprisonment, as officials said.
Since 2006 eight such tunnels have been discovered, it was said at the press conference in San Diego.
But it was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel building.
Usually, cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the "despair" of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the drug investigation DEA in San Diego.
You'd do anything to get to the United States.
No details were given to the prisoners, at least one of them was Mexican, they said.
You have to expect prison sentences of up to ten years.
2014 Geisinger will be the festival year
The Jubilee of the City of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
Returning the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer.
When the year ends in about eight weeks, the anniversary year is up.
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were first mentioned together in 794.
In churches a document was made in which both places are mentioned.
On March 15, there will be an official start to the anniversary year, and since there is no hall at the moment, this opening event will take place in the place where both were mentioned for the first time in 1250 years ago, in church houses.
In the course of the anniversary, a number of events are planned both in geesingen and in church houses.
The church house will be the 1250 in July at a weekend from July 18 to 20.
Celebrate your return.
On Friday with a feast, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the church hall.
On this weekend there is also the church-house church festival.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which is listed on three dates.
On June 21 together with the Sunday celebration of the Black Forest Association, on July 12 in the Arena with fireworks and on December 13 as the first concert of the city music in the new festival hall.
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is on the last September weekend, on September 27 and 28.
On the occasion of the Geisinger City Jubilee, a new chronicle is also being published.
"But it is to be a chronicle not only by geisingen themselves, but a printed work on the geisingen of today, which is made up of geisingen, church houses, body things, aulfingen and gutmadingen," says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And the hostage of today also celebrates its birthday in 2014, in 1974 today's space was completed with the communities.
The new chronicle will be presented in the new hall in Geisingen on November 21 or 22.
2014 is also another year with many anniversaries.
The Narrenzöft Strohglonki starts on February 8 with a bridal evening on the occasion of its 60-year-old existence, the Harmony Gutmadingen becomes 90 years and on March 29 has the banquet and then celebrates the district music festival from May 1 to 4.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen becomes 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on May 10, the music club Polyhymnia Leipferdingen becomes 150 years old and celebrates this in the context of the fountain festival from July 4 to 7.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a gift certificate owned by the monastery of St. Gallen in 764.
The certificate was made in churches (Hausen), which was then a court square.
Both municipalities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
Because of this 1250 year old to celebrate in 2014, in addition the municipality reform is 40 years ago.
Council looks at track systems
Should the railway crossing "Am Hirschen" be redesigned in a complex way to increase road safety?
Yes, the local councils have decided.
Schiltach has to take up 220 000 euros for this.
The Deutsche Bahn intends to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
In particular, the safety of rail crossings is to be increased - there is a regular collision of trains with other vehicles across the country.
If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they must participate with one third in the costs, the rest share the railway and the federal government.
Schiltach's city builder Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipal council the special features of the railway crossing "Am Hirschen."
There, the city plans to build an outpost at the level of the tunnel mundes to the west of the railway track.
There could also be larger vehicles, such as those that transport long wood, in the case of counter-traffic without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could spread the following road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversial in the municipal council, as some councils questioned the need to spread the road: Thomas Kipp, with his statement, brought the spirit of critics to the point: "Do we have to take so much money in our hands because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas opposed: The railway crossing "Hirschen" is used regularly for long-wood transport.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is partially transported over this route because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the line at the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn to the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a redirection for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed, Haas argued.
As it can be seen that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels need to be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "Am" could also have an important traffic significance for a longer period of time.
The Council agreed to examine the costs of the planned expansion of the road.
Notwithstanding this, the majority of the members agreed to the redesign of the railway crossing on the condition that the necessary support wall is built in such a way that the city could, where appropriate, extend the following road towards "Bahnhofstraße" for meeting traffic to about 5.5 meters.
By contrast, the conversion of the railway crossing at the Gerberei Trautwein could lead to a very different problem, which concerns access to the very increasing "Geroltzhäuser Weg."
The administration had had the railway redesign plans examined by the engineering firm Brainlinger, as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Wegs was then easily possible.
The investigation concluded that it was not possible to rule out that the road's propensity could lead to longer vehicles.
The city is again responsible for this as a road-building carrier.
The change could therefore lead to disputes of liability.
As both the wood drain and the turn-off worked in the current state of development, one should not agree to the redesign of the railway crossing, Haas argued.
The risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition was also significantly lower at this point than at the other train crossings, because the centre stop is right next to the centre to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main station would have to be at this point to the extent that there is no threat of collision.
The majority of the members refused to accept the change of the train, as the city of Schiltach had to "bathe" the problem with the vehicles that were sitting, "said the councils, as the railway could withdraw from the responsibility after the construction was completed.
The body considers the changes to the "Vorn Heubach" and "Vorn Kuhbach" railway crossing, for which cross-agreements have already been made with the railway.
Esa decides on major space missions: missions for billions
Far-off planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the coming years.
30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Far worlds.
More than 1000 planets on other stars have already found astronomers.
No one knows if there are lives on at least some of them.
The selection is difficult: do you want to look for gravitational waves?
Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or have you been looking for Earth-like planets and perhaps discover alien life?
These questions are being raised by the European Space Agency, Esa.
For their "Cosmic Vision" programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects to make research a major contribution.
The budget for such "L-missions" is about one billion euros each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were the subject of debate, five of which have now come to the closer choice.
A large number of bodies review the proposals and follow up with the researchers.
In the next few days a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
A total of four major questions have been selected by the Esa, to which the missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme launched in 2007 will find answers.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and lives?
The exact processes of the creation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also of planets that surround these stars - are still in the proverbial dark.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this dark.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to address this question, the space telescope "Cheops" will be launched in 2017, with which 500 already known planetary systems will be examined in more detail in our near environment.
The possibilities are limited, however, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, the astronomers could depict earth-like planets and even analyse the composition of their atmospheres and thus look for "biomarkers": gases that are considered as an indication of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, is intended to provide an overview of the conditions for the creation of life.
The magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation it causes with the planet system play an important role.
In our solar system, these processes can be examined in an exemplary way.
With the "Solar Orbiter," the Esa has already approved a M-Class mission (there the budget is about half a billion euros) for this issue.
The probe is to start in 2017 and closely monitor the surface and activity of the sun.
The researchers are also of great interest to Jupiter and his moons.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
For this purpose, the Esa provides the first of the three L-missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme.
The Juice probe (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to start its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, she reaches Jupiter and is to study the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moon of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and to study whether the laws of nature known to us are still valid there.
It may also be possible to find differences that could lead the physicists to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be united.
How did the universe come into being and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos were created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the matter we are familiar with, which consists of stars, planets and living beings as we are, there are dark matter, whose gravity holds together galaxies and galaxies, and dark energy, through which the expansion of the universe accelerates.
So far, the researchers do not know what physical laws were valid in the first few seconds of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With "Euclid," the Esa has already approved a M mission here, which is scheduled to start in 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time throughout the sky and thus allow for conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could do the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will be left at the end of the selection process.
According to many experts "E-Lisa," the best chance of obtaining an L-mission is a demanding concept for the detection of gravitational waves.
These include changes in the structure of space time, which Albert Einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been shown to this day.
Elisa could do this, hoping the scientists behind the project.
The mission provides for a detector consisting of two or three probes, which is stationed in space.
Unlike plants on Earth, it could also demonstrate gravitational waves that were created during the Big Bang and thus provide new insights about the origin of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L-mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena," which is to explore black holes, "Icy Planets," another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism," a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder," which is to detect and investigate earth-like planets.
There are already proposals for the return of samples from Mars, for the exploration of the moon, Venus and asteroids, as well as for solar physics.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany regarding US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the Whistleblower of the US intelligence service, said he was ready to go to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag when the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give answers to their activities.
The German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he received asylum to discuss the statement with him in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, presented to the media on Friday by Ströbelle in Berlin, he writes: "Even though the result of my efforts has been proven to be positive, my government continues to treat a different opinion as a breach of faith and tries to criminalize political expression with a criminal threat, in which no defence is possible."
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American government to drop the charge against him.
The charge brought by the US Ministry of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property.
German Minister of the Interior Hans-Peter Friedrich said on-line: "If Mr Snowden is ready to speak with German representatives, then we will find ways to make this possible."
The US-Germany relations are burdened by the allegations that the NSA has heard the phone from Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the Member who runs the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service, said that we should take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness if this was possible "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the US."
Ströbelle, a member of the Green Group, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbelle said that according to the lawyer of former NSA employee Snowden, he would not be able to return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden testified in Germany, he would need a guarantee that he was "safe" there, said the Member.
Snowden explains in his letter that he saw himself in a "serious and ongoing" persecution campaign that had driven him out of his home country.
However, it was touched by the global response to "my act of political expression."
Citizens around the world as well as high-level politicians - including in the United States - have described the revelations of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive monitoring as a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden makes an offer of cooperation to the German authorities "when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been solved."
Frontier Airlines charges for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to 100 US dollars of passengers who want to store hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to 100 US dollars for a piece of hand luggage and 2 dollars for coffee or lemonade, even though the announcement on Wednesday was that passengers should keep the whole can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier said that if the fee is paid in advance, you can calculate 25 US dollars and 100 US dollars for travellers who only paid on the airway.
Frontier speaker Kate O'Malley said that the $100 charge is aimed at moving travellers, taking care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to calculate this amount," she said.
Airlines started to charge for the first and second piece of luggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid it have therefore put as much in the hand luggage as possible, which means that the luggage compartments above the seat are often overfilled.
Fees are one way to move passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee is not really about making money.
It is about the most faithful customers of Frontier who would have clearly expressed that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find place in the field above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may take a piece of luggage free of charge at the airport of Frontier, but the next person will have to pay 100 dollars for a similar piece of luggage.
O'Malley said that the Frontier website and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers were informed about the fee before they came to the airport.
The new hand luggage fee from Frontier will only enter into force in the summer, a precise date is not yet available.
Passengers often complain about luggage charges and other charges, but airlines are happy to take advantage of it.
They argue that the transport of the luggage costs money and passengers should pay this service if they wanted it.
Many on Wall Street consider the new baggage charges to be a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the costs of air travel after years of losses.
Most of them, however, have so far left the fingers of charges for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first to charge hand luggage three years ago and later Allegiant Air, also a cheap plane.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who is closely following the additional charges.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the hand-luggage fee would bring in Spirit 50 million dollars a year.
Sorensen, who previously held a leading position at Midwest Airlines, has recently flown with Spirit and was curious what would expect him on the platform if passengers were confronted with the unusual hand luggage fee of the company.
"The boarding process was one of the most smooth I've seen in my career in aviation," he said.
I was expecting to see no sign of it, and some very tangible discussions on the airway.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding was running like lubricated."
Frontier also follows spirit with the 2 dollars that are required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company said that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep the whole can and coffee is refilled free of charge.
Water is still free.
US Airways had tried for a short time in 2008 to ask for money for refreshments, but did this again seven months later after passengers had complained and no other large company had been involved.
Frontier's step to charge the hand luggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to guide customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket sold.
This provides an incentive for all companies to move passengers to buy directly from them rather than via an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone the far-reaching in this area.
In September, the company started to award only half as many miles of flights when booking via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were reduced to 25 percent of the route.
A flight trip with Frontier over 1000 miles booked with a third party is therefore only 250 miles for customers.
Passengers can also reserve seats only when buying directly on Frontier's website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its seat in Denver, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
The revenues decreased by 9 percent and the flight capacity decreased by just under 13 percent in the first quarter, as in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent group, Republic Airways Holdings Inc...
Republic has tried to control Frontier's finances as part of the sale of society.
Proverbs come from the Bible
About 40 women visited the last women's breakfast this year in the Evangelical Church of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the church was "Proverbs from the Bible" and "Expressions from the Middle Ages."
Zita Köhler, the chairman of the church council, responded to the biblical proverbs after breakfast.
"Proverbs contain ways of life, regulations or warnings," she said.
It compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible sites and explained the meaning.
She called proverbs like: "Holzauge be vigilant, as sheaths fall from the eyes, throw an eye on someone, the Lord is in his sleep, wash his hands in innocence."
On several occasions, the speaker also advised her listeners about what the proverb was.
The speech from the Middle Ages was taken up by the church congregate Christel Dehner: All good things are three, making blue, doing something wrong.
She explained the importance and origin of the speeches she called "bridges to the past."
Finally, a Tombola was released.
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously rewritten before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round, the mayor's candidate Roman Waizenegger also mixed.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for unskilled tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry is now being launched at the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Seenplatte.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men who already work as unskilled workers in the industry are to be qualified as experts for hotels and restaurants over three winter.
"The new thing is that the six-month courses end with qualifications," said Carmen Wiechert of the work agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits are diverse: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would receive trained professionals, who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the Agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also includes the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA states that an "internal error" and not hackers are the fault of the crash of the website
The shady National Security Agency stated on late Friday that a mistake had been made to its public website for a few hours and not hackers, as was claimed online.
"NSA.gov was not available for a few hours tonight, as an internal error occurred during a planned update," the espionage agency explained in an e-mail message.
The problem will be resolved that evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS) was not true.
In the early hours of the evening, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours and that this is still not for some users.
Before that, a NSA spokesperson to ABC News had stated that the sensitive internal network of the Authority was "in no way" compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, says the speaker.
At least a group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
Cybertactic is relatively simple and the attacks are not used to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The previously super-secret NSA, whose nickname was No Search Agency (no such authority), is now in the light of the public and is looking at the revelations that have become known over the last few months about its extensive monitoring programme in the home and abroad, which are a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy about the secret service fired initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The number of people without a job fell slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the rate was 3.1% better than the previous year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, Deputy Head of the Employment Agency in Sonthofen.
Many companies have so far reacted to attitudes.
One reason for this is according to Felder-Bauer: "We have hardly any skilled staff in the craft, health and care of the elderly."
Since September, the number of staff in the hotel and restaurant industry has been increasing again.
The winter season begins there in mid-December.
The whole background report can be found in the Allgäuer Anzobblatt of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Profit loss in bombardier after decrease in delivery numbers and orders
The Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15% decrease in net profit on Thursday, following a fall in orders and deliveries to aircraft in the third quarter as well as contract problems in the railway sector.
Bombardier based in Montreal also did not publish any flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information as to whether the aircraft could go into commercial use in accordance with the ambitious schedule next September.
On the young flight of the test aircraft one and a half months ago, only three more starts were followed, which makes it seem questionable whether the test phase is going as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a course crash of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, reduced his assessment on Thursday from "outperformance" to "sector performance" with a view to the fact that the share has a limited course potential in the next one to two quarters.
"Although weaker delivery figures for aircraft were expected to be as far as possible, we are clearly disappointed by the development of margins in the transport sector," said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test program for the aircraft is on the move.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But so far, binding orders for the CSeries are 177 moderate, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see if the company's claims on fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new jet aircraft are applicable.
At present there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
Chairman Pierre Beaudo is confident that Bombardier will reach his target of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet.
On Thursday, the management also assured analysts and media that the program was in the schedule.
"The test aircraft has not remained on the ground longer than expected," said Beaudo at a telephone conference and added that during the aircraft's lifetime ground tests and software updates have been used.
Every manufacturer is planning to do something different.
We have decided to make a first flight and then to set up a review period, whatever we have done.
This is done throughout the flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks, the rest shortly after, it was said from the company side.
However, analysts remain sceptical as to whether the first customer can operate a CSeries aircraft 12 months after the young flight.
Bombardier said it was checking the planning for the start-up (EIS) and will update it in the next few months.
"The slow progress of the flight test - even if apparently they are in line with bombardier's internal planning - strengthens our view that the start-up is moving to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter at the end of September 30, Bombardiers' net profit fell to 147 million dollars and 8 cents per share respectively of 172 million dollars and 9 cents per share in the previous year.
The adjusted profit per share is unchanged at 9 cents.
The sales dropped slightly and fell from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion dollars, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer states that he has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decrease of 57 last year.
The net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The number of orders in the aerospace sector was $32.9 billion on 30 September and was thus unchanged from 31 December.
"In the field of aerospace, the results were within the framework of our specifications, but the low order intake and market conditions as a whole were disappointing," said Beaudo.
The sales in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this sector have increased by just under 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The number of orders in the transport sector was 32.6 billion dollars on 30 September, slightly increased from 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport sector has been affected by resolution problems in some major contracts.
According to management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, the Bombardier share dropped by 8.5 percent and was 4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was also announced that the Google financial director Patrick Pichette will change to the board of directors.
The Brazilian Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10% decrease in the quarter's profit on Thursday.
USA: Shots at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown man fired shots at the LAX airport on Friday morning (local time).
While the airport management told Twitter about the short-term news service that the shooter was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported that the man was dead.
A security man was also killed.
The media also reported several injuries.
US President Barack Obama was constantly informed about the situation, said the White House spokesman, Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses indicated that they saw a shooter with a gun in one of the flight halls, as several media reported.
A traveler told CNN that many people were looking for protection in panic.
Travelers would have screamed and children would have cried.
Among the waiting people, panic had broken out, many would have been hidden behind chairs for fear.
He heard two shots, says a traveler from the Los Angeles Times.
A staff member of the TSA Security Authority suffered a gunshot injury at the foot.
The scene was "like in a movie."
After that he had been brought to a security area himself, the man reported.
The shots are supposed to have fallen close to a security control area.
Airport building evacuated
On television images, it was seen how many medical and police cars were in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were brought out of the building to safety.
Users on Twitter published photos of a special deployment command and a gun on the ground.
As the airport management reported via Twitter, the incident started at 9.30 in the morning (local time).
The access roads were closed, which, according to CNN, formed a long back stop.
Except for landings, air traffic had been temporarily discontinued, it was said.
However, there were also several planes on CNN at the start.
Terminal 3 is mainly operated by smaller US airlines.
The Los Angeles LAX Airport is the largest airport in the United States.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned drug bosses about police investigation must go to prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, passed information on to underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron about a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction could be revealed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about his activities in drug trafficking after he had been compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The "first-class" lawyer, who was praised by criminalists with the nickname "Bash," was arrested in his house in 2011 after the police had monitored Scarborough, which he had represented in an earlier drug trial.
Officials observed how Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, while it was with colleagues at a dinner of the bar.
The investigation showed that Ditta regularly used Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.
For an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain unallowed information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police in a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were arrested later, after the police secured heroin and cocaine in a number of house searches worth 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds of cash.
Ditta, 42, passed on information to the criminals because he feared that his drug dependence could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two charges for obstruction of justice.
He admitted to the cocaine possession in an earlier interview.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigation against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Dita's house and put the drugs there with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the lawyer's trash.
Shortly after he delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly called Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, got the drugs, and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In court it was known that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests of Class A drugs were discovered in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later, but refused to take cocaine and said that he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, and claimed that her discussion was subject to "law enforcement."
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken from him.
In the police interview, he stated that he was operating an office under his private address as well as at work and that clients would call him at home for legal matters.
It was announced in the court that he had called important drug trafficking actors, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed them of what the investigators knew about them.
Attorney Anne Whyte said, "A criminal attorney should know better than anyone that you don't break the law."
Ditta is charged with the abuse of his position as a criminal defender, as he has been too involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not just that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer who provides his lawyer with drugs.
A part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer of these people.
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He opposed the police investigation as much as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta has therefore put his professional status into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta rejected any misconduct and said, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but do it immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the police in Lancashire said: "Mr. Ditta has taken the step from a criminal defender to a criminal in the moment he started to acquire drugs from organized criminals."
His cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organised crime, who instructed him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and confidence.
Ditta has betrayed this trust and is trying to enclose himself behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for the possession of cocaine and judicial disability, which underscores our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and show that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he declared guilty of the conspiracy to trade in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five more people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to total penalties of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself, in which he stated that his dream job was to represent as a lawyer clients in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and opportunity inequality was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160-year-old existence, the Dunningen Liederkranz is surrounded by two divine services with the "Deutsche Messe" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the music "Rock my Life," which inspired the audience in the spring of this year, the band will enrich two divine services at the end of the anniversary year with the performance of the German fair by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary fair will be available at the St. John Baptist Church in Lackendorf during the evening fair in St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27, from 10.15.
The so-called German Mass with the original title "Songs for the Celebration of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass," D 872, is a spiritual work by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of the creation.
The fair is listed in the framework of the services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had it in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the music group Frohnenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ.
Haslach: Skepticism soft-sighted confidence
The 2015 elections to the parish council will, for example, change basic legends in the Hashlach (SE) pastoral care unit.
There is then only one joint parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the bodies from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
Because the basic decisions of the diocese are no longer to be changed and it is up to the parish communities to implement it as satisfactorily as possible.
In the course of the day, it became particularly clear: the scepticism towards the new is hesitant but in the long run a confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the pastoral team reached.
On the basis of a presentation, the Regional Decan Georg Schmitt explained the new guidelines for pastoral units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
In future, the SE Haslach as a church community will form a body of public law that enters into the rights and obligations of the six individual church communities so far.
There will only be a joint parish council and a foundation council in which the parish power office is represented.
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish, and in the six parishes so-called community deams are to be formed on the ground.
Your task will be to promote church life in the place in the future.
The question of the finances of the individual parish then showed a considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide that accumulated assets are to be preserved in the parishes for purpose.
On the other hand, the liabilities are transferred to the entire municipality.
There were great concerns about the large planned investments, the commitment of which was then made by all the parishes.
"In the past, only projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone were invested," said Haslach's parish president Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes was presented by Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the body in the Schutterwald-Neuried pastoral care unit.
They had made their task in 2006, "Become one, stay five," and had to see that this is not so easy.
The bodies of the Hashlach Seelsorgeunit then went on to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council and the practical work of the community deams.
The work will be carried out at further meetings and will be decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.
In the end, the parish council Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral care unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the electricity becomes more expensive
The citizens of Ppullendorf have to adapt to higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of the Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to the SÜDKURIER, a four-head Pfullendorfer family will be charged 70 to 90 euros a year.
The main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEC levy from 5,277 to 6,3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This levy is refixed each year in October by the four operators of the large power lines.
These figures indicate the additional costs they incur from the energy transition, which they can raise through a levy above the electricity price.
The Pfullendorf city works are the last link in this chain.
In its forecasts, the Supervisory Board of the Energy Company even assumed a higher levy, as reported by Jörg-Arne Bias.
Now the concrete figures need to be calculated before the city works can inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We assume an increase of 1 cent plus x," says Bias, where the number will be more close to the 2 cent.
Lamp on permanent red: Watch the waiting time
Sometimes a light just doesn't get green.
The contact loop in the road is not responding, or the light sign is defective.
What should you do then - drive with red?
If a person concerned has waited long enough at a red light and the crossing is free, he can continue, the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker explains in the magazine "Motorcycle."
However, the waiting period should be "appropriate," which could be interpreted differently from one case to another.
Becker advises to wait for at least five minutes before the traffic light is to be assumed to have a malfunction.
However, if you continue to drive in spite of the red light, you must be aware that you are fully responsible for an accident caused by this.
If you are patient for less than five minutes, you may not wait long enough, will Becker warn and refer to a decision of the Oberlandesgericht Hamm.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the light after about three minutes of permanent red and had to be responsible for a negligent red light failure.
The light was not defective, but it was only a little later that it turned to green.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but not the fine.
City Council is pleased about sound budget
Every time it comes to the budget in municipal council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The municipality sackl in Herschwanggen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has not known any debts since 2005.
The financial year 2012 can also be booked as a full success in this sense.
This was made clear in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget was more than one million euros higher than planned, with around 7.6 million euros.
The surplus of the administrative budget was also about EUR 1.8 million above the approach.
The surplus was mainly due to higher commercial tax revenues and the municipal share of income tax.
The budget for assets was also well above the planned values.
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million planned, it was EUR 2.5 million last year.
"This is mainly due to the higher contribution from the administrative budget," Rothmund said.
As less investments have been made than planned in the financial year 2012, the provision of reserves has also been higher.
Overall, the general reserve was increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"You don't just shake such a work out of your sleeve," said Gerster with a view to the annual accounts.
He and the local councils were obviously happy about the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good figures that could soon cost citizens.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality has been able to renounce high rates of lifting in the past.
This in turn, however, according to Gerster, has often been reduced by the country.
There are conditions for these subsidies from various compensatory measures.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities applying for grants must have certain rates of lifting.
"We have to look at the issue of lifting rates, because in the coming years we have to invest, for which we would like to have subsidies," Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermätter for 60 years in the choir
At the age of 60, Hubert Wermter's history is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival, in which he was solemnly honored.
Hubert Wermätter was on stage as usual in the colors of his men's singer.
Even after 60 years, singing with the now probably more than sweet choir still makes him very much fun.
The association was also active, including 28 years as a member of the Committee.
He received several awards for his commitment and his union: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral Reference on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him - as the choir is also a church choir - a document of the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His singer colleagues presented him with the document of the German choir association as well as a engraved tin plate.
In addition to the honor, the 31st autumn festival was in the usual course: with the MGV Betra, the song kranz Salzstetten, the singer's department Baisingen and the local music club, the full marines had loaded a colorful mix of different choirs and singing styles, which had the around 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with vocal songs such as "In the wine paradise" and "Funny, you brothers."
They prepared a small stand for their honor singer Hubert Wermätze - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundessong."
The men's singing club Betra also sang classical chorlies such as "Jägerverben" by Julius Wengert, "Far, far away" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "When you go through the valley."
The song-wreath Salzstetten, with his mixed choir and his group of women - the "Impulschor" - provided the women's rate of the festival.
The mixed choir took "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" from Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "Impulsor" also used foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singer's department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back to home files with "Wat isch der Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Biersong," where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the winning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small program - "Granny Hanne" a.k.a. Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a casserole theatre and read a few stories that the children worked well at noon.
Children's dreams come true
The kindergartens and day care centres in the customs department get mail these days.
The Black Forest messenger, in cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, wants to support the institutions in the realization of their building and beauty wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, day-care centres and children's crèches from the entire customs district can participate in the action.
If you have a construction or beauty request for your establishment, you can apply with this at the Black Forest messenger.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action kindergarten construction site.
A jury, composed of representatives of Black Forest Boats, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, chooses three wishes from all the entries.
What are the conditions for participation?
The wish should be realized with building material of a maximum of 2000 Euro and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself must provide many diligent builders.
What about the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the savings bank Zollernalb.
It is delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and is then to be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and, of course, the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press outrages about controversial media law
"We are in a frightening situation and one can ask ourselves: what is the European Parliament doing about simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?" was read in the newspaper, which does not think the draft law is constitutional.
"The law is draconian and very criminal and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of the Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of the most prestigious independent radio stations and news websites in Kenya.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be preoccupied, because it is an extended arm of the government," and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President listens to us and we call on him to reject this draft law and send it back to Parliament," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government, through the new law, "take the media effectively into a sword." On the other hand, The Standard, Democracy and Freedom of Speech in Kenya wrote "a heavy blow" and called the draft "draconian."
The adoption of the law is one of a number of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the aftermath of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre in September.
The Kenyan media took on the anger of the authorities because they published recordings of security cameras on which it was seen that the units sent to the crime scene allegedly robbed the luxury shopping centre.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded to this by ordering two journalists and a leading media representative, even though the summons were withdrawn after a call from the media.
Under the new law, media houses can be punished for up to 20 million Kenyan schillingen and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, "a single sentence can already push most radio stations into bankruptcy."
In addition, the newspaper considers that these measures could have a devastating effect on the "lively blogosphere" of Kenya according to their description.
If they silence the media, politicians could do whatever they want to do without punishment.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist in the nation, who calls the Kenyan media a crucial control factor in public life.
"If politicians are to be left to themselves, they will lead the country to bankruptcy and back us to the time of the hunters and collectors," he commented.
The Kenyan legislators have already raised public problems in the past.
In May, they agreed to reverse the reductions ordered by the National Compensation Commission and reintroduced their solid salaries of about 532,000 shillings tax-free per month - they are among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream will come true for the FC
The official inauguration ceremony for the Kunstrasensportplatz in spite of the cold weather and the rain did not fall short of the importance for the city and the football club.
A more pleasant time to celebrate the last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play in this.
So all those who came without an umbrella or could not hold one for any reason.
This was done to the musicians who framed the festival, as did some of the speakers.
Nass was therefore also the chairman of the FC Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks were to Mayor Walter Klump, who had been very committed to the implementation of the project, the local council, the companies involved and the members of the association who were involved.
Here especially Lothar Hero, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The older pensioners laid 400 square meters of paving stones for the new ways.
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also appreciated by the Councillor Karl Rombach.
The city sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Badic Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr of the planning office announced a donation for the youth division of the club.
Mayor Klump reminded us that weather-related influences in spring and autumn caused him to become the original lawn square so that he could not be played.
15 years ago, there were the first thoughts to solve the problem when the construction of a third place was planned at the football club site or at the real school on Lake Salinensee.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts came up for the construction of an artificial grass sports site, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were taken up two years ago when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erzlecht, promised a cost contribution of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the site and approved the country's funding of EUR 104 000.
The municipal council decided in October 2012 to take over the remaining EUR 356 000 in the total cost of EUR 560 000, together with Klump.
The construction of the 68 x 108 m artificial grass square was started on June 4.
During the three-month construction phase, 3000 cubic meters of earth were removed, half of which were used for the construction of a dirt-bike line.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on the issues of home affairs and justice.
The relevant working group met in Berlin in the morning.
These include direct democracy, the transfer of Members and the federal police.
The working group on migration and integration also wanted to continue its work in the morning.
This should include, among other things, the issue of double citizenship, where both sides have conflicting ideas.
The SPD wants to end the obligation for migrant children born in Germany to choose one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the issue of transport, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD confirmed its no to a car toll required by CSU.
A Vignette was a "flat rate for many driving and thus environmentally counterproductive," said the SPD negotiator for transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There was a risk of a shift on land roads, which are already a major accident.
In addition, the introduction of a toll for all cars would be a first step from the point of view of Pronold.
"There is a risk that the compensation for Germans will be deleted at a later date," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing hair wave on the open light stage
Stuttgart - "When is it going to be a good summer again?" was actually not the question on Friday night on the open-air stage Killesberg.
It was a tropical night in Stuttgart.
The best conditions for the band, therefore, for the "Schlagerstar" Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.
Click through the picture gallery to see the "singing hair wave."
Car drivers seriously injured in the event of an accident
In an accident on Thursday night, a 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was on the way to Grefrath with her car at 9: 15.
When she wanted to turn left on St. Töniser's road, she oversaw the approaching car of the 37-year-old.
The driver's eye collided.
The Aachener suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Constance: lock after accident at the Schänzlekressel
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza on Thursday night, around 8: 00 on the left lane of the two-lane Reichenaustraße drove thousands of cities.
Shortly before the roundabout at the Schänzle, he noticed that he was on the left-hand side of the road towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and changed to the right-hand lane.
This led to a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old constanzer.
The VW Passat of a 19-year-old was also damaged behind the BMW.
A total of about 15000 material damage occurred, the police reported.
The track had to be closed during the accident, it was said.
Vienna Airport Determines Passenger Calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
This will no longer be the case at Vienna-Schwechat Airport.
A large part of the speakers' announcements are therefore missing - the noise level is to be significantly reduced.
To create a more relaxed atmosphere is the aim of this innovation.
As the airport spokesman Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna, the Vienna Airport is following an international trend with the setting-up of individual-person announcements.
For example, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai already do not have the noisy calls.
By the removal of these announcements - on average, about 200 personal calls from the speakers on one day - it will be more quiet at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual announcements were relatively little perceived, but at the same time all the other information about modified flight steps or departure times are going down here a little bit," said Kleemann in conversation with the radio station.
Highlander Games at the Kaltenhof
There is a second competition at the farm autumn festival at the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7, the Highlander Games will start at 1.30 pm.
They have a Scottish tradition, but they are swamped on the cold yard.
Teams and individual fighters measure themselves in the disciplines tree-baskets, horseshoe-throwing and water-bucket-carrying.
The tree stem is four and a half meters long and 25 to 30 kilograms heavy.
"It does not depend on the width," explains organizer Peter Saile.
The tribe must be discarded vertically, should once overlay and then come to the lie.
This is assessed with most points.
When throwing a horseshoe, it depends on the accuracy of the target.
From eight meters away, a stake is thrown.
Skill and strength must be demonstrated by the participants in the water bucket carrying over 50 meters.
Time and water in a botch are measured at the end.
From each "clan" or team, two are allowed to participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition will receive prizes.
It can be trained from 10: 00.
A suitable clothing is required, for example the competitors can take up in the gravel rock.
But also Swabian power is allowed.
For the "outfit" the jury gives a few bonus points.
You can register until one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highlander Games and the tractor pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, there is already a lot of action on the festival site on Saturday.
In the evening, the bubble music friends will be at their expense.
At 7: 00 pm, the Byrabehömische Blas music from Schömberg forms the great evening of entertainment.
The chapel plays flat polkas and fairy tales.
But their repertoire also includes sensitive waltz and a saddled big-band sound.
With this will be the known as the singing host and black sausage baron Heinz Koch from Weilen among the Rins.
In Dornhan he has already performed at the Christmas market and the fool tongue.
On Sunday, the music club has Leinstetten for early jumping, from 2: 00 am the Böffingen farm chapel is a guest, and the "Oldies" then make the festival sound out.
The stop-up party with DJ Ralf has already started on Friday.
Other programme points are on Saturday and Sunday, among other things, the Oldtimer and Trapper Meeting, exhibitions by companies on agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the Maislabyrinth, the Crafts Market and the Sheep Sheep.
For children there is a string zoo, Strohhüpfburg, tractor drive (under instructions) and tractor surfing.
The event is organized by the multi-purpose-hall, the ski club and the tractor-friends "Zündkäpsele."
Overview of milk and egg alternatives
Vegan nutrition requires plant alternatives to eggs, milk and milk products.
Pürierte tofu with plant seed is, for example, a quarkerset.
The Federation of Vegetarians calls it World Vegan Day on November 1.
The Vegetarian Federation of Germany proposes a number of vegan alternatives on the occasion of the World Vegan Day on 1 November:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, yogurt is replaced by soya yogurt.
Instead of milk, soya, oats, almond or rice milk can be used.
Tackable plant seed substitutes for conventional whipped cream.
There are also vegetable alternatives to eggs.
Half a crushed, ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple or a spoon of ground linseed plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this.
The dough is loose instead of egg, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of food starch and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of soy yogurt or silk tofu can fulfil this purpose.
According to the Vebu, some 800 000 people are currently feeding vegan in Germany, that is, pure plant.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest High School met the American major city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, it went straight to the Brooklyn Bridge, through which the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached on foot.
Here there was already a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which is a special attraction in the evening light.
Through the time shift, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but according to the motto "The City does not sleep" the day at Times Square was decided.
Despite shutdown, the Statue of Liberty could be reached on the second day with a ferry and climbed on foot.
Then we went through the financial center around Wall Street to the memorial of the 11th of September.
On the third day, the students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating large city from the 373-metre-high viewing platform of the Empire State building, while enjoying the view.
After that, it went through the hectic drive of the New York streets over the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity for short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience the day of school at Weymouth High School.
This year again a Hubertusse is celebrated on the name day of Saint Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien on the Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was a very reckless hunter who was later appointed Bishop of Liège by a vision.
The hunting-horn group of the hunting-leaders of Westfalen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth music on parforcehörner (natural horns in the mood It) after old, originally French melodies.
The blower wear riding clothes because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dog men on towing yachts.
The fair will take place on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30.
The newly designed lift shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and come back.
One that wants to make the name of the program.
According to Lexikon, the term Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that is expressed in the feeling that it has already experienced or seen a new situation.
In the case of the visit of the café of the same name at the top of the district of Kleve in view of the University of Rhein-Waal it does not have to stay with the pure déjà Vu feeling.
Finally, the café with its beautiful name has exactly this goal: to make a real stay not only thoughtful, but always easy to experience again and again.
Because it's fun and it's just beautiful.
A look into the inner life at the top 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at the moment.
The modern but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel well.
Here the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top pamper the guest with various coffee or cocktail variants.
There are delicious cakes or individually-made fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, already made a name for themselves before the opening of the delicious café at the top as a restaurant: in Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge."
From the move to Kleve at the top, the friendly café-lovers hope for more audience.
Not least through the university.
"We have no specific target group," says Daniel Büttner.
In fact, the two young students here want to address the same thing as seniors and all age groups in between.
Speaking of café lovers.
The friendly owner couple is behind the coffee.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in the most varied variations.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is rather the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the Cappuccino drinker.
"A baguette - this is my thing," the NRZ tells them.
There were two events in the bright café.
Better to say one.
Because the harbour festival was rather outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the Ringelnatz evening.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's business.
Maybe that's why Daniel Büttner is not a great fan of event evenings: "You can't make it all right."
And with an event I always address only those who are interested in the special event.
That's why events will be the exception with us.
"We want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible."
This means that Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
With regard to the quality of the products offered here, as well as to the team and the beautiful environment at the stop in Kleve.
The road, which is becoming more and more a restaurant mile.
For the joy of many glue, the guests from close and far away and the students who discover the restaurant mile and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of thanks at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165. Foundation Festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
At the "Witteborg" restaurant in Dinker, everyone enjoyed harmonious cooperation in the sign of music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is always the right strength to perform honours.
The special award "Singer of the Year" was this time the writer Rolf Wagener.
"You have not only written a lot for us, but have also made some rounds for us, for which our warm thanks," said the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for the participation in the performances and choral samples by means of activities were awarded this year to the choir leader Dieter Schulze with 44 participants, followed by the Honorary Chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and the last year's "singer of the year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participants each.

The board of directors was particularly grateful to the team of the club owner Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again had a menu of the extra class and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" always meets for his regular choir rehearsals at 7: 45 on Tuesdays at the club's place.
"New happy voices are welcome to us at any time," says Schlotmann.
UN announces new targets in the fight against poverty
The United Nations is now starting to develop a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals for poverty reduction announced 12 years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which started in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in the launch of "sustainable development goals" to replace the Millennium Goals to be launched in 2015.
They were included in the final draft document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the evening at the summit that the time had come to "think about national interests."
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to start a process with which universal, sustainable development objectives are to be agreed," he said.
"These objectives will be based on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 Development Framework.
I will not be afraid to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to achieve our vision of the sustainable development objectives that are based on the success of the Millennium Goals. "
Even though the SG Achim / Baden has been without victory for four days, there is still a good mood for the Handball-Oberligist.
This leaves no doubt to Trainer Tomasz Malmon.
Everyone is still fully motivated in the matter.
However, I hope that we will finally win again.
"For I don't even know what a victory is like," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at the VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third-party reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet ripped out trees, Malmon is in advance warming the index finger.
I have trained a lot of players myself in the A-Youth.
From that point of view, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"It is also important to see if there is any backup from the first," explains the SG coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to the previous performances.
It was, in the last few months, a great deal of work on the cover and the switch-over.
The exploitation of opportunities must also definitely be improved.
So I hope that my players finally got their heads free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of conflicts between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the State and first President of Mozambique, to vote for peace calls at a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of an investment company.
For fear of the future of the country, she has exchanged her business clothes for a T-shirt with the title "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined on Thursday the crowd at the capital's independence place.
For two weeks now, almost every day, there have been reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once an infamous rebel movement, which was initially supported by the white-ruled Rhodesia and later by the South African apartheid government in an attempt to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 peace treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts think it is unlikely that the country will fall back into a growing conflict, but recent events have upset foreign investors and local people.
The fast-growing economy is at stake, because the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal in the north-west could bring investment of over 50 billion US dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States into the country in the next few years.
The ruling Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional city of Renamos, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, explained Renamo's spokesman to the Financial Times.
The government is blaming Renamo for the clashes and accusing the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to address concerns about instability.
On Wednesday, he said to AFP, the French news agency, that Dhlakama considered himself a "loser," who "wants to use all of his remaining forces to prove that he can force the government to make its decisions."
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words that Renamo gave up the 1992 peace agreement.
He explained to the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our vision is to start negotiations again, seriously," said Mazanga.
Previous discussions between the parties have contributed little to the resolution of the tensions that have been fired by a number of clashes this year.
"We have two grown men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama), who come together," says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is good at negotiating, and none is ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pressing for election reforms, has already stated that she will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo's election has been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza - whose resignation is due when his second term of office ends next year - wanted to destroy the country's democracy.
"He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidential office," says Mazanga.
It is not clear what capacity Renamo has, but it has made disturbing attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south connection.
Most of the battles took place in the province of Sofala, which is located a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but in which Beira is located, the port, the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale used to export coal.
In June Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the line.
Mazanga answered with caution whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted "to warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique," said Mazanga.
Instability has increased the frustration about the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people were already concerned about corruption, slow progress in development and a recent wave of kidnapping.
"People think that the government and the President are responsible for the country's future and should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultan, a protester, said people just wanted stability.
"None of them are interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads again," he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "examples of life," an author says.
Thor's stories showed that "brutal power has no chance against smart tricks," and the artus legend shows how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the myths were "far too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools," which is why Crossley-Holland called for a "careful selection" of old-age works.
"I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for 20 years.
He added that in the case of authors and teachers who were "excessive didactic," children would "completely shut down" because in entertaining stories the messages would be "submissive."
Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, said: "You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as possible."
Perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or to lead to the happy end, but there is an immense sense of good and evil.
This must be submissive, through which history is revealed and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob is moving again in the courtyard
A hundred years ago, Heinrich Hansjakub moved to his retirement home in Haslach, and on Sunday his last years were living in the "Freihof."
The many spectators were thrilled by the extremely short-time scene game.
From the arrival through the award of honorary citizenship to his death, screenwriter and Hansjakobactor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece, which received much applause under the direction of Cornelia people.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained relationships and bridged times from youth to the near retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob comes home in his children's sky, in his courtyard.
And then the scene game began, in which Alois Krafczyk once again gloss in his paraderlole as a great son of the city.
He was a member of the "Schwarzwälder Fuchsen" ("Schwarzwälder Fuchsen") of Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was not only received by the audience with much applause, but his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to get involved in the role of the sister and gave her up in mixes and gestures of immense life.
Between the individual games scenes, the Mühlenbach peasant chapel played well-selected pieces of music and finished the performance.
In order to give the honorary citizenship, Hashach's mayor Heinz Winkler gave himself the honor to be the one who, in the presence of the then-mayor, had made his stay together with a part of the city council.
The three-king singers, who led Hanjakob to the exclamation, then made their wake up: "Oh, how beautiful, that's when the youth's memories of my own three-king period will come to life again."
With their song "O Jesulein," they enjoyed the audience in the courtyard as well as the stork day children with their loud "out, out."
At that time, his criticism of the church had been expressed by Hansjakob as well as his concerns about the evolutions in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of the war.
In the home earth, behind his grave chapel on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A troubled spirit had finally found its peace and had gone home forever," it was said at the end of the scene game.
There were many applause and many commenting words from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar giant grows
The chances of the remaining league of the sports-winning Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball players have increased.
For if there is a wild card procedure, then for the Neckar giants there is now one competitor less.
The Hamburg Towers basketball project does not have an application for a possible retreat.
"We will not participate in the Wildcard process," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been working on the concept of a Proficclub in the Hanseatic City since 2012.
A first breath was still not to be heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the Wildcard procedure, so long as it is not established that Düsseldorf does not receive a license," said Neckar-giant-boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
By 23 May, ascender Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the Arbitration Court and prove its economic viability.
So far, however, the licence has been refused twice to the Rhine countries.
The Arbitration Court is the last instance.
Haigerloch: The evening church is in the spotlight
As the contribution of the city to the 150-year-old presence of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the cultural and tourism office of the city is dedicated to the last of its public themes this year on Sunday, October 27, the evening church.
After the visit of the nuclear-cellar museum, the Haigerlocher time after 1850 is to be considered when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The closing point is a visit to the evening church.
There the leaders are told the story of the building of the church and gain insight into the development of the Protestant community in a Catholic area.
Last but not least, the church also has a look at the evening painting created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original reproduction of the famous Milan model of Leonardo da Vinci.
Meeting point for the other half-hour tour is at the nuclear cellar museum at 3: 00.
There are maps at the checkout of the nuclear-cellar museum.
For questions and information, the Tourist Office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also testify in Russia
The former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the US spawning affair.
Representatives of the Federal Prosecutor General could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in Russia personally.
This has been reported to the Interfax Agency by reference to unnamed circles who are familiar with the situation.
It was said that such a question could be clarified by the intergovernmental authorities.
An exit of Snowdens from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the Agency quoted its source.
Because Germany is an ally of the United States, Snowden threatened to deliver it there, it said more
Long breath is getting paid
Six men's teams fought for the winner in the tennis tournament.
In the end, the endurance of the Maier / Bronner team decided the last match.
A dream weather had received the tennis department of the Sportfreunde Rohrdorf for the tournament of local clubs and friends.
The fun at the tennis game was at the forefront of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the plan, each playing against everyone.
It was played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes duration.
Anja Schöchter runs the tournament
The tournament line was in the best hands of Anja Schliechter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favorites Andre Maier / Matthias Bronner were equal to Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of SG Rohrweiler), so the last two matches had to make the decision.
At the time of the victory, Carmen Müller was finally able to hand over the hiking trophy to Andre Maier / Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the target line.
The second place was the double Michael Klippel / Sadmin Osmicic.
The bronze strip reached Rainer and Bernd Maier of the team Asphaltriecher.
At late afternoon sun and coffee and cake the successful sound of the tournament took place.
At the last weekend of August, the Black Forest Museum of Freellicht Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is again firmly in the hands of children.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes the visitors on Saturday and Sunday, August 24 and 25, to a colourful children's and family's festival with numerous co-actions and events in the context of the summer holiday programme.
"Big and small can learn different old crafts on both days," says the press release.
Whether soap is made, candles are turned, felt, or ropes are made, for every age the right thing is there.
The children are assisted by regional craftsmen from 11 am to 5 pm.
The museum workshop also works.
The young guests can demonstrate their craft skills in the construction of cuckoo, water-cycle or circle.
The many old games, such as wheelbarrow racing or stalking, also promise a lot of fun.
Speed and coordination are required here.
For all small detectives, the open-air museum offers a mystery tour of the museum on Saturday and Sunday, at 12: 00 and 2: 00.
In a process of change, the children must guess which stories correspond to the truth or are still lying.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with Black Forest Fuchsen.
Not only horses, but also many other animals, such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens, are to be found and amused on the site.
In addition, all children can look forward to the Clown Otsch on Sunday, which will be in charge of the guests of the museum from 11 am.
In the meantime, it is nice and fairytale to meet Hermann Büttner.
The storyteller takes the little guests to the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11: 00, 13: 00 and 15: 00.
In addition, the Gutach Children's Trachtdance Group presents traditional dances at 11.30.
In addition, a large number of craftsmen, such as the broom binder, the seaman, the spinner, the weberin and the baker, can be seen over the shoulder in their traditional work on both events from 11 to 17 hours.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum expect a varied holiday program.
In a small town in New Zealand, Burt Muro is considered to be a lovable cheese because he has planned to take part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Burt is not to be removed from his dream despite a heart failure.
With his savings, a few donations and a mortgage on his old workshop shed, he transfers to Los Angeles by ship.
After the film there are coffee, tea and cake.
Schrill's beeping interferes residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal from the ships to the halves.
The company has several iron in the fire at the site.
In addition to the coal import, Rhenus Midgard relies on, among other things, wind plant logistics.
Black shines the coal on the warehouse in front of the dike.
Two large blue hand-held and back-loading equipment distribute or load the coal here as necessary.
With each movement of the transducers, a loud warning sound sounds over the site.
"The signals are for security and are required by law," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of the Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, in the event of an unfavourable wind this is far to hear - and so there were already some complaints from people from the city north.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore contacted those concerned, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, it is now possible to keep the warning signals down with technical measures.
He will continue to rely on open dialogue with the neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell has a lot to do at the location.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the major in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18.5 meters deep-down front of the terminal, Capeside-Bulkcarrier can be finished here for a long time.
"This year, we want to crack the 3 million-ton brand in the envelope," says Schrell.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, the import coal goes to power plants in the inland.
If the GDF-Suez power plant is still on the grid, a good 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year are realistic.
The three ships on the bridge as well as the second transport band could create up to 10 million.
Bayern's basketball player despite first defeat optimistic
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not reduce the enormous optimism of the basketball team Bayern Munich.
"No one can forbid us to believe in winning against the best team in Europe in the past two years," said Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic, after the unfortunate 83: 88 (39: 47) on Thursday night at the title defender Olympiakos Piraeus.
We have sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
At their first third appearance in the European royal class, the Münchner sold very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the decisive phases.
The guests first managed to turn a 15-point backlog into a guided tour 13 minutes before Piraeus turned the game again.
"We have unbelievably fought back against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then again made reckless mistakes," said Bayern-Profi Yassin Idbihi.
We're proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful yards of the Münchner, who had celebrated significant victories in the first two games against the Italian serial master Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title carrier Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, the variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, started to tell the crowd of direct jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay's innovation has been expanded, as was the last time at the New York Comedy Festival.
In the life called and led by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up institution of Carolines, the festival this year celebrates its ten-year anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headliners started at Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were ever too well known to play in a club," said Hirsch.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
At this year's event there are performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as "Stand Up for Heroes," an annual music and comedy benefit event for army veterans in Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby are performing.
The festival has also grown the world of comedy.
A number of the Comedians who are participating in the festival this year have become known by rather unconventional means, such as small TV channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a sitcom on cable television (the ironic-slippery fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the occupation for both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation" although she is most well known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."
Both Kroll and Slate and other young Comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, focused on racial issues W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralised world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visitors to the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a television show entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting takes place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me when he's here, he sometimes goes through the alley between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose all my money, I might live here."
Iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran is showing up one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN Vetomächts and Germany is satisfied with the negotiation process.
"After years, we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to clear the differences in recent years," said Foreign Minister Mohammed Dschawad Sarif on his Facebook page.
It would still be a long way to go, but the nuclear dealer was satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that at the end both sides would come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys Kill Games with Machete
Two children have confessed to the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12 year old boys had invited their victims to go on a bird hunt with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, reported the newspaper "El País" on Thursday.
They would have played football in front of their homes in a working-class district.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 km north of the exclusive beach town of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the younger who had taken them with them was to say that she was sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl described the case before the police without mentioning an attack against her, the two boys admitted the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.
The older one called it a rivalry in the football game.
He was temporarily admitted to a psychiatric youth centre.
The pimp must go to prison
The Landgericht Konstanz has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison for the exploitation of human trafficking, pimp, threat, insult and dangerous assault.
The former Federal Army soldier, who worked as a doorman after two operations in Afghanistan, made a confession in the framework of a process discussion.
He therefore met women in five cases via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent to the point after a few weeks against their will.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He retained the income of the women who, in part, bought for him for years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he signed up to women's contacts with the outside world.
Together with a colleague who sent the women, he brought them to various brothels in the southwest.
There he had them partly monitored to control their revenue.
In court, the defendant first claimed that he was suffering from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan were killed in an explosion next to him.
After a psychiatric expert expressed great doubts about the mental limitation and therefore of a limited liability, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court had to hear no more of the women who were damaged.
As a Cripo official reported, after a first notification by telephone surveillance measures, at least four other cases of exploitation of human trafficking could be identified.
The heard talks were marked by high aggression.
In later consultations, the victims would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in which one of the women had discovered blue spots all over the body, has made no statement to this day.
It was "a completely broken personality," which considered violence and exploitation in this metier to be normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He has separated himself from these circles and wanted to live a normal life after the prison," he said.
Oil price continues to give up to $96 per barrel
The oil price continued to fall on Friday, after concerns about a high supply overshadowed a report on the growth of China's energy-hungry manufacturing sector.
The reference raw material for deliveries in December had fallen in the late morning in Europe in electronic commerce at the New York Mercantile Exchange by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price drop of 5.8 percent in October.
The large supply of crude oil has put a burden on prices in recent weeks.
The US Ministry of Energy stated on Wednesday that the US offer had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, the offer had increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday there was evidence of increased demand through two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese production.
This indicates a continued recovery of the economy of China, whose growth had increased to 7.8 percent in the third quarter, after reaching the lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades.
Crude oil from the Brent variety, a reference value for international crude oil, which is also used by US refineries, fell at the ICE Exchange in London by 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel.
Court blocks decision on the NYPD Stop-and-Frisk Directive
A federal court in the USA blocked on Thursday the order of a judge who had called for changes to the Stop-and-Frisk program ("stop and search") of the New York Police Department, and removed the judge from the case.
The Second US Court of Appeal stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Schendrin were suspended until a decision was taken on the city's appeal.
The judge had ruled in August that the city was in breach of the Constitution with the way in which the programme for the stopping and questioning of persons is implemented.
The city appealed to its assessment and to the appropriate remedies, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending its directive and the appropriate training programme.
The appeal court heard on Tuesday the arguments for the requested suspension.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be dismissed from the case because she had violated the code of conduct for US judges by providing that a judge should avoid the appearance of the party; this was partly based on a number of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the court's criticism.
The judge had ruled that police officers were violating the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, because they were unreasonably targeting black and Latin American men with the Stop-and-Frisk programme.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes, including reforms in directives, training and service supervision, and set up a pilot programme with body-borne cameras in quarters where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of persons who were released after a police check.
An oral hearing on the city's appeal is scheduled after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-Frisk tactics have been criticised by a number of civil rights defenders.
This type of control has been in different forms for decades, but the number of registered controls during the term of office of the partisan mayor Michael Bloomberg has increased to an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men, all of whom were minorities, filed an action which became a collective situation.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD Stop-and-Frisk programme say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trusted and effective police force and influence the way other police leaders use the regime.
Answers believe that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not the crime; also would waste money and not solve the wider problem of a police that is under pressure after the disappearance of thousands of posts in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-Frisk practice, which was constitutional, but only reform the way the NYPD controls are implemented.
The happiness of the dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that can only achieve dreaming camels
The first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the Association "Helping Hands."
On Saturday afternoon the 10th anniversary of the association was celebrated, which can already have considerable success.
The first President Henne reported in detail on the work of the association.
He was the first time in Mauritania in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajed hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, further cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on the ground on several trips.
During the speeches, pictures of the operations on a large screen were shown, so that the guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the actions mentioned above.
The desert vehicle of the club was also shown.
It is a former federal border guard vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed that this vehicle be equipped with a photovoltaic system and now, according to Henne, is planning to work at the association in an advisory capacity.
In 2008, the carpentry Schleeh from Baiersbronn created in the record time of just under a week the Sick Station in Soogim, a poverty district on the outskirts of the capital - volunteer.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic is to be wegratified in Nagold.
They learn a lot in Africa as a doctor, says Henne, for example, detox against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, it was not possible to make as many trips as planned, but many doctors came to Germany to hospit here in different areas.
In addition, containers with material are sent to Africa regularly, such as medical equipment, medicines, bandages, hospital beds and glasses in March of this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided numerous local colorit by telling from Mauritania of Mercedes vehicles converted to the mobile goat stable and describing the experiences of the Stepheimer musicians who traditionally support the association during their Mauritania trip.
As his personal reasons he called his work in the field of audit as a young Member.
When he realized how much money was lost on the way, he decided to help the Africans control a budget by the people.
Fuchtel also stressed that global economy also requires global love for human beings.
Nor should it be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
It was not far from Gran Canaria to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
The former news of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair of the then Minister of the Interior Charles Clarke.
Public Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court in Old Bailey that in May 2005, News of the World had heard a false rumor that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper ordered the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemails and persecute them, but Coulson also called them and left news as the court found out.
"According to the Public Prosecutor, Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, is no one who stands in front of people's homes and hopes to find them on a fresh act, but one who likes to face a story to see their reaction," Edis said.
He said that NotW used three procedures to investigate stories in an investigative way: phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second, the surveillance, otherwise it can't be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He's gonna deny it, but we're gonna say, "And if he knew about it."
Rumor about an affair Clarke was first taken up by the feature editor of NotW when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A band with voice mails from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in Mulcair's apartment in August 2006.
The investigators also found records on the computer of the detective on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects."
In the time when the research went on, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the surveillance of the movements of Pawlby.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voice mail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow, which I would like to talk to Charles about."
Edis said that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities, such as the former Minister of the Interior David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had faced a married woman for an affair when he himself was involved with the co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks argue that they have sworn to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
The French football will actually go through the first strike since 1972 in protest against the planned Reichstax.
A conciliation meeting will end without results.
In the conflict about the rich tax, the government and the professional football in France have maneuvered into a dead end after a failed conciliation meeting.
President François Hollande received representatives of the association and association on Thursday at the Paris Élysée Palace and also listened to their complaints.
However, he refused to spare the football from the planned 75% tax on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country are expected to pay for two years from 2014.
The other side also remained hard.
The strike announced for the end of November will now also be carried out, the head of the Association of Profiklubs (UCCF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, announced.
The days started between November 29 and December 2 in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 are therefore cancelled.
Gedingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants early in the planning process," Mayor Jens Häßler opened the civil information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Some 80 participants had come to the congregations to explain the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns and to bring ideas.
Häßler made it clear that "the final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council."
The flood that hit Gechingen on 15 May 2009, unprepared, had been a significant event that raised the question of protection for the future, said Häßler.
A river area investigation was commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many built-up land as possible is the goal," says Häßler.
The planning of the protection against a high-water, which is expected to be expected every 100 years, is established according to the German weather service.
The climate change is taken into account by a 15% surcharge.
In specialist circles this is called "HQ 100aKlima."
The water masses, which had caused significant damage in Gechingen in 2009, were equivalent to a 1000-year-old flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," says Häßler.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima, it is necessary to invest around EUR 4 million in Gechingen, with the municipality being able to expect regional grants of around 70%.
However, Häßler pointed out that funding only exists if an overall approach is implemented.
To this end, the community was dependent on the participation of the citizens.
An elaborate planning and approval procedure had to be completed.
In the best case, implementation could be started in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was already presented in the municipal council last week (we reported), provides for local measures in the inflow of the river Irm from the Stamheimer Valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, participants took the opportunity to present their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and reservoirs were planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the responsible engineering office Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it needed the interaction of all the measures presented in order to achieve in total the desired goal.
In addition, it was held to find the most economic solution, said Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe.
Unmut was found in the old town's residents, who, even in the case of normal thunderstorms, are constantly suffering from an overload of the canal network.
The problem is known in the administration and first measures have already been taken.
However, Häßler pointed out that the Directives on the Channel Systems were different from those on the protection of the flood and should not be mixed.
The municipality was obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three years of real events could be dealt with.
To increase the size of the waste water channels would devour millions.
Serious injuries after collision
In the early Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured at a frontal collision on the state road 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately closed the road completely, but could not say much about the accident.
However, there are several testimonies that should be evaluated first.
It is clear that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf went towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Getdorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, with the woman so heavily jammed that the fire brigade took about half an hour to get her out of the vehicle wreck.
The actual cause of the accident was first unexplained.
Both the victims came to nearby hospitals.
The route was closed for about two hours.
He could be called the Dostojewski of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a god-seeker, a metaphysist, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Surprisingly the kinship in the outside: the stinging eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fjodor M. Dostojewski, with his massive oeuvre as the founder and apologet of the Russian soul, is to be read as an American prophet, Philip K. Dick, who is quite something in his own country.
Some titles have been published in the Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories is selling two thousand.
Dick explains America - the kingdom of breathtaking technical progress, paired with paranoia, security, and the faith of being chosen.
Dick had God's experiences, his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, had drugs on his brain.
He understood, early on, that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the creator from his creature.
This is the Blade Runner problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "Minority Report" dates back to 1956, it flows the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunale.
The principle of "pre-crime," "pre-crime," which is now more or less the official doctrine of the White House, is being developed here.
In Dick's world, which is the same as ours, mutants look into the future - and the police are on their way.
"We capture individuals who have not violated any law," says the head of the authority.
"We'll catch them before they can commit a violent crime."
And, "There are no serious criminals in our society, for which we have a criminal record full of pesudo criminals." They read time flows.
They assume that bad is happening and prevent the criminal thought from being put into effect.
Dick's story acts like the blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the NSA's radio exchange.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama's drones-philosophy and practice works.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The police chief complains that there is no more division of force, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the guard himself is monitored and transferred to a future crime.
The system is going crazy.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own requirements.
Not only does mistakes and sacrifices take place in purchase, but they build on it.
The system creates the danger it is fighting.
Reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth.
Spawing to testify Merkel in Russia
The former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the US Spawing affair about Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Prosecutor could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in Russia personally, the agency Interfax reported.
Before that, the Green-Bundestag member Hans-Christian Ströbelle had met yesterday as the first German politician Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the affair.
NSA revelations strengthen company paranoia because of government surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's financial capital.
On the instructions of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and the fight against terrorism (BVT), the German Internal Intelligence Service, he should photograph the roof of the US external post, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to demonstrate the presence of monitoring trends and the action led to an exchange of words between the US and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, again in September, insisted that the US did not use foreign espionage to "steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies so that they could increase their international competitiveness or profit."
But since Edward Snowden, the former Whistleblower, has started to publish his fill horn on US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure that they can speak to the Director.
Reports that the American National Security Agency has been spying on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and has acquired data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, have brought the company's paranoia to a new level because of state surveillance.
The barrel overran the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was connected, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then it is certainly possible that corporate management is also a potential target.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," explains Oliver Grün, President of the BITMi, who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US is now at almost the same risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, such a survey published by the EY consultant in July.
However, in the documents leaked by Snowden, there has been no evidence that the US has passed on the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU was lacking certain IT and Internet opportunities and that it should reduce its dependence on the US.
The companies are sceptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was proposed that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly reopen them...
"This is not how it works," says Hasso Plattner, Chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you should not have let them die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except the IT industry.
However, range and technical refinement of the US spy-controlled companies exposed by the Snowden revelations have shocked those who had previously seen the largest spy risk in China.
Cloud computing is a major change because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US are subject to the relevant case law and are therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, some ten percent of the non-US-based members rejected plans to use an American provider after the revelations about the US data mining activities with Prism.
Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director of SAP, says: "We see a new question from customers who did not exist a year ago - it is: Where are my data stored and can you guarantee that these will remain physically in this area of justice?"
Many German corporate leaders believe that the recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore need to be guarded at all costs.
That economic espionage is not a surprise.
That's always been the case.
"It has been a subject for many years and has not changed fundamentally as a result of the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at a commercial and industrial level, as we are doing, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
The management does not usually brag about the counter-measures that have been taken, because that creates advantages for attackers.
In large companies, employees have long been told that taking a free USB stick at a fair or unguarded leaving a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable.
Ulrich Hackenberk, member of the board of directors at Audi, says that it has been part of the standard practice for years to collect the phones before a board meeting so that they can't be used as interrogators.
The German BVT advises managers to use simple prepaid phones when they travel abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones were thrown away after that.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their niche.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorized access," the BVT warns in a report.
The US warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post, in February, in the US National Intelligence Estimate, France, Russia and Israel were ranked behind China as two of the countries that served to obtain economic data from the hacking.
A member of the board of a German blue chip company agreed when it comes to economic espionage, then "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: "The secret services know very well that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terror, spy on their allies."
Hechingen: Fair answers wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important journey of discovery that man can do," said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how at least the wedding party succeeds now gave a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Represented were important providers around a wedding.
A trend: The retro-look has been reinstated.
This starts with the wedding clothes.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
In the front, the many knitted and embroidered clothes are closed, often with a veil, but in the back they go down and often end up in a tug.
However, as Stefanie Koch points out, the spirits separate from the fashion house of Kleidmüller.
In men, the suit dominates with vest and plastic, but it can also be chosen cream-coloured or brown combinations.
The choice of the place was explained.
The rooms are not perfect, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the Remise.
If you want to go ahead with the carriage, you have an offer for Uwe Link.
"Coaching is also popular for young people's parties," he says.
Romantic is also required for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
The "After-Wedding-Photo" comes more and more in fashion - in other words, recording series in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the festival, but in wedding clothes, Elisabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented on Sunday in the domain.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cake and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in a stylish way.
Not to mention the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable party.
Dog friends successful
For the time being, the athletes of the dog-friends Bitz were successful at a rally-service tournament.
Ahim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his dog Sandy he scored 94 points in the class beginners and secured the fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he put it in place at 87 points.
Susi Höpp, with her Woody in Class 1, faced the critical views of the performance judge.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a rolled-up ringer mat in the gymnasium of his high school, are convinced that their son was murdered, said the family's lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found on January 11 in a set-up mat standing behind the gallery in the Schulturnhalle.
The police officers of the Sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the family of the 17-year-old had doubts.
"They are convinced that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, to FoxNews.com.
You never thought he died the way the sheriff did.
"They believe that it has no logic to violate the laws of physics and common sense," said Crump.
Rather, they were convinced that the truth was covered up in order to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school to learn and came back in the body bag," he commented.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday there will be a formal investigation into the death of Johnsons, as a number of important questions are still unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
That's what Moore said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy was that Johnson had died of the consequences of a "position-related suffocation."
A second autopsy, however, was another cause of death, said Moore.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added, if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into the death of Johnsons, he will instruct the FBI to carry out the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff's authority was not immediately ready to comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in the south of Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities release all the surveillance videos that the investigators have checked.
The parents of the teenager said they were hoping that the video records contained evidence of how he died.
CDC publish the Allergy Directives for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies from children to schools.
These are the first such directives issued by the US government, as the number of children in school with food allergies is increasing.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The spread of food allergies among children has increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007, according to CDC.
The guidelines provide information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies in the teaching body and employees and how to deal with children who have allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock - the car injection of the EpiPen brand is most commonly used - to be able to cope with a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
The law-makers in the states have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep Epinephrin in stock more easily.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms called in children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "It feels like something is pressing on my tongue," "My tongue feels like a hair is on it" or "My tongue is crawling."
Parents of intersexual children can choose "sex indefinitely"
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognised for children born with not clear genitals.
Newborns are no longer assigned either male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to explain sex for such children, but can indicate "indefinitely" or "not defined" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make any hasty decisions in relation to operations for a sex allocation in newborn children, and to combat discrimination against intersexual people.
According to BBC years later, an intersexual person said, "I'm not a man or a woman."
I remain the patchwork created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children is not born every year as a boy or a girl.
They are among the intersexual, a group that fall under the diagnosis "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the United States suggest that you use the best available information on gender allocation if a provision is not possible and do not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before you decide, if any, to do an operation.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the issue of gender identification, said that the new German law "sounds like a good thing."
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but most children do not," he said.
One could do a sex assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
The scientific data on how a child develops his gender identity at all are not very accurate.
No one knows why it's happening.
It's like the secret that makes people gay.
A report to the European Commission in 2011 states that intersexual people are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender persons, because their status is not gender-related, but because of their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These properties were shown in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hardening, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination that intersexual and transgender persons are exposed to in their working life, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Non-gender-related boys now have a special camp.
In the meantime, in Australia and Nepal, it is possible for adults to indicate on official documents male, female or "third sex."
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognised as the first "non-gender" person in the world after a court had been allowed to maintain a "undefined" sex status for life.
In addition to M and W, German ID cards will have a third assignment, X for intersexual, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still more controversial, such a news on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French members of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition to remove the "gender theory" from school books.
The American website Catholic Online has also spoken out against German law, with the reason: "If the world is being dragged into a new state, where the gender is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we are turning two further pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland said to Baby Zone that it would be better if babies were assigned a gender at birth.
"Being a parent is already stressful enough, even without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your own child," she said the parent website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female parts of the sex were called hermaphrodite, according to the attractive Greek God who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, medicine considered the sex to be something that could be extinguished and then rebuilt.
But the ethical foundations of an operation are now being doubted after it is now known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong, because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the gender assigned by them.
"In the middle of the 20th century, one thing was called" psychiatric emergency, "" said Drescher.
When such a child was born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you called the surgeon.
The ruling theory of the treatment of children with indefinite genitals is based on Dr. John Money from Johns Hopkins University, who considered the gender to be formable.
He marked the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental attacks - as the parents raise a child - interacted with the genes and hormones of a child, and that a person considered himself male or female.
But in a case that became known as "John / Joan" in 1966, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated in a faked circumcision to castrate the child completely and also to remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but it was not," said Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman.
But at 38 he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the Internet moving in, survivors of these sex operations came to the public, which are "not happy with the result."
For example, with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were not aware whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said to ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was given a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized when I was born, and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After he had learned the truth, he changed back to male identity, received testosterone injections and had his breasts removed.
The operation has made him infertile.
Today, he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project to ensure that intersexual people are perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, the director of the California-based legal group of lawyers for informed choice, is concerned that the German law could "encourage stamping and stigmatizing."
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to" assign "the child, she said.
We fear that this will promote intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we still don't know how the law will work, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that their organization supports the Australian law, because "it allows adults to be recognised as third-sex."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex," she said.
The German law is about the allocation at birth.
This is not a fight to force little children at this time.
When they are grown up, they can decide their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a "brutradiologist" from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that the German law "empower" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in child psychiatry.
Although it is infertile, it hopes to have a child through adoption or a mother of loan.
"The law gives parents room, so they don't have to make decisions overhasty," said Baratz.
It gives them time to do different tests and to clarify things and gives them time before they write "male" or "female."
This way everything is fine - you raise the child and you love it.
You have a wonderful baby and you enjoy the happiness of your parents.
And you don't have to rush an operation that can't be reversed.
"This includes the children in the decision and removes the fear that the parents are overreacting because they think they are not doing the right thing," she explained.
In the end, the child decides on the gender that is better suited to him - and that is wonderful.
This will enable children to make the decision themselves.
Unknown hurt girls by shooting from car
The unknown have injured a 12-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt in a car shot.
The perpetrators had probably fired a group of children in Genthin on Thursday night with an air pressure weapon.
That's what the police told us in Castle.
The girl was slightly injured on the left.
Rescue took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed by a group of six children and had stopped suddenly.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disc broke.
Then they drove away.
The police were investigating it on Friday.
Until now, the police inspection of Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were only called twice to ovulate children who threw them against house facades.
Since the owners of the house recognized this in time and removed the remains of the eggs immediately, no material damage should have been caused.
In addition, some Sylvesterböller were also fired in the city area, but there was no material damage here either.
A resident in the Bishop-Freitorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped up with a toilet paper and his bike blinds were removed.
Until the police arrived, however, the man found all his bike blinds in the immediate vicinity, which is why the police did not have to continue to work.
Living with a future perspective
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives in a dream.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
The city is only a few minutes by public transport.
"I hope you're not afraid of spiders?," asks Waltraud Ries and points to a fat spider on the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for a while.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not a spider phobia, but the concern that at the age of not being able to cope with the many steps to the house and in the apartment, she explains.
In addition: Since a meniscus operation, the middle-fifties have had to know on their own what it means to move from floor to floor with handicap.
Recently, a book of her has appeared on the subject 'Happy living in old age - what kind of living is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what's not going on in old age ', she starts to tell.
When she moved with her husband to the Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago, it was just a nice apartment in the middle of the green.
Today at the middle of fifty, Waltraud Ries is thinking differently about it.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who deal with the subject of "living in old age."
Most of them are going to leave it as long as they can.
The old are always only the others', she says.
It's only when the pain pressure is really great that you're worried about it.
'Then it can be too late, 'says Ries.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 living models for a self-determined living in old age.
"But what form of housing one chooses is always an individual decision," she explains.
There is no solution for age.
Even those who can afford the retirement seat in Tuscany or Brittany should always think about getting sick.
And: 'Without a good knowledge of the national language, one also united in the Dolce Vita,' the author of the book gives to consider people who wish to leave.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative housing forms or the often quoted pensioner WG.
At the age, everyone has their ticks and flaws
'But for me, it would be nothing, 'she says, with an eye wink.
Not like a student WG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
"When you're old, you just need your retreat rooms," Ries says.
The book author does not want to rule out that a senior community can still work.
But this has to be done differently than in the classic student WG.
And sometimes you just want to rest, 'she thinks.
With this opinion, at least in the capital city, it is not alone.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as it goes, 'is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service life at the age of the capital.
Your service advises people on the subject of "getting older."
This is why the elderly would often also take on difficulties and restrictions in order to stay in their usual environment, which is also the experience of the Warentest Foundation.
Today there are many ways to make the house or the apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends that all those who are concerned with the age-friendly change of their home or their apartment should first of all be informed in detail and not to be the first to be the best craftsman.
Today there are also specialists for the age-friendly conversion.
Even in the rental apartment one can realize one or another, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior designer will be able to clear up.
But it is not always possible to redesign the existing apartment, even if it is so beautiful.
This experience had to be made by Waltraud Ries.
Although you could install a stairway within the apartment, the path paved with stairs to the door of the apartment would be the much greater obstacle.
She will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, she is more digging than before the spider at her living door.
USA want to continue to prosecute Snowden
The US has not changed its position on former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden.
He was still accused of being allowed to pass on secret information.
He therefore had to face criminal proceedings in the United States, said the US State Department spokesperson, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
The recent statements by Snowden would not change that.
Before that, German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbelle had called on the United States to stop threatening him with punishment after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow.
Psaki stressed that it was a member of the German government and not a member of the German government in the case of Strebel's statements.
The secret service unsub Edward Snowden is, in principle, ready for a conversation with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to be clear about his situation.
This was made clear by the former NSA staff who were sought by the US in an unaddressed letter published by Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and passed on to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the Federal Prosecutor General.
The letter has the following text after a translation by Ströbel:
To the competent authorities
I was asked to write to you about your investigation into mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden, who was previously employed as a direct technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the United States Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).
In the course of my work in these institutions, I was a witness to systematic violations of the law of my government, which led me to act on a moral basis.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I have been exposed to a serious and persistent incitement that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum that the Russian Federation grants me under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens all over the world and also high officials - including the United States - have considered the revelations to be a system of comprehensive monitoring that no one is responsible for, as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations led to many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the previously concealed abuse of public confidence.
The benefits for society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear and at the same time the risks involved have been significantly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts has been proven to be positive, my government still treats Dissens as a breach of faith and seeks to criminalise and prosecute political expression.
Nevertheless, speaking the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will take this harmful stance.
I hope that, when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved, I will be able to participate adequately and legally in the responsible clarification of the facts of the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to having a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is clear and thank you for your efforts to protect the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testified by Hans-Christian Ströbelen
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterling's mayor Michael Maier.
The municipality sold the former kindergarten in the Gartenstraße to a private person.
The Council agreed to the sale in its recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner at a "reasonable" price.
"The community is satisfied," Maier stresses.
The budget was EUR 100 000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has given responsibility for the building to someone else before winter and therefore no longer has to pay for the entertainment of the house, as to heat, to look at the garden and to clear the walk.
"This effort is now gone," Maier is pleased.
Space concert at high summer temperatures
The music club Hammereisenbach gives a place concert on the terrace of the guest house Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the clock at 7.30, the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
The chairman, Manuela Honeck, presented the music pieces.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully manage the first musical stool.
Report: Obama's campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisors have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, says the New York Times.
The unveiling is the most remarkable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's long-awaited work on the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012."
The Times is a copy of the book that will be published soon, and it reported on Thursday night that the president's top advisers had "carried out extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011" to find out if it would look better for Obama's swinging hope of re-election if he dropped Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, National Political correspondent of the Times, the book has a thorough record of the efforts of leading staff of the campaign and the White House, including the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the impact on the survey values of the exchange of former Foreign Minister Clinton against the Vice-President.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the President's closest advisers - including Daley, former campaign leader Obama, Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisor David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew about the planned change.
In "Double Down," it is claimed that Daley has been at the top of the effort to exchange bides despite their "close, personal relationship," before one finally decided against such a move, after the data showed that the candidacy of Clintons "would not significantly improve the chances of Obama."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said a whole series of things that you should consider, and that was one of them," Daley explained to the magazine.
You have to remember that the President had terrible survey values at the time, so we thought, "For God's sake, what are we doing?"
While Daley referred to the investigations as "due care," Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign for re-election, a considerable effort had been made to find out whether such a train was paying off in terms of the electoral channels.
"In campaigns, not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don't think about something seriously," said Martin on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN he asked Daley if his boss knew about the potential change.
Although Daley said he didn't think that the president was "aware" of the possible change, the former chief of staff admitted that it was "possible" that Obama had known about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question whether the political probations had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn't know about the investigation of whether to drop biden in the elections.
"Possible," Martin said.
What happens on the way with my e-mail?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
When designing the Internet service, has e-mail been technically implemented in the same way as the traditional mail?
In the design of the early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols have not been taken into account to create a stable basis for a hearing-safe exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If user "Anna" sends a mail to "Benni," are the computers of the two connected directly?
The email program or the browser of Anna sends the mail to the mail server of her service provider in the first step.
For example, if she has a GMail account, that would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider Benni uses.
On the route the mail can run via a number of other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content at his provider.
Are conventional e-mails read through the network on their way?
Most of the mails are read several times by software robots on the way.
At the provider of the sender, it is usually checked whether the mail carries a malicious program as an annex.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is a troublesome and unwanted spam mail that is deleted immediately or at least sorted out into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
In systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their coming holiday trip, Google can display appropriate links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the e-mails?
The probability of unauthorized persons reading a mail is very low.
Theoretically, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
The law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal opportunities to capture or take note of e-mails.
There are also possible illegal leeway actions.
Is it possible to protect emails from reading?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an email can be effectively encrypted against reading.
With a high technical effort it is also possible to hide the metadata of an email communication, so that it is not even easy to identify who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
According to a August 2013 study by Convios Consulting, Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the mainly privately used postal subjects.
While the shares of Yahoo-Mail had last fallen, GMail was able to make it clear by Google.
Mother in the forest is covered and pension is paid
When his begotten mother died, a man from Wolfsburg made a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pension and care.
A 67-year-old Wolfsburg has buried his dead mother after the police investigation in the forest to continue to pay for his pension and care.
First he covered up the death of the 89-year-old, then he cut the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old must be responsible for fraud, as a speaker said on Friday.
The man then hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was already suspected in May: At that time, it was noticed that no more drugs were needed for the nursing mother.
The pensioner told the investigators that his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because this was strange to the officials, they continued to find out.
It was found that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and he had last maintained it.
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother.
According to the police, there was no evidence of a capital crime.
Want some ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice in the dark - using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis made use of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a shining reading from them.
The idea came to him after he had read a research work on jellyfish and could convince Chinese scientists to artificially produce the shining protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue, which increases the pH in the protein and causes the light.
Chris explains that the ice cream is responding to the heat in the mouth and shines - so the more you lick, the lighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious," says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH-value increases and the ice shines.
We've tested it in the last few months and it seemed ideal for us to put it on the market on Halloween because it has this wonderful light effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever produced, because the jellylight is four times more expensive than gold.
Every bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes good for that.
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his latest creation is to be even more ambitious.
He says, "I'd like to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is impossible in itself and in itself because of the light-breaking caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I think we can find a way to make it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish that are artificially produced by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still in the Handball League after six days of play.
The team of Ingo Ehlers is now coming tomorrow to the Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game the season starts new for us.
"I hope that we finally have our heads free," Ehler's behaviour is optimistic.
At last, with the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he has his entire box at his disposal.
And Daverden, like us, is on the tempo game.
That is why we need to keep our error rate low.
However, first and foremost, it is important to increase the level of coverage, which has left everything but a certain impression.
After the first season of the season, Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz won the first round of the season against Nordhorn.
The game was, of course, a house number.
But that's why we're not the favorite for a long time, because in Derby, everything can always happen.
However, Panitz now wants to go back to Morsum to start a series.
Absence will be Jan-Malte Jodat.
For this, the A-youth Joost Windßuß, who is active with the A-Jugend-Bundesligist HC Bremen, is celebrating his season debut.
If you're not hot in a game like this, stay home.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late and dress us up for the neighborhood.
Today I have become more of a Halloween muffle.
In the last two years, I have not agreed to distribute candy from my apartment, and I guess I won't do it this year.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep in Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million to be precise - are celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and decorations, according to the American Federation of retailers (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will account for about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, moving unanimated objects are the last cry.
Women don't have to wear sexy clothes anymore, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburger or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk space men will make it to the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone in my amazement.
In fact, Americans spend $330 million this year on costumes of their pets, according to the NRF.
That's a lot of hot dogs.
As for candy, we're not cunning.
Americans are going to spend $1.9 billion this year, says The Nielsen Company.
This is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, lutters, candy and rubber bears.
So good news for the 41 million people, according to the US Ministry of Commerce, who are going through the neighborhood with the word "sweet or sour."
In fact, we are going to buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and - let's not make a mistake - eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of confectionery producers.
That's about nine billion corn grains.
It's a mystery I haven't been able to solve yet.
Nothing belongs to Halloween more than houses where it spits.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is in a real prison by the way), "Howl-O-Screen" and "The House of Shock."
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States that make $500 million in proceeds, says America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos on which you just pee in your pants and then put your friends on Facebook where you don't get rid of them, and then you leave a comment like "nice expression of face."
But let's finally get to the pumpkin.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great Pumpkin when we were children, and the cutting of a pumpkin lantern is like the adorning of the Christmas tree - something we did from a small open.
Fortunately, the "baby in the pumpkin" trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up to cut the pumpkin and not sit in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, which is slowly rotting in the front garden, is probably from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkin were harvested this year.
If you want to score correctly, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and cut something pretty out of their 921 kilos of pumpkin.
Housing fire in Helmbrechts: rescue forces are burying cold bodies
The fire brigade had to equip in Helmbrechts on late Thursday night.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire during the night to Friday.
The rescue forces are holding a coiled body out of the house.
In a fire in Helmbrechts, rescue forces found a coiled body in a three-family house.
Whether it is a resident is still unclear, as a spokesman of the police in Bayreuth said.
On late Thursday night it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire brigade arrived, the flames were already beating out of a window.
The forces went to the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The whole ground floor was damaged.
All other residents had not been home during the fire, the police speaker continued.
The building was no longer habitable for the time being.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest national church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of the pastor.
The background is a possible lack of pastor: The Evangelical Lutheran National Church of Hannover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors will halve by 2030, according to the current situation.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and day course itself.
With Burfien, the National Church has for the first time appointed a pastor in a full place to inspire young people to study theology.
At the moment, less and less young people decide to study theology after their graduation.
Burfien leads this back to the process of decirtification: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud."
The profession was characterised by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my schedule and I can set my priorities where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to the people as a pastoral guard.
They made as much money as teachers and could live on it.
There is certainly more pay in the free economy, but theologians would have a safe employer for that.
This is what young people from today, who are not just about career, but about a work that is full of sense.
According to the National Church, which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors are currently retired per year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their vicariat.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the resin, the Emland or the Wendland, it could be difficult to occupy jobs in the future.
Burfien wants to organize study days for young people, among others, and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
Theology studies provide a wide range of training.
You can even become Federal President with that.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior there are racing seats and six-point belts as well as a free-call system.
The options range from increased brakes, a service package with support from Bowler-Works-Mechanics and logistical support to vehicle deployment between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced racing drivers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as a reachable way to world-class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various Rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and to prepare newcomers for the streets and reality of Rally Raid.
We really had fun developing the Defender Challenge car - this will be a fun championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge has a training and test day in February, as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Fire brigade called for the rescue of a dog who was 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock head in a quarry
Cockerspaniel-bitch Ruby ran away after a smaller traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her misplaced position
Firemen severed on the rock wall and saved the dog from the safe death
The fire department managed to secure a dog who was stuck on a 15-metre-high lead in a rock wall.
The nine-month-old Cockerspaniel dog Ruby ran away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was saved from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20 of whom the dog belongs, came to the quarry flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to receive Ruby again and to thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately sought out their missing dog and published a call for help in social networks when she had escaped from the quarry after the small traffic accident.
Around 2: 15 on Wednesday, a walker who was running his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15-metre-high section in the quarry.
The technical rescue team at the Clickheaton Fire Station rushed to the spot and severed to rescue Ruby, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, specialist in the technical rescue team, said, "She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall - 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She didn't move a muscle during her rescue - she was like stiff-frozen.
But she's fine now.
She then ate a few dog cakes.
That was a pretty unusual operation.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, specialist in the technical rescue team, said, "Ruby was very lucky."
There was a possibility that she was very badly hurt or worse.
Ruby was brought to the vet, but he didn't see anything except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "Watching the rescue was frightening."
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep her in her arms again.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had become too large and it had collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
The firemen have done great things.
It was really brave what they did.
We're just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added, "We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed upstairs."
The firemen were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never turned on Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she worked as a background singer on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry said she had dinner with the Aldrucker, and that "he hit me when I was 18."
She added, "That was a long time ago and he was very nice to me."
In a statement, a representative Jaggers, 70, on Thursday, said that he "categorically denied that he had ever tried to approach Katy Perry."
The representative added, "Maybe she confused him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest performance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album, "Prism," landed at first place this week.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scots the choice
A new day, a new story of terror for independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire-secured border along the Hadrianswall.
In fact, the Strathclyde proposal referred to the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom of movement in the rest of Europe, but this did not, as expected, play a role in the headlines.
No one has also mentioned that EU Member States often have their strict rules in place when it is more favourable to them.
As Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, the continued non-respect for Brussels would only be a small concession in return for what one really wants from the Scots.
So, actually, no story.
And one that has come so in the years that it is already like a fossil: The first time I heard the "independence means passport control" duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient story.
Why should an independent Scotland expect it to dance after the European pipe?
Why exchange the London yoke for Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great post-war plan for European integration has been put into effect.
With the euro crisis, the Europe project has officially died.
All over the EU, parties are gaining ground that are EU-hostile or want to throw the euro on board as a Community currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party was able to hold almost five million votes for Germany in the Bundestag election in September, and thus effectively expel the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis is a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the forced jacket in which the national economy is forced to hold on to the single currency, many people believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits - that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has fixed its members to exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters - and German politicians would like to keep that up.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency, southern Europe is found with a built-in productivity disadvantage over Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public expenditure - driven by Berlin.
There is a deeper European productivity problem behind the current budgetary and monetary problems.
As a result of the "green" energy directives adopted by Brussels - a code for the subsidisation of French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers - European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times for gas compared with the United States.
This is a laudable cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Granmoouth.
All the world's wage regulations do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is rising, especially in France, the former EU cheerleader.
After the war, France's political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and to raise Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has pushed Europe's own economic policy, which has to do with the French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pen's legal, EU-enemy front national has just won a decisive post-election and thus the ruling socialists have referred to third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the voters' votes - a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with their newly won popularity among the white French of the working class?
It would like to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections - and this is very possible - then for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to go on: in the not too far future, the growing range of ideas against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become more of a "Europe of (sovereign) nations," which General de Gaulle preferred.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may hold on to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project in the hope of getting into the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where does Scotland stay with all this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the final consequence) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests - which should include saying what Berlin and Brussels can do.
I think Scotland could go very well in a more relaxed European association, provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider equating it to Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is - remarkably - the most successful political movement against austerity policy in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts that the Labour Minister of Finance, Alistair Darling, and the subsequent Tory-Lib Des Coalition, had to be responsible for.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to now opt for independence just to get a austerity policy from Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: growing up faster
African-American and Spanish girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white old-age friends, as studies show.
Physical changes do not mean puberty directly
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the epidemiological obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in young people
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter is already growing breasts and pubs at the age of seven or eight years?
At the annual conference of the Paediatric Association of American Academy of Paediatric Studies this week in Orlando, Florida, the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time calming parents down - usually this is no sign that puberty is now coming in quickly," said Kaplowitz.
The obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, sham and armpit hair as well as body smell, are shown in girls earlier.
However, there was only a slight shift at the age of the menarche (occurrence of the first regular bleeding) in the last 40 years.
The average age in the United States is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the development of the breasts begins, it will take at least two to three years to reach the Menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Early puberty among girls: The essential guide to dealing with this often occurring problem."
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial, which is actually the beginning of puberty, but it is "early" when the breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth surge of eight years ago.
In most cases the process slows down or stagnates - something that a pediatrician can closely monitor.
In case of faster progress, tests by an endicronologist may be indicated in order to avoid serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
There are treatment methods to delay early menstruation and the defence of another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and the emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is restrained in terms of drugs, but he admits: "The suppression of puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls to be different from their old-age friends."
The other big problem is understandable: parents just don't want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," remembers a woman whose daughter was given her days at ten.
Even though there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was emotionally not prepared.
She came home scared and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many well-published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other food, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be the cause of it.
Boys come into puberty like girls before.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years, which provides a link between body fat and the entry into puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Spanish girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white old-age friends.
There are different explanations for this.
Global, an early puberty seems to be influenced by all kinds of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although boys are growing face and puberty before, the trend towards a fully-fledged former puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is even common among babies and small children.
"We need to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to be advised by their pediatrician as they should talk to their child.
"This may mean that you have to have a conversation sooner than expected," said Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually responds well.
Girls who bloom early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers argue over seat width in the face of large orders
There has been a discussion between leading aircraft manufacturers about the width of seats in the tourist class in long-distance flights, which indicates the tone of a bitter collision on the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute is about the seating width that passengers are offered on long flights in the tourist class - not always those that are most interested in airlines, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency of the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
Airbus called for an industry standard this week, which requires a seating width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the American archrival Boeing says that the airlines should decide that.
The discussion comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturers are betting to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-range pilots, and at the event from 17 to 21 November expect record reports.
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed - in particular whether there are rows with nine or ten seats - is crucial for the economic results that the new "mini-jumbo" design is to provide.
Boeing claims that its modernized "777X" barrel 406 people sitting in the tourist class, which are over 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 has 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often distribute hives about technical details by advertising in the specialist press.
Airbus now appeals to the public directly before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race.
Recently, the company presented an ad that could be the beginning of a new ad war and showed money donors a picture in which three people sit together in a restaurant, and the title: "Would you accept that?"
"Boeing proposes long-distance flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo-props," says Airbus Sales Director John Leahy.
In view of the changes in diet, people are getting thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance journey, and the end of the century, the weight of the male average american between 40 and 49 years has increased by 10 percent, according to the data of the US Ministry of Health.
According to American health statistics, the waist size of the male average american in the 21st century is 100.8 cm.
Airbus says his rival is following a seating concept from the 1950s, when the average body size of the freshly baptized "jet set" was narrower.
According to Airbus, the tests were carried out that an additional duty (2.54 cm) per seat increased the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing denies the numbers of Airbus to the seating dimensions and says it is not at the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines make the balance between air fares and equipment.
The company also explains that according to research, the experience on the plane depends on more than the seating width.
"It is really up to airlines to give flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to be successful," explains the airport expert Kent Craver von Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is about more elbow-free, but for manufacturers it is becoming increasingly an issue that can have an impact on sales.
Behind the discussion is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion after list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the US or Europe's export balance.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seating layout is the driving force behind the discussion about the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-range designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
The statements of Boeins about the results partly depend on the fact that the 777X is compared to its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than for machines currently used with ten seats per row.
"Boeing therefore squeezes more seats on his plane to make it more competitive to our products," says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s indicate that many passengers chose the closer arrangement, which could be accompanied by cheaper fares.
"Eighteen inches of seating would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat of 777," says Mary Kirby, an expert in cabin facilities, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world-traveling jet-sellers even carry tape with them to measure the facility in the competition.
Even if they offer comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-density design for cheap flights and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat series, but has not sold one yet, according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered wide seats on the corridors for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to be plagued but could be distracted from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could make the pleasure of smoking the garden
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Before testing human beings, further tests are needed, which may take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
"We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop trying to try out all the methods available on the market, but had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant flow of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which means that a smoker does not experience a nicotine high.
In trials, vaccinated mice that were given nicotine maintained their normal level of activity.
In contrast, mice without vaccination would have taken a "time-out," the researchers explained a sign that the nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translative Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical.
But the costs of the new vaccine are probably significantly lower, because it turns liver cells into antibody plants.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if he was sure, could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
But more likely, smokers would use it to stop.
"They then know: when they start smoking again, they no longer feel pleasure with it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them to take off the habit," he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi denies having been influenced by Obeid
The former minister of the laboratory party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales is under investigation by the State's corruption control.
The former NSW Minister denies having changed the maritime lease arrangements at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden holdings in three land on state-controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) extended its investigation into whether Obeid had influenced various state ministers to extend lease contracts at the Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café without a call for tenders after their expiry in August 2005.
Now it is determined because of the accusation that Tripodi knew of Obeid's hidden interest in the land, after Tripodi's former Deputy Chief of Staff Lynne Ashpole had declared it so on Thursday.
In years of discussions that started in 2005, the government had pressed for public procurement for the lease contracts.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer running times.
In 2009, the lease contracts for the companies at the Circular Quay, which brought the Obeids $2.5 million a year, were extended without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was the port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally called for public tenders.
But he refused to make the changes to Obeid's requests, which, as Tripodi confirmed, had pushed for a redesign of the government's lease arrangements.
A telephone record submitted to ICAC showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had been transferred to the Ministry of Port after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
"Was the issue raised in these telephone talks the preparation of commercial leasing arrangements?," said Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," said Tripodi.
I don't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli fighter aircraft attack target in Syria, so official sources
Israeli hunting aircraft had attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, confirmed a senior government officer to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the target was, but said it was at least one.
According to Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has already carried out air strikes on missile supplies in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subject to "authenticity test"
The government is considering an "authenticity test" for foreign workers with 457 visas in the framework of extended measures.
If the test were to be introduced, it would use a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used for the occupation of unqualified jobs or as a back door for the promotion of family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government discussion proposal was published after the former members of the laboratory party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the government's comments on foreign workers because they could be seen as an insult by the neighbours of Australia.
"A loud statement such as," foreigners should be in the back "and," Australians first set up "are a very unpleasant setback in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market," she said to the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected - and if some in the region had an echo of this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The proposal for a discussion outlines twelve measures that were once envisaged by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
Minister for Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who asked yesterday for talks on human trafficking in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, and the others are still being considered.
If the "criterion of authenticity" is taken over, a person applying for a visa could be checked to determine whether "the application is real in cases where the applicant is related to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting undertaking or in person."
Companies could also be obliged to take account of the number of 457 visa holders, after in the past, hundreds of companies who wanted to support only a small number of workers have finally stopped.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum probably died of a heart attack after he arrived this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas island.
The disrupted nine-year-old son of the man who had come with him to Australia has been taken care of by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father's death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study was announced by the UK Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd it is proposed to establish high-speed connections between Scotland and the North of England already at the beginning of phase 1 in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said that the project "will bring Britain closer together."
The Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and Northern Ireland from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further road capacity and travel time improvements for Northern Finland and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel time of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together."
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the link between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is being improved thanks to HS2.
The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown Carmichael called for "unequivocal" commitment to the Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail link has the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time the economic power of Scotland also provides an argument for fast rail connections across the UK."
We are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland, which creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh link that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the report of inquiry with the British ministers next year and to taking the next steps together.
Rules on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian passengers must continue to switch off tablets and smartphones when they start and land, despite efforts in the US to loosen the rules for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers can read, see or play e-books on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in "flight mode."
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do so, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books when they start and land.
Australian companies observe the decision to implement which the US airlines have to do a lot of work, but do not pursue any direct plans to amend their rules.
The CASA Air Safety Authority also stated that the announcement will be looked at, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia continue to apply.
"The CSA currently has no specific rules on the use of electronic equipment on the aircraft," has been published.
The issue is subject to provisions requiring airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to follow the safety instructions given by cabin staff.
Virgin has already had talks with the CASA about an increase in the use of his Wi-Fi maintenance system on flights and says that one is open to changes, but these should be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the registration of electronic devices by the NASA, because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight," said a speaker.
Qantas said that it would be possible to stay with the current rules until further notice.
"Our current guidelines provide that electronic devices may not be used at the start and landing, and we do not currently have any plans to change this," said the company.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers and will certainly look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision has a different impact on US companies, depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate the radio interference from mobile devices and change manuals, training materials, hand-luggage programs and customer training.
"After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any level," the FAA announced.
In rare cases with poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to switch off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that more heavy equipment be stored safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seats when starting and landing.
Before the station against Schalke, BVB trailers with light rockets had provided ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced hard consequences.
Before the Friday game of the Bundesliga against the VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with a silence - at first.
It was an unfamiliar, almost already spendistic acoustics that offered to the viewer until just before the start of the German Bundesliga game between the German victor Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guest fans with their songs were heard.
The South Tribune, on the other hand, where the most faithful of the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stand, first presented itself exceptionally quietly: no songs, no calls for slaughter.
The podium of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the common fire, remained unoccupied.
And at the front of the gallery, a big flag of "Section Stadion Forbidden."
Only when the goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, as always the first BVB player entered the place, burned up short-term cheers.
When his team colleagues followed, there was loud singing and sore scarves - but not everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Tribune nothing was stirring.
The fact that the stadium speaker Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last days - Derbywin, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - did not make for celebration.
Only five minutes before the start of the capo the Capo climbed his podium - and the tension that can be touched by hands in a loud cry, as usual, was unraveled by the mood on the margins in the stadium.
The last was as always the South Tribune - and at last here was the loudest place in the stadium again.
And at the latest when with Anpfiff from the South Tribune the loud call "Derbywinner is up," was everything again as always.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Immediately before the Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the bVB-trailer were in the audience and fired to the place - and almost the goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller met.
The game was spilled late because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the tips of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and you believe Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fans.
"There will be massive incisions for the entire ultra-movement," the BVB boss announced on Thursday night at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an emergency measure, Watzke denied the Ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I have forbidden that," he said.
We cannot give up the zero-tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
In addition, the Ultras have been shown different possibilities of punishment - by Tuesday they now have time to choose one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will set a penalty by the end of next week.
"This is going to be a big deal," said Watzke.
One may be curious how the reactions to the South Tribune will then come to an end.
Pfandhuizen booming in Singapore as the crisis has arrived in the middle class
In a pawn house in the Bendemee shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of her daughters.
"My husband and I just bought a house, there's all my money in it," says Amirthalinga.
Although she made $3,000 every month (about €1,730) as an administrative employee and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not sufficient, she explains.
Indeed, demand in parts of South-East Asia - where the debt of households is increasing - is so high that ValueMax, where she has made her exchange, became the third pawn house listed on the Singapurian stock exchange this week.
The pledge of jewelry is not only a fast way to get money - 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga - but also almost as favourable as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, Pfandhuizen in Singapore requires an effective annual rate of 17 percent, which is just above the 15.4 percent that the United Overseas Bank requires, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, Pfandhuizen offers the advantage that there is no need to review the creditworthiness or evidence of income, which is why loans are possible faster than in banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region turn to pawnhouses after families feel the pressure of increasing living costs and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a more relaxed fiscal policy in the developed economies, families with lower and medium income are looking for pawnhouses to balance the difference with stuttering economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's growing budgetary debt, mainly through increasing mortgages, was described as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
The Agency considers that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest budgetary debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80% of GDP, an increase of 60% still in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has just come out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing export weakness and a decline in consumer demand.
"In the end, this means that, given increasing costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical ceilings in gold prices in the last two years have increased the trend towards the union of personal objects, as people use the opportunity to turn the family's jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the committed items are gold in the 200 pawn houses in the city state.
People say, "The gold price looks good, let's get Grandmother's gold chain and get it back next month."
The largest Thai pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20% increase in customers in its branches in recent months.
The growth in the pawn business is so strong that ValueMax, the operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only into neighbouring Malaysia - where the company operates four houses - but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, CEO of ValueMax.
The company is financing this with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it received this week with the Singapore stock exchange.
While some lenders were in the crossfire because of high interest rates, Yeah, it explains that Pfandhuizen not only offered more favourable interest than other lenders, but also did not directly increase the debt.
"Customers insult items they already own, and the liquid personal property does not increase the budgetary debt," she explains.
The lending business is increasingly socially accepted as short-term, secured financing.
Nor are all people using pawnings in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the ValueMax branch to fund gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers come to us from every social shift.
"These include well-being, who borrow something for a business or an investment in the short term, or small companies that need to bridge bottlenecks in cash flow," says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The secret service explorer Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany to clear up the ever-brighter NSA scout.
According to the presentation of the Green-Bundestag, Hans-Christian Ströbele, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the ex-secret staff would testify to a German prosecutor's office or to a committee of inquiry.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, said to the ARD magazine "Panorama."
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care
The Australian government insists on the hard conditions associated with the rescue package of over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that Commonwealth will take "immediate action" to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The financing for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MEP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has launched an emergency rescue package, which we believe is concerned with the unique challenges facing the state," said Plibersek today.
The 325 million dollar package includes 31 million dollars of emergency aid for election services.
A further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic interventions and treatment for grey star, are intended to eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for day-to-day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better after-care after stationary stays, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas of which I have been told by the hospital staff concerned that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian government.
The state had to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member Commission will be set up to ensure that the State provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the 325 million dollars would be of little use if "they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public Tasmanian health system to a more sustainable course."
However, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent aid, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to taking the state's public health system off the list of care," said Wilkie.
According to the government of the state, these elections will largely offset the recent cuts.
But the opposition's public health spokesman, Peter Dutton, is of the opinion that today's announcement is only a "patch solution."
"We are in the position today because the laboratory government has withdrawn 430 million dollars from the health system," he said to ABC TV.
It can't be that a government is pulling almost half a billion dollars out of the system and the Commonwealth is putting 300 million in it and then pretending to be good news.
Dutton asked Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux'adaptation of the novel of Denis Diderot convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but is also more difficult than necessary.
The action in France of the 1760s tells the grieving story of Suzanne, a young nobleman who is sent to the monastery by her family.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.

The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes him a qualky penniless for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, such a monitoring group
Syria had destroyed important facilities for the production of chemical weapons and gas ammunition, said the Global Chemical Weapons Monitoring Group on Thursday, while there were serious clashes in the north of the country near one of the sites where likely toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian group of activists announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed three years ago since the start of the civil war.
The announcement of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the date of
1 November, which the organization Damascus, based in The Hague, had set up to destroy all equipment for the production of chemical weapons or to make "inoperable," including all machines for mixing chemicals into toxic gas and filling ammunition.
The conclusion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to start to destroy the existing weapons and supplies.
According to assumptions, there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when, on Thursday, fighting took place in the city of Safira, where experts say that there was a production facility for chemical weapons and storage sites here, as the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, based in the UK, reported.
The group of activists, who are following the number of dead people through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120.296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29.954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18.678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 fighters of the opposition, many of them foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict to be 100,000 since March 2011.
This number has not yet been updated.
The conflict has forced about two million people to escape the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira for weeks, many of which have connections to al-Qaeda groups.
The Observatory said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention any details.
The struggles underline the danger that the chemical weapons inspectors are exposed to, because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which is working closely with the United Nations, the team is "now convinced that it has seen and witnessed all the important production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by Syria."
Therefore, "no further inspection activities are currently planned."
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had stated that they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 out of 23 of the sites indicated by Damascus.
The inspectors said that it was not possible to visit two institutions because of safety concerns.
On Thursday, the OPWC stated that the two sites had been "abandoned..." and the objects of the chemical weapons programme that were available there were transferred to other said facilities that were inspected. "
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
"I take the hat off of the bravery and courage that you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organisation," said Ahmed Uzumcu, the Director-General of the Monitoring Organisation, in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war have been fighting against Assad's government and their security forces, many of which belong to the Alavites, a division of Shiite Islam.
In view of further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said that there had been a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion was not known, he explained.
Anger over judgment for bombers of Bali
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who were killed in the 2002 bombing in Bali, were angry at the verdict for the last of the instigators to be brought to justice, as Umar Patek, in her view, should be shot under the law.
Patek, who was on the run for almost ten years as one of the most sought-after people in South-East Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the construction of explosives for the bombing.
He could be released after 15 years with a suspension.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
A debt was also made in a number of terrorist charges, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution had called for a life sentence, even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man who, because of his reputation as a master bomber, was also called "Demolition Man."
The decision has aroused painful memories of June Corteen, a mother of Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twin-daughter Jane and Jenny in the devastation that Patek and his co-conspirators made almost ten years ago.
Fighting with tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"You should put him in front of a shooting command," said Corteen to AAP.
I have to live every day with not having any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was equated to the ground when on October 12, 2002 a huge bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub just after 23 o'clock.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber had a backpack filled with explosives exploded.
He fell into a coma for a month after the attack and "died" three times, while hanging from a life-support system.
Hughes said that Patek earned the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were responsible for the massacre and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before everyone else.
Let him live - no, there's no reason to let him live.
It's not much to get 20 years after he killed 202 people and hurt many hundreds.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be in court.
He was arrested for almost a decade, but was finally taken up in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011, where US forces nearly four months later killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent said that secret service reports had provided evidence that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of reestablishing the link between South East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't turn himself in," said Corteen.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he has caused to other people.
The verdict was made before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year, which is celebrated with commemorations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but do not have phone calls)
From departure to landing, passengers can now use their electronic equipment to read, work, play, listen to music and watch movies, but do not call with their phone, according to the new guidelines published by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
As soon as they were implemented, depending on the airline, FAA staff Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
Airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of the flight crew and the rules for the storage of the equipment in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to develop the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could very soon approve the extended use of electronic devices," the FAA announced in a release.
Currently, passengers have to turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
You may not start it again until the plane has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain gives green light.
When entering the landing approach, passengers will have to turn them off again and they will not be allowed to start again until the plane has landed.
According to the new directives, airlines whose aircraft were secured against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the equipment even when they were launched, landing and on the rolling field, said the FAA.
Most of the new aircraft and other aircraft that have been upgraded to larger heights for the use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the professional association of professional flight crew members, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation is safely implemented - and we work closely with the airline in this respect - both sides will benefit from it," commented Glading.
We are, to be honest, tired of having to feel like a caregiver on this subject.
However, Internet connections to surf, exchange e-mails, text messages or download data under three kilometres were still prohibited, the Authority explained.
Passengers are invited to put smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So still no "Words With Friends," the Scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines effectively because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked on the sidewalk.
And more heavy devices such as laptops must continue to be stored because there is a risk of injury in case they fly through the cabin.
Cell phone calls during the flight will continue to be prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.
FAA may remove a ban on certain electronic devices at start-up and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transport Safety Board, said security experts on national transport issues on CBS News, mobile phones would still be considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could cause potential disturbances in navigation equipment, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also interfere with transmission masts," Rosenker said.
A consulting committee of the industry, set up by the FAA to examine this issue, recommended last month that the government should allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on the FAA has increased to loosen restrictions on use.
Critics such as the democratic senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri are of the opinion that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the equipment has become omnipresent.
In some studies it is said that up to one third of passengers forget or ignore the switch-off of the device.
The FAA started to limit the use of electronic equipment by passengers in 1966, after reports of disturbances of navigation and communication equipment by the VHF radio carried by passengers, which were the latest technical trend at the time.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they do not make any electronic interference.
Airlines have been providing Wi-Fi to passengers for a few years when the height of the flight is reached.
The planes adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more sensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the increased use of electronic equipment under the new directives, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally provide much less radio than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, only give out minimal radiation when you are being overturned.
But when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
One of the supporters of a relaxation of the restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems, but could not find any.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd of the Passenger Association National Association of Airline Passengers said he felt that the interference from the devices was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there are only isolated reports of pilots who speak for a malfunction of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them are very old.
The Committee, however, recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order the shutdown of the equipment by passengers in the event of an instrument landing under bad conditions of vision.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them a reasonable adjustment for travellers who would now be fully equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognises that a pleasant passenger experience is not in conflict with safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Rereleased bird by air-repelling service from North Sea drilling island
A bird flown to the coast by air, which was found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island, was released into nature again.
The water trap was flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was paged by the Scottish animal protection organization SPCA in their rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said, "This water trap was probably a winter-long train bird from northern Europe, who was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea."
Apparently, the exhausted bird was seeking refuge on the drilling island.
He added: "He couldn't fly any more, so we were contacted with the request for help."
When it was released, the water was back to fit and healthy.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with the United Kingdom?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention to bring the economy to a table and to define what those in the UK want to change our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 economic leaders, who represent around the UK's size, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and are focused on countries that are modernising and growing, while EU countries are stagnating.
They wish that new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil will be favored from the government side, rather than being involved in the long and hard process of reforming the EU's obscure institutions.
In their view, the majority of economic leaders believe that control of these key competences should be brought back to Westminster, from antitrust to product legislation.
There was general dissatisfaction about the internal market, because according to the companies, the costs of the Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe's trading area - even 40% of large companies agreed with that, which are traditionally the most European-friendly.
Finally, and this is probably the most important thing to say, our survey of economic leaders showed that a clear majority of the UK wants a course towards the change of the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade not on politics.
This knowledge, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading companies, shows that the economy is pressing for a "meaningful change" that brings the issue of action back to the UK.
It is about a lot - an amendment to the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a 16% change of opinion in favour of the EU's stay in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind its plan to renegotiate the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a renegotiation to make a significant shift in power relations back to the UK.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the euro area is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which means a stronger focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Alexei Miller von Gazprom described pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas era
The start of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria is one of the largest European energy projects, the Gazprom Board of Directors said.
"Today's event is a milestone: the construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," said the chairman of the board of directors of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, on Thursday in a statement.
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is intended to provide more diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, in which most of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, provides for an increased risk in conventional routes, as can be heard from the official side.
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were "forever" eliminated.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at reduced rates when the whole project is in operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, the construction work is to start in other downstream countries on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way past the real estate site of Germany.
The economic framework data are correct and the funding opportunities are excellent.
This has been the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country in the European comparison.
This is what Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed out on the 9th day of the stock exchange.
As German commercial real estate is sought, the view of the transaction volume is shown, Ulbrich says.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the previous year.
In the UK, the increase was only 6%, and in France, 19%.
"Real estate investments offer an attractive interest," said Ulbrich.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds was at an historically high level.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees charged with charges against Jonathan Lord for sexual crimes
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were charged with sexual crimes related to children before allegations were brought against child caretaker Jonathan Lord from Caringbah in 2011, as the Royal Commission for Sexual Abuse of Children experienced.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA had stated that "there was never an incident of sexual child abuse in the organisation."
Managing Director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case where a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography and another where a sports teacher at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of abuse of his children.
Hare told Gail Furness, a Commission-assisting lawyer, that he knew about the first case but did not know the second.
He admitted that the opening statement of the YMCA to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that "there have been external reviews of the YMCA in which the YMCA was recognised as at the forefront of child safety."
Evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started at the YMCA at 21, admitted that the management had failed "from me to the bottom" in the recruitment of Lord and did not ensure that employees had been aware of their obligations to report violations of the guidelines on child safety.
Lord had been sentenced to 12 boys for sexual crimes at the beginning of the year during his two-year work for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
However, Hare argued that the YMCA had a cultural problem that had prevented employees from reporting to Lord's violations of the safety of children.
The employees said that they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, that they were private as babysitting, that they let them sit on his lap, said to one that he loved it, and that children had to play with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior was Lord and who had asked for a training for child protection because she was concerned about his behaviour, said that the child service manager Jacqui Barnat, who was the head of the YMCA Caringbah, was "very intimidating and most of the time very inimitable."
The managing director stated that he would not accept the statements of employees that they had not dared to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, rather, their friendship with Lord has affected their judgment, which is why they would not have reported him.
Hare stated that he had informed the board of the YMCA NSW that the lesson that the organisation had to draw from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was "not reporting" by employees, and the board agreed to it.
Hare said that the decision to press the staff to sign the confidentiality obligations shortly after the charges were made was made by the YMCA's managing director of the children's services, Liam Whitley.
He said that this should prevent the contamination of the evidence, but this has been "overhasty" and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not an organisation safe for children during the period when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on sexual child abuse, the Commission.
He explained that there had been "serious problems" in hiring, checking, processing, training and supervision of the staff.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair stated that he would use the chance to return as British Prime Minister - but admitted that a comeback was unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his resignation from office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic policy issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided speaking about British policy, and his comments are mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as an envoy to the Quartet of Peacekeepers in the Middle East.
On the question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London, saying, "Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so..."
When the horse show experts came to Cardiff to cut the horse of the year, they were aware that a hard competition was imminent.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, which is not even in the kindergarten and only took its first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee carried loose through the three rounds and took the first prize - leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both of them the same size, were praised for their appearance, behaviour and style at the annual competition held by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
At his performance in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had put his plate cap in a strange angle and led the two-year-old Toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural skills in dealing with the pony that was far above his age.
And Toffee got the best of his appearance and his personality.
Fenton had received Toffee as a gift for his third birthday last March and has been practicing with the Shetland-Pony every day since.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, "Fenton and Toffee are a great spur."
They had to compete against the entire field of participants and went off with gold poker and rosette.
It was only the second time that he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all excited when he won.
A total stranger in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howell, who has been showing horses for more than ten years.
Howell said, "The whole audience was as electrified as it was, and they all fired and clapped on him."
He ran on sand the whole length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares about.
The way he started it won't be long until he's on the "horse of the year" show - and I'm sure he'll cut it off.
A speaker of the annual horse show said, "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony."
Together, they're a great team.
The judges evaluated Fenton and Toffee for how well they would have beaten and presented themselves in the performance ring.
They are looking for good cooperation between Pony and Führer - and then Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's sweet clothes contributed her part to it, that was really perfect for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be "reformed" after call
A Chinese newspaper, which on the front page had called for the release of a reporter who had been accused of defamation, was to be reformed, said a press regulator.
The New Express, based in Guangzhou, had printed a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on TV that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports about a local company.
Now the New Express is subject to "comprehensive reclassification," the regulatory authority said.
The "Rectification Order" was issued by the authorities for press and publications, radio, film and television in Guangdong.
The preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, which is a member of the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several incorrect reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly," the regulatory authority announced in a statement.
She said that it was decided to "impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and to withdraw his reporter's license."
In addition, "the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to complete the reactivation of the New Express and recommended to identify the relevant leaders at the New Express and to immediately review the New Express's management team."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, in which he reported alleged financial irregularities with a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports for payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he explained to the state news station CCTV.
I did it first of all because I was looking for money and glory.
I realized I was wrong.
After Chen's apology, the New Express published an apology on the front page and said that it was not possible to check the reports correctly.
Several known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced, despite a change of law in the beginning of the year in which the authorities were forbidden to force someone to accuse themselves.
Drying tunnel discovered with own rail between the USA and Mexico
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric rail operation, has now been discovered.
The US authorities described the 120-90-centimeter tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they'd ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in the zigzak pattern over a length of just under six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area, which makes it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported undetected, the authorities explained.
In the discovery of the tunnel, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were guaranteed, according to the records of the court.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were charged with the possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They threaten prison sentences between ten years and life in a debt.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered since 2006 in San Diego.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, which presents the drug cartel with the challenge of how to quickly bring its product to the consumers.
In 2010, authorities found an almost 640-metre long passage with rails, which ran from a kitchen in a residential building in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
actor Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two-year-old Flynn.
The actor Orlando Bloom has expressed his opinion on the separation from his wife, the top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric, who was supposed to be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "Life sometimes does not go exactly as we plan or hope."
Kerr and he still loved himself, stressed the 36-year-old.
"We will support each other and love each other as parents of Flynn."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and their son Flynn was born in 2011.
According to Lexica, veganism is subject to vegetarism, but it is different from this in a very significant way.
For while vegetarians are allowed to eat cream, ice or a strong emaster, these flaws are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the renunciation of meat and fish, the vegan leaves away from all consumption of animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains to be asked, but when you look closer, the vegan food world is characterized by a considerable amount of imagination.
"Bread shows are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, which has a wide range of special products for vegan.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the store in the Domgasse.
For 13 years the native New Zealand has been living vegan, in Lampertheim he has (almost) found everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian."
At the turn of the century, the next step was taken and I became a vegan.
"The conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, who prefers artificial leather to normal leather.
He realized that other everyday concerns are also possible without animal products.
First of all, being vegan is an ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," Proctor says the maximum of the vegan, which covers the entire consumption behaviour.
Instead of following burgers, scrambled eggs or rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered whole new products, the enthusiasm increased.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, being vegan is not a forsaken, not an ascetic, but an enrichment." The assumption that with the food conversion you reduce the selection of food options, Proctor is more likely to return to the power of habit.
And precisely these conditions made some still so well-known attempts fail.
"The addiction factor is a very crucial factor that allows many to give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor makes a comparison.
And turn to it: "Certain taste shall not be made to hold on to the beast."
Often it is the spices or the kind of preparation that make up the taste.
"But you can also create the same effect in other ways," the vegan explains.
For example, Proctor brings aubergines, mushrooms and a few vegan sausages to a barbecue.
He is looking for a balanced, varied diet, in which it should also taste a good taste.
Of course, you want something between your teeth, that's legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste, but it's not just to reduce animal food," Proctor said.
He did not suffer health damage to food disorders, another widespread assumption.
For me, the change had a positive aspect.
I don't take foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who feed exclusively vegan.
"My blood levels are fine, I get checked out a lot," says Proctor.
In particular, many vegansimus critics warn of the lack of vitamin B12.
"As animals are fed with feed, rather than grazing on the pasture, it is questionable whether the meat that is bought in the cold, the vitamin B12 content is high," is found Proctor.
For Veganer there was also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are fine," he explains.
There was no need to go wide-ranging ways of promoting food procurement.
After all, there are basic food everywhere and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products.
I'll find everything I need on the spot.
I only buy something special once in a while.
"Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but that is how it is known for" ordinary "finished products."
However, the preparation of vegan courts was much cheaper and less time consuming than generally accepted.
"There is a lot to discover in the kitchen, with a few small cuts you can achieve good, if not partly better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with his vegan cheese cakes Proctor could also make his in-law parents wonder.
Family festivals give the vegan a new seasoning.
This has dynamics, when you cook together, it has a new importance.
"The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
But of course he was also brought up with skepticism.
You don't like my food any more?
"Should I feel bad now, because I drink milk?" - with such questions one must act as a vegan with a finger-tip feeling.
"I do not reject people, I am part of this society," Proctor does not want to be enclave.
And in more detail, the everyday world does not seem as vegan as suspected - and the vegan does not seem as limited in everyday life as commonly accepted.
Fast food is also allowed.
There are fries everywhere!
"Many döner shops offer falafel, or just a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he is on pasta dishes, or just ordering a pizza without cheese, all a question of habit.
The restaurants are so slow to adapt to it.
"When I started feeding vegan 13 years ago, everything was even more difficult," the New Zealand can find a development: "You have to talk to people, make them aware of it."
"If there are enough questions, they may be inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegane restaurants develop, such as the Combüse in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfreie.
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least a vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they're exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"On the other hand, meat dishes are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," says Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, Veganism is a safe way to make the most of it impossible from the outset," says Proctor.
However, the purchase of vegan products could be a little difficult at the beginning.
In particular, when you learn to understand that even in peanuts animal additives can be used as a dye, you seem to be rapidly leaving the courage with the respect of ethics in so many hurdles and traps.
Not only for this reason have Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are added to food but also cleaning products.
"You gradually develop a scanner view and know what signs and logos you have to pay attention to" It is sometimes better to do small steps than to stand or stumble, "knows Proctor.
Veganism, it is an important moral fingertip that strikes the consciousness.
Maybe he's not quite able to get his habits done, but at least he can teach the consumer to question his habits critically.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in breath.
The trade on the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon German time.
In a communication, the operator made technical problems responsible.
The other 11 US options markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger gaps with the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday the indices of Nasdaq had not been calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport.
In August of this year, there had been two breaks in one week alone.
First, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent a massive number of defective purchase orders to the option markets due to technical problems.
As a result, the stock exchange operators needed almost a whole day to look through and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of the total stock trade in the US came to an end because of a computer gap on the Nasdaq stock exchange for several hours.
In addition, last year Facebook's stock market access had provided an opportunity to look up.
The Nasdaq systems had not been able to cope with the flood of purchase and sales orders, later established the SEC's stock exchange supervision and donated the company to a record fine of $10 million.
Constance: Radler goes around 63-year-olds
The accident was reported by the police when a 26-year-old man on Thursday night, around 22 o'clock, was on the left-hand road from the station to the market place with a women's bike.
When a 63-year-old man suddenly came from a local on the walk, according to the police, the cyclist was no longer able to brake in time.
At the next collision, the pedestrian was pressed against the house wall, went to the ground in the further course and drew a 15-centimeter long square wound to the head.
An ambulance team took the injured to the hospital for medical treatment.
British police are giving Assange an extradition order
The British police today gave an extradition order to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said that the 40-year-old Australians had been given a "call to turn themselves in," which asked him to appear in a police station, and added if he did not follow it, he was threatened by arrest.
Assange is threatening extradition to Sweden because of the charge in a sexual offence, after its possibilities have been exhausted under British law, since the Supreme Court has rejected its opposition to extradition at the beginning of the month.
As he is afraid that Stockholm will deliver him to the United States, on 19 June he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has "sent a call to a 40-year-old man to join a police station at a time we have chosen," said a speaker.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release for bail.
The message did not comment on the service of the police call.
Assange fears that he will be delivered from Sweden to the United States and will be charged with possible spying charges, after having published more than 250,000 diplomatic news on WikiLeaks's unveiling website.
The driver who was grated between the legs with 210 km / h and hot drink will receive a penalty of £1,000
A car driver was imposed a penalty of £1,000 because he had been driving with up to 210 km / h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drink cup between his legs.
Before the Colchester Court, Howie was guilty, without having had the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay a cost of £90 and a sacrifice grant of £100.
Tax on foreign property owners against London's speculation bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of Chancellor George Osborne, who in the 2012 budget had imposed a 7% stamp tax on apartments that cost more than two million pounds as well as annual fees for buyers who hold apartments as a company and not as individuals.
Already now, the income from the stamp tax on housing in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which in 2012 / 13 was 708 million pounds, together the proceeds for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Northeast, Northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: "After the increases in the stamp tax on high-price apartments and the introduction of the related legislation against circumvention, it is difficult to say that high-quality property is too low-tax, regardless of the effects of the outdated municipal tax system."
"But this step could make some foreign investors more reluctant in terms of the purchase of real estate in London, or stop owners from selling it," he added.
First-class real estate - the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price - in the wealthy London South West belt, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, has been taxed at the record value of 11.8% last year.
The prices in Central London showed a steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging "domestic market," where the south-west part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, such as a study of Savills.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the context in which a dog's swallowing is associated with his mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with their tail waved more to the right (from the point of view of the dog), while it was the left side of nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and react to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "In humans, it is well known that the left and right half of the brain react differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the side tail of their fellow species, the researchers are monitoring the animals while these movies were looking at other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged and analysed the behaviour.
Probably soon we'll understand why the tail is moving in one direction, in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: "We have shown the dogs to films with dogs - either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we have thus been able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or to the right."
When the animals saw an otherwise expressive dog moving his tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the waving dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail-tilt was primarily left (again from the perspective of the dog that wanders), their heart rate increased and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements.
He is rather convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience what movements they should be worried about and when not.
He said, "If you have different encounters with other dogs and the weaving with the tail in one direction is more connected with friendly behavior and the right side produces more of a less friendly behavior, then you respond on the basis of these experiences."
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand their animal's emotions.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behaviour and guest scholarship at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Bristol, said that this was not the first study to examine whether the dog was important to the left and right.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University found out that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it's a satisfied dog.
In another research work at the University of Victoria in Canada, the following was said: "Dogs go more towards a robot dog when they are" tail "waving left and not right, rather than getting restless - just the other way around than in the Italian study."
According to his statement, the differences could therefore be that in the various studies the dogs did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
"Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two halves of the brain are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined - and dogs are no exception," Bradshaw said.
But as their behavior is easy to record, it probably won't be long until we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other direction.
Arctic Monkeys moving performance in Glasgow because of the disease Alex Turner
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has moved a performance in Glasgow after their lead singer has had a throat infection.
The band from Sheffield was supposed to play in the Hydro on Friday.
However, because of the illness of lead singer Alex Turner, the concert must now be moved.
The band's announcement came after she had to move a performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys announced: "After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys also have to cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1."
"Alex Turner was diagnosed with a throat infection, which is why he can't occur."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham is now taking place on November 20, which was moved to November 21 in the Hydro in Glasgow.
All tickets are valid for these shows.
We apologize to all the ticketholders for the inconvenience that this has caused.
Please contact the customer service at the sales offices where you bought your ticket if you need further support.
Pope Francis appointed first Cardinals in February
Pope Francis will be called new Cardinals of the Catholic Church on 22 February, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also the ones who choose a Pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached an age of 80 can no longer take part in the Pope's election - that is to say, a group of 120 "elected cardinals."
In a statement in which the news was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a speaker of the Vatican, said that a meeting of all the cardinals would take place before the ceremony was held to appoint the new cardinals, which is also known as the Consistorium.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistency in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of elected cardinals will probably have fallen by February.
He said that a Pope would normally appoint as many cardinals as necessary, so that the number of eligible cardinals would be 120 again, and as many cardinals over 80 as he would like.
The consistency next year was important because it was the first since the election of Francis in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment there has been a certain overhang on Europe's sides, and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they only have a small number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He said it was "well possible" that Francis asked the Cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this situation - all of this is completely new.
Valero said that the bishops from large places would typically be called cardinals, but Francis is "full of surprises - so we don't know who he is."
GM calls back new pickup trucks in the USA to repair the seat back
General Motors are calling back nearly 19,000 of its brand-new Chevrolet Silverado- and GMC Sierra pickup trucks with year 2014 to solve a problem with the manually adjustable seat rest, a communication from the US regulatory authority on vehicle safety on Friday.
For some of the cars there may be a defect in the mechanism for replacing the front seat rest.
For this reason, they do not comply with the federal directives on vehicle safety for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is driven from the back, it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the occupants so that there is an increased risk of injury," was read in the message on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The recovered models were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of GM trucks started in June and is the main model start of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners about the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA was unable to check the letter of notification due to the 16-day government shutdown, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, increased by 20% in the first ten months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16.503 Sierra pickup trucks.
The GM share increased by 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
A Obama-voter's desperate cry
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible
He says that Obama has made commendable efforts that have been evaded by the blockade tactics of the Republicans
The blockade policy does not apologize to the website problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks
Obama's memoirs about the 2008 election campaign were a sad memory of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at Harvard Medical School in the second year.
I'm reading a very sad book right now.
It's a book I thought would cheer me up during the second year of my medical studies and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacy to Win" and describes the memoirs Barack Obama for the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patient records in the evening and go to bed, the book will lead me back to a time when politics inspired millions and could take a speech from a breath.
The election became a landslide and news speakers stopped to see the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates wept with joy, and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama moved to office in 2008, he had 82% approval.
And then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a bad awakening as if you were being ripped out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times - they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed possibilities.
In the years since I first voted, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced silence of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I too believe that the party-political blockade tactics have gone too far, with which our nation should be brought forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, to name just a few.
But once I have defended the Obama government to colleagues and acquaintances countless times, I have come to the end of my attempts to explain.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it is possible to allow foreign heads of state to be heard or to kill innocent children by means of drones in overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of Americans and why whistleblower are being punished to reveal state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without proceedings, nor why the public funding and expenditure limits are being circumvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report that says that the White House's efforts to calm the media are the "most aggressive... since the Nixon government."
And recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
I should have understood at 18 that government work could be contrary to the previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the House of Representatives is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre form the public debate.
But when I look at the above examples, they seem to have been largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I chose Obama again in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unsolved alternative, he didn't seem to be able to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term of office for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would satisfy the hope that we had heard of for so long.
But with the fall in Obama's acceptance values to less than 45% this week, the return to 2008 through this book has become so much harder.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have dissolved into the air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to put a serious loss against Clinton in the Pennsylvania pre-election.
In a meeting with the electors after the decision, he told his employees to come back on course and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I want us to find our magic again," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more with you.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflicts of interest in parental leave
The billionaire and MEP Clive Palmer said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters were pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnat, in a court debate on the payment of $6 million in CO2 tax, made the claim when he wanted to wipe questions off the table as to whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for deciding whether the CO2 and mining taxes are deleted or reduced.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughters of Abbott would personally benefit from the laws.
"He is in a great conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she is on leave," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission of Palmer officially declared the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax with 53 votes in favour after the reelection.
Palmer called for a revision of the vote counting process to speed it up.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system where you march in, enter data into a computer, immediately choose and then at 6: 30 in the evening have the result?
Palmer also criticised the use of pencils when marking the ballot papers.
Do you use them because you can then erase the results if you don't like them?
It's incredible to vote with pencils today.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and has recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said that his policy included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office "very seriously."
A public office is about public service.
"We are not looking for any reward but for history, namely that we can serve in a critical time of this community," he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, two people who are familiar with the situation, and this is another indication that the global public investigation into the alleged manipulation of the currency market is rapidly taking place.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed their cooperation with the authorities in the investigation in the world's largest financial market, where US $5.3 billion a day change the owner.
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that the scandal of the Libor Interbank business is taking place.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities.
"Our investigation on this issue continues and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities," said the Bank two weeks ago.
Last month, close to the situation, the RBS reported that the records of e-mails and instant messages sent to and from an earlier dealer were forwarded to the British Supervisory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS 2010 and is now to have been suspended from his current position as European head of the Forex spot trade at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European spot trading at Citi, was on leave this week and Matt Gardiner, former leading currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these dealers were accused of any misconduct.
The Usher Instant Message Group included bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup, said the situation close to the people.
UBS announced this week that she had taken steps against some of her employees after the Swiss regulatory authority Finma declared that she was investigating an alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are currently dealing with allegations that bankers should have agreed on transactions in the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said with the situation trusted persons.
Banks have been through instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news about these investigations has put traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units in investment banks in recent years, but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play down the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
One leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trade, the fragmentation of liquidity between the different trading platforms and the increasing use of its own internal platforms by banks "can influence the market with very low ticket prices."
The message came out the same day when Credit Suisse announced that she had quit a dealer of her London Exchange traded funds office this week after he had caused a loss of just under six million dollars at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed and works with the competent authorities.
"We are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter is contained," said Credit Suisse.
Painted the construction fence on the Bechtle plot
A group of citizens' initiative "Swiss meadow" has embellished the building fence on the Bechtle land at the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
She also cleaned and spread the footway, it is said in a press release.
The planned cover of the house in the back of the property had not been allowed for safety reasons, because the site is threatening to drain.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed to the beauty action with his colleague Reinhard Domke of the BI.
Before the action of the BI a transparent with the message "We are for it" had been placed.
This did not, however, bother the about 20 members of the citizens' initiative in their action.
Her motto on the big poster was "We are against building ruins."
She wanted to point out the danger of even greater ruins on the Swiss meadow - the huge project should one day fail.
In the discussion with many passers before the "construction site" it became clear that some citizens believe that many will be better with the implementation of the city's project, although few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they start to sign, because the city is further delayed in these answers, it is said by the BI.
As it was heard, the public statements of the mayor also have an impact.
In May, at the municipal council meeting, he said that he was afraid of the end of the thermal bath if the people were to vote against the plans for a swimming and wellness complex in the Swiss meadow when they decided to take a decision.
Some seem to be very scared, others feel that they are "plump blackmail" to the population, as the BI press release says.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick-Schelte for Schiris: Mane no swan king
As Ralf Rangnick is satisfied with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, the sports director of the "cops" was disappointed by the referee.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of swallowers," he took protection of the two offensive wreaths on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The most recent occasion for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane at 3: 0 against Greatness last Sunday, where Senegalese became a supposed act to be a crime - which, of course, was not, as the TV pictures showed.
"A very bad decision," said Rangnick, who called referee Harkam "completely overhauled."
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Gödig coach Adi Hütter after the game.
He defended his German countryman: "I would have acted like Roger Schmidt in every single situation."
Schmidt himself does not want to have any contact with his colleague after the scharmützel with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"For I am the one who was offended," said the 46-year-old.
However, in view of the success, Rangnick agreed to a hymn of praise.
"There are only two words for this: really good," he said.
There's not much to put off.
The way the team plays is particularly impressive.
I want this to go on like this.
Framework changes in the winter transfer time will hardly exist.
There are no great reasons to change anything.
"Except for a player who wants to leave the club," Rangnick made it clear.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's Health Act
It is a great victory for the Obama government: the US Supreme Court today decided that the closely linked health law with Barack Obama is constitutional.
By five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - it forces US citizens to make health insurance or to pay a penalty by 2014 - is constitutional within the framework of the State's tax authority.
The top judge John Roberts struck the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while the judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided to do so.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and also considered that the provision of the Health Act, which states should either extend the conditions of access to Medicaid or otherwise remove all state Medicaid support, was not unconstitutional.
The appeal against the law was initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was strongly rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place is making light with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their dark valley.
Due to the low level of sunshine, the Rjukan in the Vestfjord valley usually sinks in the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three giant reflectors at 45 meters height, a century's dream was realized on Wednesday.
"At last!," Mayor Steinar Bergsland swarmed at the start ceremony in TV2.
Some of the people who lived in the valley retreated their sunchairs and others put on sunglasses for safety purposes.
So far, sunhungry people had to go to a nearby summit with a cable car in the winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to direct the rays with mirrors into the valley.
This basic idea has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the City Council finally adopted the 5 million kroner (around EUR 615 000) expensive project.
A similar construction has been providing the Italian Alpine village of Viganella with winter sunshine for a few years.
Post barely learns on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed it yet, the red points for Sunday emptying are still on different mailboxes of the core city and the parts of the city, but you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you quickly find out that the emptiness on Sundays and public holidays is no longer taking place," the FDP reports.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays only in front of the post office building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and in Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld are emptied.
Whether to be emptied in Hofheim and Rosengarten on Sunday is not answered in the answer to the FDP's request.
The FDP's social and youth spokesperson, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to follow up on this.
The Sunday emptying is an important postal service right at the time post.
"Despite the increase in the price of letters on January 2013, this company is radically and indelibly looking at this."
Thomas Bittner, President of the Liberal Group and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), supports his group colleagues: "What annoys me is the fact that in this case the emptiness is changed or also deleted."
The post is a long way from being close to the public.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts of Neusloß and Rosengarten must be emptied again on Sunday," says Bittner and Rohrenbeck unisono.
The core city was also covered, especially not mobile citizens would have to be able to reach a letter box with Sunday emptying on foot.
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament if the city administration is planning talks with the post office on this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier answered that the mail did not communicate with Lampertheim.
But his knowledge also gave a Sunday lesson in Hofheim.
Your party has expressed its support for privatisation.
"Then decisions are made elsewhere," said Maier.
Frankfurt parking charges are expected to rise strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more sensitive.
The city's magistrate advises this morning about a presentation of the transport agent Stefan Majer (Green).
The car park charges are therefore to be increased by 50%.
However, it is not intended to increase the prices, but to reduce the time interval of parking and parking ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the City Council will then have to decide.
The retail committee of IHK Frankfurt considers this "not a good idea."
The possibility of parking immediately before the shop was "an ununderestimated advantage for smaller retailers."
The German transport club believes that an increase after two decades is "quite appropriate and, in fact, long overdue."
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Fast actions surprise hosts
With a narrow cadre, the gentlemen I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to compete in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen of the Swabian Alb.
The older were on the other side of the network with an experienced team.
But soon it became apparent that, even age-related, they could not fully support the rapid actions of the city of Freudenstadt.
With the hard and placed surcharges the Gönninger were extremely difficult.
They once again missed the passports and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz over the center of the network and were not in place in the block defense.
Two high first sentences clearly expressed the superiority of the cities of Freudenstadt in all matters.
In view of this overwhelming and game-determining performance, the third sentence was then won a little lax and lustlessly to the 3: 0 end (25: 13, 25: 14, 25: 22).
There will be a much more powerful opponent on the field on November 2 with the TV Baiersbronn, which was able to make itself clear in Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Büchle, Yannnik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räler, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt were in the Morgtal Hall in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and points, especially in the ball acceptance; even in the passports, the precision was sometimes lack of goods and in some critical games, the overzealous prevented the view for possible score gains.
In this very well-balanced encounter, however, the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto voted for the great physical commitment and a pleasant commitment of both teams.
Care day at the small English hut
A group of dedicated participants met at the small English hut in Ibach for the fifth day of care following the Natura 2000 project of the Upper Hotzenwald.
Based on suggestions from the population, this day in the area of the hut of view of the valley should be cut free, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, according to Kaiser, described this area as the highlight of the scaffolding on which the landscape offers the ideal framework for beautiful views.
He thanked the present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was an appropriate instrument to strengthen the relationship between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to make their own accents in nature.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, environmental considerations could also be taken into account.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait of the Department of Nature Protection of the Freiburg Government Prize following the welcome by Councillor Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wanted the action to be successful.
According to Tribukait, the tourist goal of the wide-view is to maintain the now highly grown old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and grasslands, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
They need these free links to the conservation of species.
Tribukait said she did not want to fail to break a lance for the planned biosphere at this point.
The current measure is not only seamless in this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity to achieve sustainable economic and environmental development based on internationally recognised unesco status and thus a continuous addition to the achievements achieved with the life project and the previous care days for the future.
According to these various statements, the district leader Christoph Wehle and the life-project manager Cornelia Bischoff assigned the helpers to groups.
The larger trees had already been beaten in advance, the forest towler may be ready to call.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of waxbar bushes and the maintenance of a dry stone bar.
The goal was the free view at the viewing point.
Löffingen: Kopfler still only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baarstadt Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, child, youth and senior policy, as well as its own city works can be called attractive city, no second mayor has yet been reported.
The only candidate for the succession of the mayor Norbert Brugger, who is no longer a candidate for age, is the 46-year-old bank manager and business manager Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen.
The application period will expire on Monday 11 November at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which has thousands of previous Nortel patents, launched on Thursday an avalanche of charges for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was overtaken by Nortel in the insolvency of Nortel.
Rockstar, the consortium that Nortel had bought for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent violations before the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is located in the joint ownership of Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused in seven cases of patent infringement.
The patents concerned technology that would bring search terms into line with relevant advertising on the Internet, according to the complaint, which is the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture mobile phones that work with Google's Android operating system, which is in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid of over 900 million dollars for Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and last offered $4.4 billion.
After being overdone with the Nortel patents of Rockstar, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also motivated by Motorola's library of patents.
"Although Google failed in its attempt to acquire the patent in the auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so," says the writing.
Rockstar calls for a high compensation from Google, as it claims that Google's patent infringement is intentional, according to the accusation.
Egypt Referees First freely elected Presidents
Muhammad Mursi is taking office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a "new Egypt," when he was the first elected president of the country to be sworn and thus the successor of Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months ago.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi became the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 judges dressed in black robes of the court, who have his seat on the Nile, and who are after an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are looking for a better future, a new Egypt and a second Republic," said Mursi at the ceremony that was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, a real democracy and stability," said the 60-year-old Mursi, an engineer trained in the US and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been in the forefront of the government since its foundation 84 years ago.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guards the building when Mursi arrived in a small car convoy just after 11: 00.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered before the court to cheer the new president, and, unlike the presidential run from the Mubarak period, traffic was only stopped for a short time so that the car convoy could cross the usually lively road that connects the city centre with the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic "replacement wheel" of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to bring the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said the Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with red tie, declared the judges in the wood-filled chamber in which he took power.
Mursi later went to the University of Cairo, where he was supposed to make his speech.
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel that played the national anthem, which he listened to in contempt.
The military leader of the field marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
On his arrival he was welcomed by hundreds of people present in the largest auditorium of the university with the chorus of "The army and the people are a hand."
The University of Cairo, which was founded as a bastion of secular education in 1908, has developed into an Islamic student group in the 1970s.
On Friday, Mursi took a symbolic oath on Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubaraks last year, and he praised to reclaim the presidential power that the military council had taken over from the head of state who was being driven out of office.
But by taking the official oath to the court and not to the Parliament as usual, he will bow to the will of the military, which indicates that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursis's speech on Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberger discothek "Blue Velvet" has started.
On Friday night it is called "Pump this party," on Saturday night tomorrow it will continue with an Ü 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are, of course, promised by the organizers on both days.
Workers fell by the ladder: severely injured
On Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell off a ladder and seriously injured himself.
The man from Lampwegshausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor on the outside of a guest house.
When he went up to the ladder on the roof, it slid away and the man fell to the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was brought to the country hospital in Salzburg with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6."
Rape in South Africa: two life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to two life sentences on Friday.
This was reported by SABC.
The victim had later died of the consequences of the serious injuries.
John Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The act had caused terror across the country.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in an industrial area in Bredasdorp near Cape Town in February.
14 hours the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The sight of the young people was so terrible that the carers and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted to being in a bar with Booysen during the trial.
He also confessed to having beaten and raped her, but he refused to be responsible for the girl's death.
The police had first taken on several perpetrators, but released two suspects from prison because the evidence against them was not enough.
The prosecution also stressed during the trial that it was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rapes in South Africa are almost part of everyday life: there are about 64 000 ads every year because of sexual violence.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people, it has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
The police and women's associations in South Africa, however, value the dark figures in sexual violence 10 to 25 times.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": For the TV show "Galileo" the Pro7-Star Bonndorf visited.
The speaker made it clear at the beginning: the most important thing for the ham is the pig's coals, and the turbomast is not a good condition.
Can ham you get in every supermarket be a quality product?
Uli as head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest explains Jumbo the operation of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favorite ham," as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and kittel he comes inside the factory.
Jumbo has to disinfect his hands before he can reach the micro.
Jumbo seen to strengthen at fast-growing in Waldshut
"There are huge quantities of work to be done here," the TV makers, Black Forest ham, are surprised as a mass product.
16,000 chills a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, color: Uli explains what quality is all about.
Most pigs are slaughtered at the age of six months.
Television with level?
Details such as the Ph value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph-value.
"I'm curious when you measure Roberto Blanco what happens then," says Jumbo cynically.
The level of private television in pure culture is presented here.
But watching is still worth watching.
The viewer sees that the disassembly of the coals is still a hand work.
For: Black-walled ham is traditionally found without bones in the shelf.
The secret of the ham is the mixture of spices with the salt.
Smoke tower and smoke fire remind Jumbo optically of a "submarine."
The trick: Tannenzweige here in smoke ensure the special taste of the Black Forest ham.
20 days in the smoke make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in the Jumbo," he announces the test feed.
"It's really delicious," says the conclusion of the TV star.
This will enable all parties involved to live.
You thought travel agencies belong to the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be resisting the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the whole year and expects record income from tourists in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now assumes a adjusted annual profit before taxes between 325 and 340 million dollars, compared to 305 to 315 million dollars in its previous forecast.
When the current targets are reached, this means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of 290.4 million dollars in the period 2011 / 12
As CEO Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre achieved eight percent profit in the first half of the year and recorded a strong start to the second half of the year, especially in the Australian and British private business.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable, and some of them are well on the way to record annual income before interest and taxes," he said.
These include Australia and Great Britain, which are typically one of our strongest results.
In Australia, the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year, which compared a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Similarly, it went well for the leisure business of Flight Centre in the UK, while business customers also spent less here.
The US business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so that a profit for the year as a whole is expected for the third consecutive year.
Flight Centre's shares rose by 3 cents yesterday to $38.20.
Schools are being stopped to a greater focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In future, students will have to treat at least one piece of Shakespeare, a novel of the 19th century, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The examination also includes "unseen texts" to encourage wider reading.
The combined course from English literature and language is abolished.
From 2015, students will have to take a separate GCSE exam for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish tomorrow the new curricula for English and mathematics - the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the audit supervisory authority, will announce a reorganisation of the GCSE structures, including a new system of designation and less course work.
In a speech in the summer, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is a "broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence," stressing that the GCSEs would become "more challenging, ambitious and stricter."
Studies show that in English schools less time is spent on mathematics - 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year - than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach on average 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the schedule of hours, the coalition circles say that the comprehensive math examination - combined with a greater weight of the subject in rankings - will probably encourage schools to take more hours.
The curriculum places more emphasis on "problems from the right life," including financial mathematics.
Beautiful animals and delicious cakes lure
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colour beats will present the roundabout performance show this weekend in the House of Citizens.
The reviews were made on Thursday
The local club W514 is once again organizing this large exhibition.
Breeders of the clubs in the district of Soest show here their best animals as well as young Wickeder Hobby holders their rabbits.
On Thursday, six judges made the assessment of the many rabbits and were able to award outstanding animals.
The visitors of the show are well informed as the assessment of all animals is appropriate to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition takes place on Saturday at 2.30 p.m.
For all visitors, the rabbit show is open on Saturday from 10 am and on Sunday from 10 am to 3.30 pm, which is followed by the award ceremony.
Guests are also invited to a Tombola and a delicious cafeteria.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Forum
The next Ecumenical Forum on Monday, October 21, in the New Museum of the Castle is about "To hell with hell - theological considerations about today's handling of the last things."
The reference is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Conference Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant church communities of Salem, the Salem Castle and the Kulturamte Bodensee district.
Johanna Rahner wants to look at the question of how people now classify the "last things" after death.
If people had known too much about it in the past centuries, and put it on those pictures of heaven and hell, "which still shape our ideas," the contemporary prophetic teaching of the hopes of completion would be characterized by a certain embarrassment or even a lack of speech.
"The greater hope has been driven out of proportion by religious criticism," says the speaker.
She has "provided us with so many questions that the exclamation marks seem to have come away from us."
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the crucial challenge remains the inconvenience of death."
The question of the desire, "which dreams that in the end everything will be good."
Johanna Rahner, born in Baden-Baden in 1962, studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her doctorate in 1997 as Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has a chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from the Little Heuberg reaffirm their faith in the affirmation
In two divine services 101 15 and 16-year-old young people of the Seelsorgeunit at the Little Heuberg have been flown.
In the morning the group Laudato-Si accompanied the service, in the afternoon the youth choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the Firmsakrament, the young people said yes to their baptism and demanded the power of the Holy Spirit.
The Firmlings have been preparing for the big day in the past months, under the direction of Diacon Reiner Dehner and the help of many members of the community.
In different projects they met various tasks of the Christian community level and shared the youth day in underpower.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race Enjoys participants
In the wonderful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to take the tour of the hills around the lake.
Ulrich Knobel of Illmensee is aware of this.
Among the participants, especially at the short distance over 15 km and 300 meters of altitude, were also numerous all-man racers who wanted to play their hobby once in a competitive atmosphere.
Two German top-class junior drivers were also at the start of this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aachen-Linz came with the recommendation good places at the German championships.
These two were expected to move from the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time to the target and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
With the ladies it was Theresa Duelli of the team nightmare that made it to the top of the winning stage.
In place two and three Anne Adel came from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen.
A pleasant development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the municipality.
Not only in terms of performance, the entire range of athletes was represented.
The age structure of ten years was also sufficient for the youngest to over 70 years for the oldest starters.
In the main race this year, even more absolute top athletes were at the start.
Four drivers were able to get away from the top regional drivers.
Among them Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike half-professional from the Black Tusk Racing team.
Pangerl, together with a team mate, was already twice the world champion in the 12-hour drive.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
With Roland Ballerstedt, who already calls two German championships in the Duathlon his own.
After 45 km and 900 meters of altitude, a Wimpernklagenfinale came in front of the three-lake hall.
Pangerl was the first to get over the finish line.
Only a second behind it was the routine Ballerstedt who was able to secure the second place in the overall score.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann were the third in the overall score.
In the women's election, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main race.
The second place was secured by Areane Blersch from Binwangen in front of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Sportlers and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized course of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Blou brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwave and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people

Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the "CNN Heroes of 2013."
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him as the "CNN Hero of the Year."
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father lose consciousness and travel to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Blou was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation, which spread to his brain and caused a hematoma that should affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years with his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," comments Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5: 00 in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and it's not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for 5,000 people each, according to the World Health Organisation.
On the other hand, the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for her, most camerunas could not afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three quarters of the country's health expenditure is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
To see his father and so many of his fellow countrymen suffer in Bwelle made the decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team carried out 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organisation called ASCOVIME, which travels on weekends in rural areas and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people forced themselves into small buses and went to the villages that need help with the severed medical equipment on the roof over unfixed terrain.
It's not always going smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be received as heroes: a feast, singing and dance, and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and wave - with its wide smile and its limitless energy - is happy to join the happy celebration.
The next morning, the team will start investigating hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip," says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometres around the village - and this is on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others get crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates - a document that is required for the school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
The operations usually take place in a school, city hall or apartment; after the procedure, the patients get up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next person.
The lighting for the surgery and the disinfectant is fed by the generator of the group, so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of the morning on Sunday.
It's a hard pensum, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
"They'll be drumming all night so we can stay awake and continue our work," says Blou.
On Sunday the team then goes back to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group - a mixture of Cameroon's doctors and foreign medical students - carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that with its work it makes a huge difference for the people to whom it helps.
A man explained that the free operation of a lesion that he had received now allowed him to work again.
"This changes the future of my family," said the man.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his non-profit activities, according to Bwelle; the rest come from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who is studying medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and is working in Bwell's group on a voluntary basis.
He's always in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the US and Europe and support the wave, this is an opportunity to gain practical experiences that they would never get at home.
"We can be involved in operations where we help to tap blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Blou," explains O'Malley.
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
The students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and bring often donated health care material.
But once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, the transport and the instructions.
"He is no doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the people of Cameroon knows no limits.
The almost constant work is not a burden for the wave.
To help others to live a happier life and to fulfil a promise he has given to his Father is a great joy to him.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," says Bwelle.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to ease the pain.

Excellent master of the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The Old Man and the Sea," is cut to the body by Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old rabbit in his metier, the acting art.
No one can blame the old man Santiago for fishing.
That's how the two of them are just great.
You almost think you can see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man the fishing boy Manolo is talking about.
If Santiago is tired of life on the chair, it's real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that is excellent for Janson.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and eventually wins the fight against the fish by his knowledge and strength of will.
Janson is on stage as a single actor in a wide range.
He manages to focus the audience's attention on himself, so that his monologues are not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the audience forget that the sea is only made of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann has the old man in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he puts the active scene in light: the hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings with her songs and her beautiful voice the sense of life of Cuba.
The four musicians play Kuba's rhythm and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: descent to the Romans
A drainage channel from the Roman era is maintained at about 120 meters in length below Cologne.
If you visit Cologne, you will not pass the cathedral.
The two towers are about 157 meters in the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors who admire the two filigree church towers know that there is also a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert on Cologne's underworld.
The service center of Cologne-Tourisme is a meeting place for its guided tours.
The tour begins unspectacular: "We start in the underground garage," says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a car-just city, and that is why the remains of the old city wall only stopped standing that was not too big.
Most of the users of the car park are therefore also running past the Roman remains today and only turn off their car.
But if you look more closely, you will find an archaeological site separated by metal grid bars in the park deck D2.
There are about five meters of high ruins of hand-sized stones.
"It is the remains of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century after Christ," says Schulze.
Before going back to the daylight, Schulze lets the participants on the upper park level take a look at a dark, 15-metre-deep shaft.
This is the well of the old cathedral, which is unfortunately hardly seen.
The next station of the tour is the pretory, and here the participants are back down to the depth.
We see here the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the precursor of the CCAA.
What CCAA means is a visitor.
"The abbreviation stands for" Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium, "which in good German means as much as" the city of Roman law and the city of Agrippineser, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the Kaiserkult. "
And the pretory is the former governor's palace, the center of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the front room of the exhibition leads a tunnel access to the Roman wastewater channel, which is preserved here at about 120 meters in length.
"You can walk along a piece of the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," cheers the guests.
There's another surprise to Schulze.
After he has taken the key at the checkout, he leads the group to a 16-metre-deep, walk-through shaft.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater that was essential for the ritual washing.
To date, different water levels can be read in the lower end of the mike, whose origins go back to the eighth century, by changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe is part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square, for which the construction work is to start shortly.
But until completion, a few years will be passed.
leg almost hacked off: new edition of rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker environment is rerolled after more than four years.
A trial for attempted manslaughter, dangerous assault and material damage to two 30-year-olds has started before the Landgericht Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants remained silent for the start.
They were supposed to have been active in the rock scene and then they were part of the Bandidos.
The Public Prosecutor's Office is accusing them of stabbing and hitting three men in a car in June 2009, together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt.
All the victims were seriously injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are supposed to have been part of the competing group of Hell's Angels.
One is said to have been a high-level member of Berlin.
It seems that a persecution hunt with several cars has gone ahead.
According to the charges, we were talking about rev fighting and a power demonstration.
The two defendants had been acquitted in a first trial at the beginning of 2012.
A lawyer at the time said that it was not possible to prove that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Bundesgerichtshof lifted the judgment after a review of the Public Prosecutor's Office and referred it back to the Landgericht for a further trial.
One of the defendants is currently in the open for another offence.
The start was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes during the night of the crime.
As a witness, the Commissioner at that time was invited.
The center was the phone calls of the defendants and other people who had heard from the police.
It is difficult that Rockers in court almost always comply with a law that is true for them - and not testify.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt Public Prosecutor's Office (Oder) said, on request, that new traces had emerged since the last trial.
11 more negotiating days have been set for the process.
The disposable company does not think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but at some point it goes home.
Only: In the bellies of the people in the passenger and back seat the hunger is noticeable.
Of course, one or another cocktail or champagne may be responsible for that!
What's closer than going to the next drive-in to get a little something?
I admit, I like to be with you when we get to fast food at night or early in the morning.
A few fries, a cola, a burger - and then no way back home and into bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco-gangs are noticeable.
For what must you miss, that with constant regularity you throw your fast food bags out of the car window?!
Especially on weekends there are discarded paper bags on street borders and on parking spaces.
"Why?" I wonder.
Are the people too deaf to take the bags home with them to the next trash bin?
It's not just that the paper stuff is ruining the landscape.
Sacks have already covered transport facilities such as guide boards and thus caused accidents.
But not thinking about that, she probably doesn't even know what this word actually means.
When you travel more often in the evening, just with several people in the car, you know what a backseat can look like after celebrated nights: clothes, bottles and other trash are coming.
There would be a few bags, more or less, but no, as opposed to the road, where no one wants to trample on the food remains of others.
I see already the day when the cities and communities will be too stupid to go - and the fast food chains will have to demand a pawn for their bags.
Obama's Retreat in Health Policy
After a lot of criticism, President Obama made a retreat yesterday in his often repeated, clear promise: "If you like your health insurance, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of people received a letter of resignation from their insurer, the Republicans have accused the President of cheating on the American public in the last few days.
Yesterday Obama relatified his original promise.
"The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep them," he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the redundancies, Obama called on those Americans who received such communications to look around the free market for a new insurance.
Most citizens could thus receive better, more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or cheaper than forecast.
"You're coming up with a better offer," he said.
The government said it was a little surprising that the five percent of the population who have themselves made an insurance policy had to look at another tariff, as their contract did not comply with the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I want to tell these Americans straight away: you deserve better," said Sebelius at a hearing in front of the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, stated that the launch of the online platform had been "miserable" since October.
"I'm as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I'm determined to regain your trust.
This statement by a sebelius, who was put up for a meeting in the House of Representatives yesterday, was taken up after a discussion with Republican Member Billy Long from Missouri, which was about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly asked why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily waived a state-funded insurance to conclude a tariff at HealthCare.gov itself, which she now wanted to sell millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian Air Force Base
An American government official who wanted to stay anonymous on Thursday said to the American news station CNN that Israeli aircraft had attacked an air force base in the Syrian Latakia one day before.
The aim was to have been "missiles and related equipment," which the Israeli government feared were intended for the Lebanese Hezbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as the Arab channel Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shot on the night from Wednesday to Thursday and that the Israelis were responsible for this.
The Israeli television station Channel 2 showed satellite images of the support point in Latakia, on which Russian S-125 Newa-type defence missiles and a battery of SA-3 missiles, according to Channel 2, have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport warheads up to 70 kilograms.
The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the news agency Reuters quotes a also anonymous Israeli government official, saying that he believes that Israel has carried out the attack, but is not sure.
One speaker from the Israeli Ministry of Defence said, "We do not comment on these reports."
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had tried to supply ground-to-air missiles to Hezbollah before, in part successfully.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons meant the crossing of a "red line" to which a military response would follow.
John Kerry explains in an unprecedented confession that the US espionage "went too far"
John Kerry, with an unexpected admission, suggested a shift in the US's defensive attitude to its surveillance programmes by saying that in certain cases the espionage "went too far."
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he, together with Barack Obama, was responsible for the "autopilot," when the explosive revelations of the Whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA's espionage activities became public.
Because of the leaked information, the US government has entered a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies.
In a video-related speech at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: "The President and I, and others in the government, have heard of some things that have almost been done by autopilot, simply because there was the ability to do what was left of the Second World War and of the difficult years of the Cold War and of course of the 11th September."
He was the first high-level member of the US government to admit that the US espionage had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said, "In some cases this has gone too far."
The President is determined to create clarity and therefore carries out a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that there is abuse here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people in this process are not affected.
However, Kerry insisted that the NSA was a power of good and that many lives had been saved through its surveillance operations.
He added: "We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is disdainful about killing people, blowing up and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people, because we have experienced such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to dispel the concerns about the alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with the US in the anti-terrorism efforts, as the President of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he had spoken to representatives of the European Parliament and other persons this week and was concerned about their threats to no longer participate in anti-terrorism organisations due to the National Security Agency's frustration of monitoring.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans remain on board in view of our joint efforts against terrorism," said Murphy, who, as a Democrat, is in the Senate for the first time and is working as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
I am also going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger through the NSA programmes.
Media reports, according to which the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe, have burdened relations with some US allies, although the Head of the Intelligence Service this week stated that the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations quoted from documents passed by Snowden, according to which the NSA had monitored the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of the national intelligence services, James Clapper, defended the espionage of allies as necessary and said that this was common on both sides.
In all this tumult Murphy said that his authority prepared the journey of the Congress, which is to take place this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact itinerary was still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some "serious words."
He said that European governments should be honest with their people about the type of spy programmes they used for years.
"Although we can change our monitoring programmes and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also be satisfied with the fact that we are not the only ones who spy," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is on a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to deal with the rumor about the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as the US surveillance activities.
A persistent injury to the jump joint threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga-Auswärtspiel of FSV Mainz 05 at the FC Augsburg.
Mainz is calling for a commitment from Nicolai Müller.
He'll try to train with the team tomorrow.
So far, he could only do this individually.
"We will decide on his commitment in the short term," said Trainer Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his six-shot best goalkeeper with him.
The Mainzer must already give up the injured power carriers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australians appeal against prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in Phuket prison because she had falsely claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver has appealed against the judgment and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15, when she told the Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours of Sunday, June 10, while two other men held her.
Later, however, the video footage of a video camera showed that she had safely arrived at her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend.
The Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to making up the story.
She was in police custody on the spot until the trial.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention facility on the outskirts of Phuket, instead of a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Ruggy League, who has addressed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunks explained to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about the well-being of his daughter and wanted her back in Australia.
"We are, of course, very concerned, but we hope that she will be home as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford has filed an appeal against the judgment and is against a bail of 50,000 Baht on the loose.
In Australian reports it was read that in the meantime she is taking a holiday in the resort of Krabi in South Thailand.
On the part of the court, Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that after the recent murder of the travel rau Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may be trying to improve its competitive tourist image and therefore there is an acquittal.
