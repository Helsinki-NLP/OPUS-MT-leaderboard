Mr Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic relations with the third largest economic nation in the world.
Plans for greater nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
According to reports, India is also hoping for a treaty on defence cooperation between the two nations.
Karratha Police arrested 20-year-olds after fast motorcycle hunting
A motorcycle was confiscated after the driver had taken it at 125 km / h in a 70 km / h zone and through Buschland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after they watched it leaving a gas station on the Bathdate Road at 125 km / h.
The police report that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued on Burgess Road before he turned off to the bushland where the officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle as well as a person who was in line with the driver's description were later seen at a house at the Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
The Karratha police are accusing a 20-year-old man of not respecting a stop signal as well as reckless driving.
It is to be published in the Official Court of Karratha on 23 September.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.
George Webster charged with hotel rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is in court for the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read in a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raping a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she was "unconscious, slept, and could not signal consent."
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim, Scotland, on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the negotiating date for 17 November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Returning to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have put forward a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade unions as civil law.
"As trade unions die, the middle-class jobs also die," said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota and Deputy Chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
So I am proud to present the employee authorisation law with the civil rights icon John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination in the event of the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and stops anti-union forces.
The addition of the national labour law law to create a possibility of discrimination for workers to organise a trade union representation in order to sue a civil court for justice - and to obtain compensation or penalty money - is a useful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill are proposing is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks the trade unions have been facing in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries throughout the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognise, extend and respect labour rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to association in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militarised car force Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full aware that workers and their trade unions have a role to play in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognised that "workers' rights to union and joint negotiations and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that the fascism of Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves and raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans introduced a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations in order to secure and improve the working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or business.
Agreements which restrict this right or aim to reduce it are null and void; measures aimed at it are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights, which designed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join trade unions for the protection of their interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When this country consulted other countries on how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans said that the right to the creation of a trade union - and that this union should then be allowed to participate in collective negotiations as an equivalent partner with companies and government agencies - should be protected.
After these rights were under attack in America, it is indeed very wise to see the American ideal again, which means that the working population must have the right to unite and to be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers' movement did not restrict the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the living standards of millions of people, work has wonderfully created a market for industry and raised the whole nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history keeps them.
History remembers, and so should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens' rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and redeem the promise of democracy.
Judge stops temporary law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close down
A US federal judge temporarily stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana on Sunday, which lawyers say that it would probably have led to the closure of all five government abortion clinics.
This measure, which was brought into the law by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana in June and is to enter into force on 1 September, would force doctors who carry out abortion to acquire a patient's right to receive a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that doctors can continue to carry out legal abortions for the time being while applying for such a right.
"The applicants can continue to work in accordance with the law, while they are seeking to obtain these rights," wrote Federal Judge John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within one month, a hearing shall be convened for the judge in order to bring about a more lasting decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a number of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors would have so much more time to obtain hospital recruitment rights.
"Today's decision means that the women in Louisiana are missing a devious law that they want to take their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, President and Chairman of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who had complained on behalf of three of the five state clinics to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also covered the doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the action and had also applied for the right of recruitment.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have adopted similar laws, with courts recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi non-constitutional.
The key points of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the hospitals in the state to close, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
The American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, agree that the right of recruitment of doctors requires unnecessary restrictions.
Adversaries stop the measures from being used to protect the health of women, although some also welcomed the effects of the closure of clinics.
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has the right of access to the patient, the Centre for Reproductive Rights.
If all the other doctors in the state were forced to stop doing abortion, this doctor would no longer perform the surgery for fear of his safety, the group said.
In their argument against the judgment, representatives of the state of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for the conduct of abortion, while their applications for the right of access to the patient were still pending.
Delayed diagnoses and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates due to ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have made a video homage online for her mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in the rural areas of Australia there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analysed the medical data of more than 1100 Australian patients who found ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 percent of five years after the diagnosis were still alive.
The research director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk during the study was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
KLEINE STUDIE: New medicines could slow down lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years of age.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, existing pre-diseases and social and economic status also affected the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer was already advanced at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk during the study was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city are more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan is suspected of a late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible factors for this.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are usually found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services to counter distances, she proposed, as a possible remedy, a strengthening of the service of inbound doctors in order to give specialists the opportunity to provide women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that, regardless of geographical status, the study showed a poor long-term survival rate for women in ovarian cancer and underlined the need for better treatment and precautionary strategies.
The study financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is now published in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Nave, a young mother of 33 years old, learned from the gold coast that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres regret declining house owners
The decline, together with an increased decrease in the number of house owners under 35, could lead to the loss of tens of thousands of pounds per year in garden centres if today's young consumers, following a study by the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times, reach the "core age group for garden products."
The report says that tenants spend on average 55 percent of the amount that people with their own home spend on their garden.
The increase in people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular process of asphalting the foregardens for parking purposes and the decline in garden size are other factors that threaten the industry in which an estimated 5 billion £is put into sale.
In the London area, where over a period of 6 years the share of house owners has fallen from 61 to 43%, the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that living for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot draw plants.
Guy Barter, head garden consultant for the RHS said: "Container gardeners are very popular, for example, with tenants, because they can take their plants with them on a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retail due to increasing home ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted this year an improved market situation due to better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the spiritual Tahirul Qadri, continues.
In the capital of Islamabad, about 1000 demonstrators have stormed the state television station PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings again.
The transmitter set up its operation for about 40 minutes, but is now sending it back.
At the same time, about 3000 demonstrators tried to get to the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About one kilometre away, they supplied themselves with sticks and stones equipped collisions with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The protesters called for Sharif's resignation, but he refused.
The country's army is therefore calling for a political solution to the conflict, "to waste time and to apply it without violence."
After a meeting in the headquarters on Sunday night, the military announced: "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already been pushing more often.
The opposition politician Imran Khan is accusing Prime Minister Sharif of cheating on the parliamentary election last May.
The protests were escalated on the weekend after Khan and Qadri had called their supporters to advance to Sharif's residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey is ordering US diplomat for espionage report
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered the country's oldest US diplomats to provide information on a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the US Embassy and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former US analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a major activity for the US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all the important countries were spying on each other.
A previous report, which was also the focus of Germany's most important secret service, provided a much more angry response from the Turkish government.
Warning strike: Lokführer threaten with consequences for Pendler
The nationwide warning strike of the local leaders on Monday night could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The general public will be informed of the progress made in the field of all transport companies, including long-distance, regional and S-Bahn transport,
The main direction of the warning strike is the transport of goods.

said the district chairman of the German Locomotivführer (GDL) trade union, Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
There are no regional priorities.
The main thrust of the warning strike was the transport of goods.
The Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do anything to keep the effects as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it was difficult to predict the consequences.
Police Chief of Magaluf charged with corruption
On Friday, the prosecutors presented evidence of blackmail by police officers and staff of the city of Calvià to the office of the State Prosecutor of Mallorca.
The chief of the Calvià police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after allegations of corruption by businessmen and cash owners in the notorious Binge drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was arrested by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of blackmail by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià to the Office of the State's Anti-Corruption Office on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption allegations and are questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that the angry night club owners said that the government's power management had a serious impact on their business.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about survival," one of the businessmen told the court.
Let our base of life out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
This summer, Magaluf made international headlines on the basis of a viral YouTube video, showing an 18-year-old British tourist who took part in 24 men on a fun tour of Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the irregular behaviour of alcoholic vacationers in Magaluf by minimising the number of participants in the notorious alcoholic pub tours.
The Playhouse Club, in which the Fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the Kneipentour organiser Carnage have to pay a penalty of €55,000 ($73,000) together.
The tourist town of Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British tourists, is also known for a number of accidents under alcohol influence, including the trend of "Balconing," where people jump from one balcony to the other or from a balcony into the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The FRÜHLING has provided a winter surprise to South Australia, with heavy swings and strong wind that affected flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 9 pm, another 5mm of rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already gone down that night to Sunday.
The last rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a cast that started just before 8 pm and caused almost 4mm of precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week had provided an early dose of spring, the temperatures in the city fell again on Monday to a maximum of only 15.8 ° C.
The bad weather conditions have probably led to the late landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7.30 p.m. but was hit by a sharp wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to pass through.
At this time, wind currents reached about 50 km / h at the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the plane had to pass through a second landing and finally started at about 8.40.
The delay led to the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16 ° C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies means: Highest time to network
In view of the galloping technical progress that threatens to turn our comfortable home into high-tech control centres, our columnist Bernd Matthies is comforting with a highly familiar electronic accessories.
As I write this, my look at the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think, Boah, how retro is that?
But there is a thought behind it: If the cable were not, all the listeners would fly around in the house in the shortest time, and that would be even more retro.
This is true of the eceltronic (eceltronic)?
No, typos: electronic) sector the rule that today's new world is the electric scrap of tomorrow is bought - outdated.
And who, for example, still has a tube TV in the living room today, is simply saying that he is fundamentally opposed to television.
Why are these considerations?
Because the pressure of the Ifa on the funkturm this week is again showing us our absolute incompetence in electronics issues.
The layman, who used to be blind to the washing machine and CD player, does not even understand today the purpose of the devices that are being spread out in front of him with incomprehensively vain expert speech: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies," the press office promises us.
Yeah, you all right?
What are you supposed to talk about with people who seem to spread this kind of quark on their own?
In fact, it has been about 20 years, above all, that we have been supposed to network our house.
So that the yogurt himself will be ordered, so that the fire detector will tell us on vacation on the Maldives that it is burning in the study.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we were from the office to the air conditioning on our arrival...?
Yes, but that requires an air conditioning.
But a dream is definitely coming true soon: we lift our wristwatch, you say, "Suction!" - and at home the vacuum butter goes off.
Crazy.
Everything goes to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are blurring," a branch expert runs, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steamguard sends the weather report and the data glasses show how long the pizza in the oven still needs, but that's not useful because we are in the congestion.
We also know from the daily practice that when a new device is really needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
What is another reason why the spiral cable on the phone will survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to the schools on Monday, after they had spent the summer in the airspace, while rocket and mortar fire on their communities went down during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza were closed, while the area recovered from the fighting.
The start of the school brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities in the south of Israel, drawn by rocket gunholes, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed from the walls and sliding walls before the students arrived.
"We're a little scared, but we're excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident in the Kibbutz Saad and a local English teacher.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt a little weird to go back to school.
"These were difficult times, and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a cease-fire last week, thousands of residents of the border communities, such as Saad, stayed in their homes or left their homes to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a municipality near the border with Gaza, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, are still hesitant to return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Your children were temporarily accommodated in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town in Gaza, which is heavily marked by the Palestinian fire.
He called on the children to learn a lot and said, "We will ensure that you acquire knowledge and offer you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire provided an immediate end to the fighting, but important problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas's call for the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza to be lifted and the re-opening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the disarmament of Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to start in Egypt this month.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children were estimated by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies this information and estimates that at least half of the people killed are fighters, but did not provide any concrete evidence of this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 missiles and mortar grenades during the fighting on Israeli cities, most of them in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelter and continue fighting, the education authorities have postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will be open again soon so that we can continue to learn, just like the children of the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
By choice in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl questions NPD ban procedures
In view of the losses of the NPD in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl has declared itself in favour of an end to the ongoing NPD ban procedure before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the NPD should be brought to an end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD cuts off worse than the last time," said Strobl, who is also CDU head of state in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipzig People's newspaper."
This is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that makes me more likely to come to the conclusion that the NPD is to be fought politically rather than before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had just failed in the vote on Sunday at the five-percent hurdle.
A first start to a ban on the right-wing extreme party had failed in 2003, because constitutional protection also had informants in the NPD top at that time.
In December 2013, after a long preparation, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: tents for new refugees
At New Zealand Square, refugees are now housed in tents.
The central first reception for refugees in Harburg is from all seams.
Now the Interior Office has set up three tents of the Red Cross next to it.
The district politicians were informed just before - they are little enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions continue to raise citizens' concerns and give the district politicians no opportunity to participate constructively in the human housing of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, Group Chairman of the Greens in the Harburg District Assembly.
Your party demands that the Harburg district administration currently provide unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reason for the overfilling in the initial reception is the rush of aid seekers - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
The house prices have experienced the strongest winter increase in seven years, showing a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for home homes in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 percent in August, according to the RP data from Monday.
As a result of this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2%, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly spread across the country.
The research director of RP Data, Tim Lawless, announced that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-part market.
The figures of RP Data show that house prices in Sydney increased by 16.1% last year, while in Melbourne by 11.7%.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was hit hard by the cuts in government expenditure and where prices increased by only 1.4% over the year.
Mr Lawless further said that with the start of the spring, an increase in the real estate to be sold would now be observed for the next few months, which would be "a real test."
"When you look at the constantly high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the constantly low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will continue to rise in the next three months," he said.
In an opinion to the New Press he contradicts statements by the director Peer Medau and attest to him "as a field lord."
This is not the style of the university, it is stated in the communication.
The Medau family had already been informed orally about the school's intention in mid-June.
The statement that the plans were only announced in July is definitely wrong, "Pötl said.
At the same time, he pointed out that the plans were not "previews or even decisions," but that they were "preferences."
The extension of the narrow road up to the castle is also less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
There was no talk of a nine-metre-wide road.
The current level is 5.50 meters, which is one metre wider than before, "explains Pötl.
The Medau operators' argument that their free and school-based parking areas will be used by students of the university in the future will not allow Pötl to apply.
There is no parking at all because this can now be solved intelligently as with other public parking.
Think of the residents
According to the President of the University, the children's crib, which is located on the site and would lead the way to the park deck in front of its front door, should not be "affected."
Rather, he points out that "this is not just about the children's crib, but also about the residents at the mouth of the Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 students of the neighbouring real school.
So it is much more than a question of the special interests of Mr Medau, "Pötl said.
Whether the criticism of the parental council of the children's crib, with the development of the road would be "one of the few natural spots of Coburgs lost" is justified, "the reader can decide for himself."
At the beginning of October, Pötl, together with the Bamberg State Bauamt, will inform the city councils about the building development of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new development."
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the children's crib about the university's plans last week.
The access to the new park deck should therefore not be via the campus and the Friedrich-Streib-Straße as before, but through the Medau-Berg.
This means that the narrow road would have to be extended to about one kilometre in length two-track.
According to the Medaus's calculations, traffic in the Hohenfels Castle park would be ten times as much.
About 2000 vehicles a day are spoken of.
From the side of the city there was no wish to comment on the project.
Glanddorf retired from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old of the Bundesligiste SG Flensburg-Handewitt mainly led to health problems for this decision.
I have not made the decision easy, it has matured for several months.
It is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and end my career in the national team, "the 2007 World Champion announced on his Facebook page.
He is therefore going to international retirement with a record of 167 national games and 576 goals for Germany.
Because the huge backroom player for the Champions League winner from Flensburg wants to go on Torejagd for a few years, he is now no longer available to the new Federal trainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelandic, who announced his framework for the country games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf had a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have inspired me as much as they will inspire my many years of fellow players and my successors.
But for my club I would also like to be available healthy in the coming years, for which there is a need for longer regeneration breaks, which do not allow the current double load.
The left-hand had to fear his career end in 2012 after a ferren infection.
Because of Achilles' problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisone syringe that had later caused a strong inflammation.
An emergency operation and two further procedures followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the discussion ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career do not pass any body without a trace.
I have some health sites that I can't ignore anymore.
After the three infection-related foot operations that took place in 2012 at short intervals, I never really got my blood pressure under control.
In addition, there are some other wear-related complaints.
At the beginning of the year I noticed that I can control my head, but I can't fool my body, "in the interview Glandorf explained to the magazine" Handball Time. "
For a comeback he would only be available in an absolute emergency.
"When all the strings are torn, I am always ready to talk," the two-time family father explained to the specialist magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long stay in the hospital in 2012, I have become rather humble as far as my health is concerned.
After my career, at least I want to be able to go straight.
In addition to the 2007 World Cup and the 2014 Champions League, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012 he also secured the European Cup of the Cup winners with Flensburg.
German economy is shrinking by 0.2 percent in spring
The crises around the world have slowed down the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell by 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was reported by the Federal Statistical Office and thus confirmed preliminary calculations.
In the spring, the economy was the only one in consumption, while the investment fell.
External trade also slowed down the economic cycle.
Thanks to the strong start of the year, a total GDP increase of 0.8 percent is achieved for the first half of 2013 compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the "Münsterland-Mooiste," which first led through the Burgmannsstadt on Sunday.
The Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "biker" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organised the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste."
This was the largest cycle tour across the Münsterland, the cyclist paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Joter Huerne for the organisation of this tour through the Münsterland.
This tour has been offered to interested parties in various specialist journals.
We come from The Helder and have gone overnight to take part in this tour.
We would also like to get to know the Münsterland in this way, "the cyclists enjoyed the route through the circles of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After the registration at the Vereinsheim der Schützenbroderschaft Stat.
Katharina went on a small "peace trip" through the city over the wall, where the start was also made.
The route, which was written for three different categories, led in the direction of Herrenholz over the Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld and over Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On the 95 km route with 1175 meters of altitude, 120 kilometers with 1475 meters of altitude and 145 kilometers with 1775 meters of altitude, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were kept on their way to Havoxbeck and Billerbeck.
The main organiser Jos ter Huerne and mayor's representative Heinz Lölfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all involved.
The organization was without problems and there were no negative events, "Heinz Lölfing draws a positive conclusion to this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants came as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We will see each other again in 2015 in hopefully beautiful weather on August 30 or during another weekend," but the cyclists still promised to come back to the country of Münster and the organizers are planning a new edition.
Konstantin Weckers mercilessly honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Constantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, policy-proof activist, ex-prisoner, has brought to paper on 287 pages in "monk and warrior."
Not chronologically, but more thought flaws for thought flaws, the Münchner, born on 1 June 1947, wrote down his memoirs, each chapter initiated by a matching song text.
And he is unrelentlessly honest: from the onanie as a high school student to the shop theft and drug use he does not leave any human weakness.
Also to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Wide space also take on abstract, but all the more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all of this he tries to go to the bottom, in a very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also how he has not only shaped the music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter has also brought the Lebemann Constantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who is "created by subtraction," as he says, "by leaving away everything unnecessary."
But there are also short anecdotes to the earth between all the highly spiritual views: about the clashes in a GIs-frequented local or a crazy car ride, where he was looking at a tree in front.
He's honest there, too.
Lenny Henry: My father never took my arm.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry is testing for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was produced from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thinking about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, just stopped his voice: "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to see Cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already an adult when I was a child - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Most of my life, he was this serious guy in the corner reading the paper.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father, he still gained an insight into how life might have been for him.
It's a little brighter now, but they're dark, smothered, deep stygic maze with flaming and smoke and a lot of soot.
My father used to just lie down in the tub and then you could hear him slowly sing because he could wash the foundry of himself.
When I was walking around, I realized that he had done this for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him got bigger.
However, Henry grew up as a child without his parents' love testimonies.
My father never embraced me, he never said, "I love you."
Only when my mother was bad at the end of her life did we start saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop the "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn's a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I got very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You must be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exhausting.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career change may be in his elegant, short-cut bar.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he has been taken by the theatre.
It followed The comedy of misconduct, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedians who have completed his busy working life.
He started at only 16 years old when he worked at a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-1970s. "I was the only black imitator / comedian on television for a very long time."
He learned in the profession.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, but I also learned from 1975 to 1985 how to become an efficient joke-telling machine, while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the stage right on the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program where people "painted black," Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don't regret doing it.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on huge projects and learned how to deal with a big audience.
But this "years of award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
By introducing figures that both mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the eighties.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show was released in 1984, and in the nineties he was known among other things as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
Advertising, documentary films, TV series and film roles marked his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008, he thought, "What are you doing next, Len, because it all feels like you're just taking the time or stepping around a little bit."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 entitled What's So Great About...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was quite allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him at school and thought he was mostly a middle-class domain, white in pantyhose and a cabbage head in the front.
So I was really scared of it.
All those we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don't make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take some of the words in your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry performed 20 lines of Othlos's last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.
I felt like I could do this.
It was almost like someone finally put my head on.
"That's what it's about, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, research a little bit.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be expecting a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of error.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre and I couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical mistake, and Henry felt instinctively that he had to talk to the audience.
"A little voice told me," You have to bridge over for 10 minutes while they fix the computer. "
Instead, the stage leader announced that the idea would go on as soon as the problem was solved.
I went off the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was demanding.
Panic is very good, that strengthens the tendons.
This also came well, so it is like a great shield of the gods who say to me, "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a THUNDER voice.
So I'm gonna stay with you.
I really love this.
I love being in a sample room.
Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation has been through with humorous eruptions as he imitates people over and over again.
I've decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I think this kind of immediate satisfaction from a room full of strangers is kind of dangerous.
If you're always looking for that, you drive it in front of a wall.
I sometimes play live in the Apollo when I feel like it, but I don't have as much as I used to.
I'm asking him if he's ever gonna do a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director that helps to form a beginning, a middle part and the end of a journey - I don't think I ever want to give up again.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Hathi rebels block streets in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between Shiite Hathi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Hathis have called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa.
Hathi supporters would have occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, said a spokesman of the Hathi party "Ansar God."
The access to Parliament was also blocked.
Yemeni media report a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the "Yemen Post" newspaper, Hathi-Führer Abdulmalik al-Hathi had called on the measures on Sunday night.
According to the paper, Hathi threatened to further escalation of the conflict if his demands were not met.
The Shiite Hathis are fighting for more independence from the Sunni-controlled Yemen and calling for the government to resign.
The Hathi people's tribe has been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the main access routes of Sanaa.
In the surrounding area there are always bloody fights with the Yemeni army.
Kenya records officials to contain "spirit workers"
Kenya has started to register all state officials biometric in order to delete "spirit workers" from the government's payroll.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, said a government announcement.
The government suspects that thousands of people will still receive salary payments even after they leave the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service in 2013.
A review at the beginning of this year found that at least $1 million (£700,000) per month were lost in payments for "spirit workers" and through other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person has died or left the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC from Nairobi.
All officials now have to appear at identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are recorded, has been reported in a government message.
All those who did not do so without a credible apology would be removed from the salary list, the communication continued.
"This approach will make a significant contribution to the rationalisation of the public service by establishing the actual number of officials and by adjusting the list of salaries at both levels of government - so the" spirit workers "are eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the Cabinet Secretary at the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal of the art consultant Helge Achenbach will be negotiated for the first time in court on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, claim damages from Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings in a civil trial at the Düsseldorf Landgericht.
That's what a lawyer told me on Monday.
In the application, it is stated that Achenbach cheated on the purchase of works of art and old-fashioned cars and that Berthold Albrecht calculated higher than actually paid purchase prices.
As a result, the agreed commission was also higher.
Achenbach bought value items for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He was in the school service for 44 years, 23 of which was the head of the school.
From this time Manfred Richter knows many stoned Petershausen and Kollbacher from their time as a student.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always carried by his desire to see man in the student.
The snow-head is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his home country.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau / Nordbohmen, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he was already interested in the teacher's profession after four years of high school.
A year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
The family had to leave their house within half an hour.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight car.
That's how it got judges to the Upper Franconian village of Senkendorf.
The teacher education took place in Bamberg.
In addition, Manfred Richter had to walk six times a week to the next train station, take the train to Bamberg, go three kilometers across the city to school and back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter was given a sleeping opportunity in a red-cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 students in a dormitory.
In 1951, he took the first state exam and in 1954, after three years of teaching, he took the second state exam.
Since Oberfranken had no free teacher for him, he moved to Oberbayern and came to school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The "Miss Room" was his first "service apartment" in the school house.
In 1958 he moved to the newly built teacher's house next to the school in a three-room service apartment.
This house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school was dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the Petershausen-Kollbach School Association and in Petershausen five.
From the school year 1968 / 69 these were combined in Petershausen in today's city hall.
When the Indersdorf School Association was founded, only the primary school remained in the place.
In order to avoid a disqualification in the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl changed to Karlsruhe - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, so the children and their teachers were able to take up today's construction from September 1982, which was extended in 1997 after Judge's retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who had a workshop built at local cost and in the 1997 enlargement basement rooms, although this was not eligible under the school building guidelines.
"Mayor Götz was very school-friendly," said Judge.
Throughout his career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative who had responded to a school council on justice and justice: "You must never forget love." Manfred Richter put what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two things: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old man today.
And he had to know, "This is not always possible." Whether he only means his students or his own six children, it is not quite clear.
In any case, judge's actions were sometimes unconventional.
When students were fighting, they didn't get a criminal job from him and were not forcibly forced to sit down.
At the expense of the municipality, Richter had two pairs of boxing gloves bought and the two opponents had to compete against each other, even if there was a little vibe.
For the good of the school, the judge, as a rector, maintained a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This led the partisan judge, after his retirement, to apply at least as the last one on the CSU list for the municipal council in 1996.
But the judge was elected to number six and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten stop stops
If cyclists take a rest on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Scots, that is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, the only impression was the number of rest: the 700 participants of the hr4 bike tour and the accompanying tross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party in the open sky in the Scottish Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Cycling and celebrating on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig," the participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and attended a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it got serious: the cyclists took the first stage, the 60 km over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Scots.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes of Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started with the bike in Bad Vilbel, and the head of the private company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring, were welcomed.
For the refreshment of the body and the mind, all kinds of good things had been prepared: the land women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, twine, sprinkle and cheese cakes, which were wonderful for the competent cyclists.
"Such cakes can only bake women," a participant from Aulendiebach praised, while he ordered another piece.
At the drinking stand of the Geiß-Nidda gymnasium, cold refreshments could be obtained.
The "Duo Bravo" maintained the visitors with well-known melodies from operas and musicals, and gained enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park was relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He has earned it, after all he has already refixed the bicycle chains he has already jumped off."
The mayor and the manager still had to work: they were interviewed at the well in front of the drinking house of Reporter Rainer Janke and took the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
In 2004, he was the first to be a tour manager, and he had a lot to do with the technology on the ground.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated with his employees and the 15-head motorcycle staff of the police Hessen, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"Most of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from Giessen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus, and even from many cities in Westfalen, cyclists have arrived.
The number of participants depends a little on the available accommodation capacity.
In category I, the participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective accommodation.
From the spa, the cyclists had a good impression when they left after an hour and a half: "Bye!"
"It was beautiful in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved to say good-bye.
After the arrival in Scots, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were required in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and City Marketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful festival ambience and, of course, had been prepared treats, such as flaming cakes with well-cooled spring white.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his role as board member of the ADAC Hessen-Thuringia welcomed the visitors.
The three were visibly pleased with the "many operations in Scots."
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity to move in the open sky was used zealously despite the sporting activity on the bike.
The guests were increasingly mixed with citizens who were just as affected by the good mood as the great group of cyclists.
The second day for the cyclists, the stations Birstein, Wachtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the trenkwalders - were on the program.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of Radelns, the athletes met again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey due to the suspicion of "conspiracy against the government," reporting local media agencies.
The police authorities did not comment directly.
Among the prisoners are 14 high-level police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government staff, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested because they allegedly set up an organised criminal association and set up phone numbers.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described their actions as part of the activities led by the Islamic spiritual Fethulla Güllen against him and other persons in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools opened almost everywhere in Ukraine on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told journalists that not all schools had reopened, but he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people's front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, head of school in Slavjansk, who visited Jazenjuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace here and that the children will receive a education that will be useful to them in the future.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving their teachers flowers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It meets with a proud team of glory from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory Party.
And she's got her own front experience.
Her career began with the global management consulting company Bain and Co., where she joined Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the parent company Pearson's senior position went to a younger male colleague.
It is said that their settlement was almost £1 million.
Their political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended by Lord Browne, the former president of BP, to David Cameron when he was looking for more private knowledge in Whitehall: she became a consultant to the Cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory Councillor.
As early as May, I described the president's task with a poisoned cup.
Not only is the BBC a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: inside the first guard of its own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outside as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This ensures an almost unsustainable duopol, which calls for a complete comprehensive reform.
But what new president would risk starting, hitting on everything and taking away an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he might be killing himself.
It's a difficult task.
And as if that wasn't enough, many are still interested in seeing the BBC reduced - power, money and status overtaken.
While competition is getting closer and new technologies are threatening old, comfortable security, the forthcoming negotiation of the fees for the BBC is a matter of particular danger.
For the modest sum of £145.50 per year, the British public is buying into the world's most certainly largest media company.
The BBC is telling a good story: it says that it reaches 96 percent of all households and each of them costs only 40 pence a day.
And apparently, on the popularity scale, the BBC is rising again: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The vision and use habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines on my phone today and see missed programs on my iPlayer later.
But it remains a very beloved and significant institution.
She needs a significant chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that reducing tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official user account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a decreasing comment on the democratic district attorney, who is at the centre of a criminal charge against him for abuse of the authority.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another one by Perry's user account, which disbanded the previous one.
A tweet has just been sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
"I do not approve of the tweet and have deleted it," it was said in the later news.
Perry staff did not reply immediately to comments.
Although the tweets of Perry's official user account went out, it was not clear who actually served the feed.
In the former tweet, an unfavorable picture was drawn by the District State Attorney of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of being drunk in April 2013.
Perry made a veto against financial support from her office when she refused to resign, leading to an indictment against Perry - who might be a presidential candidate in 2016 - before a Grand Jury in Austin this month.
The text of the tweets is, "I don't always drive drunk with the three times the permitted alcohol level... but if I do, I'll sue Governor Perry when he splits it out."
I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not in charge of the investigation of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the charge a political trick.
His high-class team of legal advisers asked the judge responsible for the case to reject the charge and argued that the law that is being used against the oldest governor in the history of the State of Texas is indisputable diffuse.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of government money to the State Public Integrity Unit, which is based in Travis County, and in cases of state corruption in Texas, when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto made a public complaint from a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After he had completed his fifth election in Iowa during his presidential candidacy in 2012, Perry began to think of speculation that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself in the jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we are coming!"
Berkeley restates housing market for "normal"
One of the most prominent construction companies in London pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England had returned to normal levels.
Home homes in the capital were highly sought after and the subject of huge price increases, which led the Bank of England to set ceilings for mortgage loans in June due to the widespread fear of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-class construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal trading levels since the highest level of 2013," and added that this provides a "stable environment of action."
The real estate market in London was well established during the downturn, as foreign buyers moved to the capital.
According to the Catholic Office, prices in the city area alone increased by 18.5% last year, much more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
The average sales prices for Berkeley's private, cost-effective and student offers increased by about one-fifth in the past year and were at the end of April by £423,000.
However, a stronger pound has made property property in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been discouraged by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric by a possible "death tax" before the general elections in May.
The London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the Mortgage Market Report for April, which presented sharper lending schemes, would also lead to lower market growth in the second half of the year, both in terms of real estate sales and prices.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday show a decrease in the mortgage authorisation in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling down.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the rise in real estate prices in London in 2015 to 3 percent, based on already weakening house price awareness.
The volume of transactions in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has now decreased by a quarter year after year, according to the broker WA Ellis.
However, the desire for a home in the capital for Berkeley is a blessing, as the amounts due for the sale of time are more than £2.2 billion.
Mr Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result, time sales have remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost a third more than the highest level in 2007 before the crisis.
The annual pre-tax result increased by 40 percent per year to £280 million, and sales by 18 percent to £1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday before the company's annual meeting, Mr Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley is expected to be in line with current market expectations in the current year.
The analysts estimated the annual pre-tax result at £450 million in accordance.
Berkeley shares were fixed in London's trade in the afternoon at £23.96.
Nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence published by Hacker on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence's performance at the 85th Oscar Ceremony.
Nude photos of the Oscar Prize winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of pictures of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and accused the hacker of "blatant violation of privacy."
The authorities have been notified and will follow all those who post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos that were originally posted on the photo-sharing page 4chan were allegedly obtained by a gap in the iCloud online storage system from Apple. The alleged "master list" of the hacking victim includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It is not certain how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I took years ago in the private environment of our house - I hope you are really happy with you," wrote Winstead on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the "iCarly" and "Victorious" Nicolodeonserien, however, argued that the photos about pictures of her acted and tweeted "These so-called naked pictures of me are FEEL, people.
Let's go back to the beginning. * Word game intended *.
Buzzfeed reported on late Sunday that a speaker of the pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos from her.
Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's highly praised new novel about love and the letter "J."
The best way to describe it was to break them down, they were slowly dissolving like a box that was left in the rain.
Sometimes a woman told him he was too serious, hard, intense, distant and perhaps a little scratchy.
And then shook his hand.
He knew scratchless.
He was stingy, like in hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this intoxication was a just beginning affair that had been more promising for a relief of the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomon was a trembling tender beauty with untamed hair and a flaming heart from a village on the North Island, which was even more remote and rusty than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older companion who thought Kevern was her aunt, and who had inherited a property in a moist but paradisian valley with the striking name Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaking, in the bathrooms were still spiders, naked cheeks had left their tracks on all the windows and believed that all of this belonged to them, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like huge cabbage heads.
It was like the house of a children's fairy tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" stands on the Longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had sat with Ailinn holding hands on the broken loungers in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had sounded mentally absent into the service console that provided the country with soothing music and gentle news when the sight of her crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song by a long-forgotten black entertainer, whom his father had liked to listen to at closed shutters in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was really forbidden - just not played.
It has been successfully observed, just as the word has been observed.
The general taste created what was left and what rules had never been made, and how people in books choose the from-counter-to-millionaire memoirs, cookbooks and love novels, they chose the ballads at the music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing big feet in a coarse-funny serenade of Ailinns.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"This was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fat Waller," he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done that to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it'll cost you a penny.
It had not been a very funny game at that time, and it was not very funny now either.
He knew this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard any.
Jazz was not played, even if he was not directly forbidden.
The improvisation was no longer modern.
There was only room for one "if" in life.
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
So is the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressed mind.
Although he had become 10 years old without hearing from Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz about his father's half-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fat's Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singers were not black.
Again, no laws or constraints.
A consistent society meant that each element of this society was grateful to the principle of group gifted - grateful as those spared by fate.
People of African-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports through temperament and body construction, so they sang and ran.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent as by nature and were responsible for ensuring that no family was left without a functioning service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewerage; what was left of the Greeks broke plates.
Those of the Gulf States and the Levant, whose grandparents had not quickly left the country as WAS WEDEN, when WEDEN IT WEDNES- were to be charged with fire, even for fear that the flames would eat them next - had opened Labne- and Shisha-Pfeifen-restaurants, kept in mind and were depressed with the inactivity.
Everyone according to their abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung to her could ever be printed.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really insulting," said Kevern.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved that song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge cabbage-like leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father have loved something like that?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but hesitated to put two fingers on her lips again in her presence.
She thought he was a little weird anyway.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head of disbelief and blocked Kevern's vision.
There was nothing to see all over the world but her uncombed raven black hair.
There was nothing else he would have wanted to see.
"If you say it," they mean without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't that direct.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your thick ankles are exactly why I like you," he tried instead.
I'm a little perverted.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often put himself in trouble because, like his father, he did not have the soothing charm that one needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel, too.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern.
Despite his kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomon became red and rose out of her chair, threw the console around and spilled the wine they had been drinking.
Holunderflower wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excitement she seemed to be trembling, like palm wedge in the storm.
"And your fat head is exactly why I feel perverted to you," she said...
Except that I'm not.
She was sorry for both the unnecessary unfriendliness of his words and the fear that was shown in her eyes when she turned on him.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She had not told him about the life on the cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke here as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more sad than their ancestors had been as smugglers and beach predators, moved from pub to pub, always ready to raise their hand against a woman who refused or abandoned them.
Big-headed?
They would have shown her a big fist if she didn't watch out!
They first snuff - knuff was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, a antidote to the unsaying love ballads from the console - just snuff them and then hit them.
According to Kevern, this was an unnecessary refinement, as the Knutschen itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomon gave him a sign to walk through her body.
He rose up from the rectory like an old man.
She felt like she was staying, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
That wasn't the end of the world.
You barely knew each other.
She watched him get away - just as she saw her companion in a room on the upper floor - a man complaining about something he himself had sworn on.
Adam's leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised her hands against her.
A man turned away from her, bent his back, ashamed, defeated, without a spirit of struggle - why was that a sight she seemed to know well, if she could not remember a single time she had seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomon looked at her feet.
Some years before the events that have just been told, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative public-mood monitoring body, worked on a short talk about the continued violence at a low and medium level in exactly the parts of the country where their reduction, if not abolition, is most likely to be expected, given the money and energy invested in the eradication of this violence.
"A lot has already been done, and much still needs to be done," she wrote, "in order to harden the innate aggressiveness of a people who have led a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country where the sweet breath of human kindness has been rarely felt historically despite the high-rise church towers between the hedges.
But some properties turn out to be inexhaustible.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less the passion it continues to awaken.
The population weeps in listening to sentimental ballads, intoxicates stories of overcome difficulties and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only does the former robustness hold the rural communities in hand as well as our urban structures, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and depressing dispute at home, at work, on the streets and even on the fields of play.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," said their mentor, when he had read the whole report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Once again, Esme relied on her right to privacy and refusal of the statement.
Feminist?
Shut up again.
"I do not ask," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I would be against atheism, lesbacy or feminism.
This is a non-prejudicial job.
We serve a non-prejudice society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which in itself are absolutely acceptable and commendable, may sometimes distort results, as you have presented them.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things, which you call "submissive" and "raw," could be interpreted by others as an expression of natural power and vitality.
If you continue to ride around, WHAT IS GIVEN, WHEN IT IS GIVEN, as if it had happened yesterday, it means taking the country's essential life force.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED writing in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use your phone, speak, explain, listen to, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than silence, the healthy word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you're going for," said Esme Nussbaum with a quiet voice, when she was sure that her superior had finished speaking, "and I say nothing but that we are not yet as effectively healed as we imagine ourselves.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves again in the way we repeat the mistakes that have only been made to THE WHO, when it has taken place.
This time, however, it is not the others in which we leave out our anger and our mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To point to an English patience.
"You go too far," he said, "if you call actions" errors "that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
You also go too far when you say that they would have left out their "anger" and their "distrust" to "others."
It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we are talking about "us" and "others" when we understand the past as well as the protection of the present.
There was no "we" and there was no "others."
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From the, if we are honest with ourselves," daring to throw in esme, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not suing anyone.
Whether it has been done bad or good, what has happened has happened.
That was back then.
There is nothing more to be said about this - we agree on that.
And just as no debt must be assigned, no debt must be repaid if such an eradication would be appropriate and if there was a way to eradicate it.
But what does the past serve if we don't learn from it -
The past serves to make us forget it.
If there's anything I can say about that...
Luther Rabinowitz had his pyramid collapsed.
"I will consider her report," he said, and he released her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcycle driver who, as passers described, had been on the road in a kind of "brutal rage."
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says that no coup is planned; Prime Minister stays in South Africa
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho refused to have planned a coup to overthrow the government and said they were going against police officers accused of armed political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and told them that the army of the country had surrounded his place of office and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The Prime Minister brought his family to the neighbouring South Africa after he had reported threats of assassination.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there was no de facto coup, but that the military responded to the threat of "political fanatics," whose armed forces were imminent by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of the defence forces of Lesotho acted after receiving several intelligence reports that within the police are acting some elements that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were about to cause devastating damage," he said to Voice of America.
South African government speaker Clayson Monyela said the military action had made the impression of a crash.
"Even though no one has claimed to have taken the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of the defence forces of Lesotho have so far shown signs of a coup," he said.
Spokespersons of the military of Lesotho announced on Sunday that the soldiers were retreating to their barracks and that the situation in the capital was quiet.
In the meantime, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing is taking over the government during Thabane's absence.
Thabane said that he believed that he had become the target for his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
There have been great tensions in Lesotho since June, after Thabane's parliamentary meetings were suspended because of the conflicts in his single government.
He said that his actions did not undermine the government, despite other accusations.
Production in the euro area at a 13-month low
The increase in production in the euro area slowed down in August to the lowest point in the last 13 months, such a closely observed study.
The final market manager code of the manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a level of 51.8 in July.
A figure above 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went down and factories experienced burglars in a time of increasing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures are received before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
The markets expect the Bank to have a clear plan to deal with a slow recovery of the euro area and the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, will be able to provide further information this week on whether to consider a quantitative relief for the euro area, in line with those made by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties on manufacturers have become clearer," said Rob Dobson, leading economic scientist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
In the meantime, in the second largest economic nation of the block, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a child of concern, as well as the decline of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
There is also no reassuring evidence that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism in Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, are no longer in use, "said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to stimulate the fire of the analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economic expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say for the purchasing manager code of the manufacturing industry in the euro area of August is that the sector continues to grow after that."
He added: "At the moment, producers in the euro area seem to find life rather difficult, as the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine - increase uncertainties in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and are likely to delay or even cancel some of the contracts, in particular large-scale contracts.
He said that it would be "more likely" that the ECB would eventually have to launch a kind of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
The Hellenzeitt of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children who are in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias at a school in Beslan, South Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death at the abomination in the classroom.
Just a decade after the horrific siege of the school of Beslan, where 334 people were killed, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When fanatic Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in abyss, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death at the abomination in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, even though the memory of this terrorist hell will persecute them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that is now haunting Ukraine - and in which children like it die - is now coming to an end.
The girl who was photographed trying to climb back into the broken school gym
She was photographed and famous by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakow when she was only trying to climb back into the broken school gym after a mine had exploded.
Aida was completely confused about her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were considered dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," said Aida back then.
My legs were flooded with blood.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier brought her to safety.
After a series of operations, she thought she was completely cured, but said yesterday: "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I have to be reoperated.
Some of the pomegranates are still in my knee.
Her goal is now to become a dentist to help the people as they were helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says.
"That happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to the gym to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I'm thinking about a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of her, although the memory is getting a little weaker every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our fears and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me online, as I climb back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and contribute to the fact that this is not happening again.
The boy who fled through the ball hail, in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at the age of 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven years old, he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she was gonna die.
She said to him, "Run."
Full of fear that she could be dead, he fled and saw a crying little child on the way, took it by the hand and fled through a ball hail.
His father Vladimir, who locked his son in his arms outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save them."
In fact, Tamara had stumbled out and with leg injuries in the hospital, in turn assuming that her son had died.
After she was reunited, she said, "I wept with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the now disbanded newspaper News of the World) to get the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion from the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's getting blender in my memory.
I remember right after that, I threw away all my toy guns.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes, and that's no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I'm not thinking about myself.
I remember those kids I was playing with in the yard and they didn't make it out there.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London very well, especially the toy store, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an open car.
But now he is afraid of place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends have suffered.
This horror is following you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry about all those who suffer from the abominations," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I'm so happy to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they take me to the school next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted for many months.
She remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London cried when I told our story.
I then understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the price and opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London, and how that helped Damir and me.
I remember how Damir wanted to eat Borschtsch and called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waiters in a restaurant, and Damir shot her with his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I always think that this world has not improved in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war continues now, and people die every day, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
They're just like our kids.
I think that for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that is so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he is not looking for revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past abominations.
I know he doesn't like to remember, but he has six close friends from the class, and they go to the gym sometimes and light candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered from it - I remember how he sometimes lay on the sofa, turned his face away from us for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, bigger than me, handsome, intelligent and healthy.
I can't believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came to my feet, I looked around, and saw hell around me, with all the body parts lying around.
I was absolutely sure my little boy couldn't have survived in this hell.
"I remember telling him," Damir, run, run, "but I was also so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard it, and he ran away.
And so life, unlike many others, goes on for us.
Geordu Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image after the siege became the symbol of the abomination of Beslan
consolation: The Beslan survivor Geordu Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege of 2004, on the right a picture of Geordu today
His blood-flooded face was drawn by fear when he ran around his life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of Beslan's barbarism.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him off for his first day of school before she rushed to take her older son Vladimir to university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three terrible days," she remembers.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives of ours, but they were all killed.
Only my Geordu managed to survive.
The closer this date is, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There's not a single day we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I mean, it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days are always following me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Impressive: The image of Geordu (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Geordu was so happy to go to school that day, he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I didn't know he was alive until I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Geordu in San Marino.
Geordu does not like to see the picture, and it is hidden at our home in the bookshelf.
I understand that, but I also mean that people all over the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Geordu says today: "It is important that such a thing can never happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People are constantly investigating such tragedies and never know the truth.
And now they're investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Are we ever gonna know what caused him?
This world is becoming something terrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does it happen?
Ten years is nothing in such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
It attacked my health, and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had some nightmares about the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I always go to the sports hall when September 1st comes closer.
I want to take my old childhood friends' tribute.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and went to a medical school in Wladikawkaz.
I'm gonna be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't let me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that's not gonna happen.
Geordu Faniyev, 20
The boy who survived even though he was caught at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Geordu Faniyev was caught at the foot of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege he was trapped in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb that was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We feel like it was yesterday," says Geordu, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret agent, but could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind.
I'm older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists and I actually felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I will never go back there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I have been in this famous picture.
Survivors: Geordu Fanijev today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never asked me about school.
I'm fine, physically.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I couldn't study at the FSB's secret service academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my records, including the medical records, and they answered that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows."
He said, "I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should know nothing about this and, of course, they should not suffer it either.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse when the anniversary comes closer.
I will go to the celebrations to commemorate.
I know Geordu's not going.
It's got to be a lot harder for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn't help him.
I am so grateful to God that he was given back to me. Here in Beslan all are drawn of it.
It stays within us.
Georgu is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept that when something so unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't take part because of his knee.
He's been operated on several occasions, he can walk, but he can't do sports.
I would say that he has overcome the horror to 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed at the siege, and that only strengthens my pain.
I've lost a lot of people I knew well and I've been expensive.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift God could make me, but my heart weeps for the dead.
I know about families where new children were born, but also about widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw him at the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now very close to our country, and I can't believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can we fight now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many are still being killed.
If we could just take these rebels and throw them out, as far away as we can.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby that was carried so violently by a special deployment command in safety
Saved: Aljona Tskajewa is secured by a Russian Special Operations Command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember at all the cruelty
The world stopped breathing in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian police officer from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let her go, but in her cruelty her 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar held back in the school gym.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.
Her father, Ruslan, has been married again since then and with his new wife, Svetlana, has a little girl that he named after his lost daughter, Kristina.
Aljona, today ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown up to be an intelligent and happy girl, say neighbors.
"You are now a great happy family, and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You'll understand why.
Man accused of having run over girls on foot crossing in five
A 78-year-old man is in court for the overrun of a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of having hit a girl on the transition to Pittenween in East Neuk.
The charges indicate that Mr. Steward controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and hurt the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, disobeyed the charges before the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC started the procedure for January.
4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to take photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The most cost-effective option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam such as the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, which are both available for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with several cameras, all available at a price of less than $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are some rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also set your camera to the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes that optimize the exposure time for the dusk underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is working.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search in our shop guide and reviews for digital cameras for traditional and waterproof models.
Make multiple recordings - because many will not work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD with which you can compose images, action cameras usually don't.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to look under water, and the right image setting is a matter of luck.
So take a lot of pictures.
If your camera has a series mode that makes a series of images with slightly changed exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse as you move away from the surface.
So, if possible, stay close to the surface when you take pictures in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This allows you to bring more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important under water because of the bad light conditions.
It is particularly important to work with an action cam: these devices often have a fixed wide angle lens, which means that you need to get closer to your objects if they are to fill in the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the kind whose character changes things, even in a giant organization like the NHS.
As an anaesthetic consultant, he devoted his career to the task of saving the sick both the agony of the disease and the pain of the treatment.
Among his patients, his wife remembers, was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the doctors are important for diagnoses and diseases, while the patients are mainly concerned with something quite different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May of this year.
I had trouble picking myself up.
While fighting with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he made impatient accusations to his wife Juliet.
"I'd rather do it now than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt unusually and without reason worried.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to do an X-ray on his chest.
It was only two weeks ago that he had been in the French Alps for skiing.
The result of the X-ray was available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the chest skin, that is, the skin that surrounds the lungs.
As with most cancer, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers are suffering from lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have been previously smokers.
But Mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fibre material, which was once considered a "miracle material" but has now been identified as fatal.
For most of us, Mesothelioma is a disease that can easily ignore.
After all, asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous asbestos type has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when industry voluntarily committed itself not to use it anymore.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain sectors worked directly with the material - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and yard workers, for example.
As an industrial dangerous substance from another time, it seems to be hardly worrying today.
But this complacency is inappropriate.
The UK, it seems, is experiencing today the peak of a mesolthelioma epidemic.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease as in traffic accidents.
Annual figures of Mesotheliomdeath cases since 1980 and expected future deaths in the UK
The reason why we are experiencing the deadly effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (all asbestos types were banned in 1999) is that a mesothelioma is only developing after decades.
And the scourge of the mesothelioma is not limited to former construction workers.
asbestos was, and is often still, present in the houses where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we learn and the shops where we shop.
And therefore Mesotheliom does not know any class barriers, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant stores in London to private schools, are not a safe room.
The Parliament buildings are contaminated with asbestos.
Even in hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy, this deadly carcinogen has already been identified as the starting point.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a plumber either.
It was indeed difficult for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years of my education," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and porters - use the tunnels.
You wonder how many of my old people will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer that question at least in part.
"Of the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital and who have been suffering from Mesotheliom in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one who is still alive."
How many of us are gonna get sick?
Mesothelioma was diagnosed with Andrew Lawson at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17 of this year, he was 55th
That was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends up dead.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will still be ill?"
The UK's leading expert on Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, if the asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to come to an end, a total of 90,000 of the disease will have been killed.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like this.

A short look at the files of the courts to which the parties often address for damages claims shows how far the scourge of the mesothelioma is already widespread.
In June this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Allen had been negligently exposed to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of which is the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started working at M & S.
Now she has two children in the twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I've never heard of Mesotheliom, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought that would affect me.
There are only a few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "asbestiform," a description of the fibre structure that makes the substance resilient and flexible.
Three of the six were used in construction.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is today by far the most frequently found asbestos in buildings.
It was used for roof plates, floor plates, tube insulation, boiler insulation, even for brake coverings in cars.
It is less fatal than other asbestos forms, but it is considered by the EU and the WHO to be a "great health risk" with possible death.
However, the brown asbestos (amosit) and the blue asbestos (crokydolith) are more dangerous.
Great Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a main reason for the unique high mesotheliomrates."
A staff member of Marks & Spencer was exposed to Alamy at the flagship store in Oxford Street, London, Abest
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is not unusual.
He has submitted a study of the parties concerned, which shows that "a significant proportion of mesothelioma was caused by work or in the home probably by asbestos contact in the environment without known suspension."
According to his statement, a large part of these contacts is based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can assume to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people could have been unknowingly exposed to the substance in the heart of the government.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines were contaminated with asbestos behind Parliament's committee rooms, whose deadly fibres could be inflated by something as harmless as "strong air movements."
Members of Parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it looks like the opposite is true.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Employment Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "clean health certificate," it is now undisputed that 1 billion pounds of work will have to be spent over a number of years to renovate Parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that after the general elections in 2015, MEPs will probably meet in the nearby QE2 conference centre rather than on the green banks in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the respective provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who could never exactly determine the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general physician.
As Andrew Lawson suspected the 50-year-old Abbott that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I have worked in a hospital where asbestos claims were positively decided," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so difficult to remember all the places you've been working on, and the data.
What he remembers is the day at the beginning of December 2009, on which he got such a kind of fever.
He was 45, and he was doing an operation just late in the evening.
All of a sudden, I had chills.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't make it home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain from the chest skin, the skin around his lungs was stirring.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors made X-rays of his chest and put on pleurakatether to remove fluid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained without diagnosis.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his workplace.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after sporting activity and heavy breathing.
In 2011, a patient abbotts with similar symptoms came into his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now Abbott did not link this with his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in that case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a probe equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the rib and the chest.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going, "he says.
To be honest, I didn't worry so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesothelioma
Suddenly Abbott had meetings with Macmillan nurses, one of whom recommended he take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he said.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now ill.
And so Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were under the ground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many of the employees who were in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another (such as Andrew Lawson) or in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were most likely in contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war, hospitals may have been life-saving for patients, but life-threatening for treating doctors.
It is still being removed today.
Students turned their bunsenburners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls due to its fabulous insulating and anti-flame properties.
Schools, too.
In fact, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
All over the country, in thousands of chemical hours, students have put their bunsenburners on asbestos mats.
The topic of asbestos in schools is now often addressed on the website.
And so, as innocent objects in our houses, such as floor plates or shed roofs, have included asbestos by default.
"It is an industrial poison that is contained in many parts of our property," says Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that a woman affected was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So watch your garden shed.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, are immense.
"It takes a while to process this," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I did.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I won't have another Christmas party.
With the greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
How countless patients before him he remembers how overwhelmed he was of all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very hard to record all this," he says.
"I asked my doctor" how much longer do I have? "
And I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I won't have another Christmas.
That's it. "
Mesothelioma is particularly treacherous because it is our life-support mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of the smallest fibres.
When the asbestos is inflated and the fibres are inhaled, they can be stuck in the chest skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate the chest skin and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhale-shaped asbestos fibres," says Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor who switched to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The hospital that Andrew Lawson suspected was exposed to asbestos is now ironically, a leading centre in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training at the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they are pressed from the breath process to the edge where the skin is.
From the very beginning, it is invasive.
The usual options for other cancers do not work so well with mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of an operation is, for example, highly controversial.
Some think she's worth a try.
Treasure denies that.
"You can't cut out the chest," he says.
They can't get around with the knife.
At the same time, cancer "does not respond very well to chemotherapy," which "shows effect," but does not heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After he had contacted Mesotheliom, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and advisory office for those involved four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, cancer center," he was happy to make calls.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years ago and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles, which would last four months and would probably only extend his life by one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, managed to "make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart-thorax specialist at the Guy's.
"We had an advantage by not having to be referred further, I just called and got an appointment," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and wait for the treatment to be approved.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients to be able to experience the best available therapies.
But if these treatments fail, at the end of the day, many people are concerned about another financial concern - about the future of the families that leave them.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that one realized that a very low burden also represented a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally settled their case, but it wasn't what Morgan called a "full compensation," because Lawson couldn't prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at the Guy's.
After the investigation into his death, however, a speaker of the Guy's confirmed that "the asbestos fibres in the affected cellar area were removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, for Mesothelioma patients who seek compensation, it is a huge problem to assign the deadly asbestos contact of a company or a job - usually decades after the events.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who defend themselves against claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response, there were clear new legislation this year, which makes it easier for Mesotheliom people to claim compensation, even if their former employers are no longer to be found.
The law has set up a fund of £350 million, supported by the insurance industry, for all those diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove a contact but cannot sue anyone.
In these cases, the applicants receive 80% of what a court could have given them in a normal compensation process - about £120,000.
About 300 successful applications for the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks, like so many Mesotheliom people, that £350 million was a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and indicates that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if the time had not gone over and Mesothelioma patients found the companies and could normally sue them.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pensions, also admitted that the law was "not perfect."
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that, in view of seven victims of death, rapid action was needed every day.
"People suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom law last December.
At that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After her first discussions, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation which, unlike Tom Treasure, is expected to have a positive effect.
This was accompanied by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a three-fold therapy that allows Lang-Lazdunski to present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt stronger.
"This is, of course, with the most important thing," says Abbott.
You see that in patients all the time.
There's something that's gonna keep you going.
If you give up, you'll get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott was under the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles.
After-care scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just became 50.
This is not life-threatening.
This is life-ending.
Abbott again underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of the tumours is visible.
But the process is physical and psychological very exhausting.
You have to think about practical things - about the money when I'm no longer, for example, or show my wife how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you get negative.
You need to look ahead.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl I had a disease I wouldn't be old with.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and undisturbed.
She told her friends, and we got a lot of calls soon.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such talks are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for Mesothelioma patients, such talks have not been through hope, not a trace of hope for survival.
The disease (as in the final analysis for Stephen Jay Gould) brings a grim safety.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China refuses Hong Kong right to government election, protesters swear retaliation
On Sunday, despite the increased call for democratic reforms, the Chinese Parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate.
This approach is likely to fire the long-announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists started planning and mobilizing them within a few hours after the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress basically allows the Communist leaders to reject all non-pecuniary candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
People have lied to the people of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defence of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the admission of public nominations to the elections to the Hong Kong Government would be "chaotic."
Since 1997, when Great Britain returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to have the people elected the government presidency from 2017 onwards.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision of Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because Hong Kong's citizens have a direct right to vote, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership is holding the process firmly in hand through a closely controlled nomination committee by Beijing.
A new clause is also intended to allow only candidates "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong."
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most popular protests have been held in Hong Kong for several years.
Behind the prodemocratic campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organisers have threatened to cut off the financial district if Beijing does not allow a real general right to vote.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had gathered in the rain in front of the Hong Kong government headquarters within hours of the announcement.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and that they were planning protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further information, apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organisers stated that the movement "has considered the occupation of the central district as a last resort, an action to take place only if all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to have to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for the Beijing announcement for days, and on Sunday in front of the government building there were increased security measures including police forces and barricades.
The unrest is reinforced by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The attraction of people from the mainland is increasing competition for products and services.
The fear is also growing that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of speech, will start to crumble under the increasing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticised the demonstrations of the Occupy Central movement, as it threatened the business - the lives of Hong Kong.
"The protests they are talking about could cause major economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long been critical of the movement.
We do not want to cause any fear that Hong Kong will get out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media have also recently reported on the democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western forces.
This summer, activists organised an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights in which 780,000 people participated - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
The tradition of school-leaving balls in the United States is now being transferred to the universities, where freshmen are offered performances with the private aircraft.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and to offer the first luxury UK travel service for students today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive performance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service has a security section.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to cuddle their belongings in a dangerous overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we are looking forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury this year.
One company speaker said that there were no new bookings as the service had just been introduced, but added that "students would book the service in the next few weeks."
The company also announced that despite the tuition fees of £9,000 per year it would expect a market for this offer.
Students today are very different in their expectations and demands from the students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do exactly that.
The National Student Union, however, criticised the service as being withdrawn.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NIS for Higher Education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the life of the majority of students.
Many students who start their studies this month are facing a crisis in the cost of living, as the available grants in the form of loans and scholarships do not keep pace with the much-increasing invoices for the simplest living bases before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as the arrival at the student home.
Feminists Critique Racial Question and Police Behavior After Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed at the beginning of this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo...
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while waiting for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators set the gender before the race when it comes to addressing the right of reproduction and income inequalities.
However, while the tensions in the Middle West increased and were taken into account throughout the country, Perez saw that the answers of white women were 100% around the race.
Compared to the answers of black women shortly after the shots of August 9, the personal essays came with titles such as "thoughts about Ferguson of a white woman" and "feminism is not just about the oppression of women" relatively late.
But for Perez, that meant an important change.
"I don't think there are many people in feminism who are talking about white and talk about privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnized that they must express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell from Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems that black Americans are exposed to every day, but are not considered "women's issues" in the cultural area.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about myself and my partner and get 150 like from anywhere," said Mitchell.
If I post something about how colored people are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk public about a relationship, but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, sex and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between race and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury to clean up the issues; they live in the combined reality every day.
While white women now connect the issues of race and gender in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the murder of Lynch.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came at the point where white women fighters for women's right to vote, such as Susan B. Anthony, analysed the country in the late years of the 19th century, and found that the fight for the right to vote could only be successful for one group: women or black.
"They made the decision to vote for the right to vote for women, and the right to vote for black people should come later," said Hattery.
When you remember such things, you become aware with power why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade to set up white women against Lynchen in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was born almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the issues raised by Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminist "catch" played with the problems that black women have been dealing with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms took the right to education as seriously as they do with the right to conception control?" Mitchell asked.
Second-generation feminists who built their career in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptive drugs are now trying to understand what that means.
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steiner went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, in which she asked for more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions on the race that are clearly different in public surveys - will lead the changes," wrote Steiner.
Although Steiner stands for a rather intersectional feminism in which racial and gender issues are addressed, some of her comments on racial issues in America are astonished.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steine's comments on Ferguson are contrary to her previous criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently imposed a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steiner.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that is in the foreground of mainstream feminism.
After the US border police has taken up almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the south-west border of the country this year, the issue of immigration reform is also on the surface - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for the reform of immigration, said that for a reconsideration of the issue as a major women's issue, they only have to publish the stories of the immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the large majority of the work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a sustainable way in women's organisations," she said.
"Pig house" in Ipswich is for sale
The picture of a house for sale was removed from real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig that it had made comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has one bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for £120,000.
The details included a picture of the house's living room - one of which also belonged to a pig who had prayed his head on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connell said the pig in the photo was the pet of the owner.
"However, the photo was mispublished and has been removed by now," said a spokesperson of the company.
In the exhibition of the house, Connells described the former assembly house as a "unique single-family house with one bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The sale of the house was a matter of interest in the social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW-City of Harvey is home to a new millionaire after Lottowin
A lottery player from Harvey is on this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth is continuing with a happy winner who will receive almost $1.1 million from the lottery education on Saturday.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey moved the jackpot for the second time in five years in the drawing of the first division, after $1 million in November 2009.
The lucky winner, however, still has to report.
The shop owner Steve Forward said that the profit provides for conversation material in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city is not talking about anything else, and everyone's pretty excited.
We thought that such a profit could occur.
Eight WA winners have celebrated wins in the first division last month, a due degree for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont had only achieved the $7.5 million mega win a few weeks before.
The winner couple had been playing for twenty years and said that the profit allowed them to travel the world and buy a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas asked for the gladiator arena
Not only the gladiators were in the Matsch at the first Rheinbacher Römertag in the leisure park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract far more than 1000 visitors yesterday, who defied the rain showers and the autumn cold and were undisturbed by the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful ripening of performances, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the Martian fighter group of the gladiator school "Amor Mortis," which used every rain break to demonstrate its robust martial arts in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and expert presenter and sent his men into the ring in succession for a heroic two-fight in various gladiator engagements.
First, the "provocators" were on the line with a rectangle sign and short sword as well as leg rail on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm.
It followed the "Essedarii" with chest shield, short sword and wurflanze as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
The appearance of the "Retiarius," which came up against the "Secutor with a litter net, trident and dagger, was particularly impressive, and after a short fight the boy came to the ground.
As the swords force metal to each other, the shields created and the wurfflanzen flew surgically through the arena that could become a fear and fear for the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis," the muscular referee, had an ever-attentive eye on them.
"We wanted to relive the Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era to experience," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, Chairman of the "Friendship of the Roman Canal," the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the leisure park became a "oppodium Romanum," a Roman city, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage said in his greeting.
Finally, the Romans have not only brought war and conquest to our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
The remains of this were also to be admired at the Roman Day, about "aqueduct marble" of the 11 m high and 1400 m long Roman Canal bridge, which was once at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus society once and now faced the water and energy supply, and Managing Director Petra Fricke knew: "We are still taking advantage of the knowledge of that time."
This is also confirmed by the "Engineering team Two" of Rheinbach, which introduced the instruments of measurement of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations anno 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocaust, the hot air heating that once heated the Roman villa.
Impressive also the footprints that were left by Wolf and Fuchs in the footsteps of clay two millennia ago before they were burned.
In 2011, the Office for the Conservation of the Land of the Rhine had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the Nord industrial park in Rheinbach.
They have found the surrounding walls of an economic building with a darre for drying cereals and painting.
The building was probably part of a Villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, explained the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of pieces of information from these excavations she presented in a glass vitrine, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a petite necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the German invasion of the then Roman Rhine, Morscheiser is suspected.
The children also dealt with the Roman windmill game, similar to today's mill game, or, as the Roman students once wrote their names on the table with metal handles.
At the stand of the Roman thermal Zülpich the children of Mosaics were allowed to lay themselves to make glass mosaics at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach and to serve a heavy wheat mill of stone at the stand of the natural centre of Eifel Nettersheim in order to grind the flour for a flask or a cereal.
The original Roman travel car, which was drawn by two cold flowers, was used to drive visitors through the leisure park and also passed the impressive state of the city high school, which presented the results of their "Roman project weeks."
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also be involved in the Roman year 2014, which is to be remembered by Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the home and history associations as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the Partnership Association and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes are offered and the Roman past of Wachtberg is remembered.
For example, a Roman legionaire will tell of his work on the appropriate Wachtberg, present plants as living monuments from the Roman era and offer a funny lesson in international understanding between a group of Wachtberger "Germany" and attracted Romans.
The Adendorfer primary school is dedicated to the Roman theme within the framework of a project week.
With the Roman Week, the numerous, but often no longer visible, traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be experienced again.
In the Wachtberger City Hall, a small presentation will remember the discovery of the Berkumer Matron shrine in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic burdens West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies go at a distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is a serious blow to the economy of West Africa.
The harvest rotates on the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are orphaned - the virus has been hard to add to the region.
Some international companies are already at a distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one," explains the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is most affected
"It's a total disaster, we're losing a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes on the second largest market in Liberia's capital, Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something to disinfect Ebola are on the market.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus, but here alone more than 600 people were killed.
The health authorities have recently stated that the disease has passed through every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1500 people have already died, and thousands of others have been infected.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Companies are out of business all over the resource-rich countries.
Foreign companies such as the steel company Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees, and several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions.
The local traders and farmers also respond: few merchants still leave their home places to get supplies.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, among other things, the cocoa and coffee beans that are important for export rot on the fields.
The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is scarce
"People will travel less and less," says Phillip De Vreyer, Paris's expert in the economy of West Africa.
The man, for example, who usually goes on the market and sells his vegetables, would rather stay home.
The population therefore gets the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently to feel: food becomes scarce.
On the markets, the stock of basic food is disappearing like rice.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, is at risk of an image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The greatest danger is that international companies will avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
It is important to know how far and how long the virus will spread.
Investors could have the impression that "it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus to invest," Hugon warns.
The disease also burdensome the strained state budgets of the States
The disease also burdens the state budgets of the States concerned, which are already tight.
The Moody's credit rating agency is afraid that their budgets will be strongly strained by the high expenditure on the health system and, in addition, by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the countries concerned with $60 million (EUR 45 million).
The effects are also noticeable in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far.
The oil-rich region in the southern Nigerian delta has not been affected so far.
But elsewhere, many people are already at home for fear of infection.
Reservations in hotels also go back significantly.
Shooters celebrate their 50th anniversary
The Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau is celebrating its 50th anniversary from September 12 to 14.
At the Schützenverein Tannenwald, the preparations for the 50-year-old foundation festival will be held from 12 to 14 September.
On Friday, September 12, a big entertainment evening is planned with the group "Dorfrocker."
On Saturday at 6: 00 is the big bad-ass shooting.
Then there is the big festival of the mood evening with the "Stapfälzer Spitzbuam."
Bloskapelle takes care of the music
The highlights on Sunday are the FestGottesdienst and 9.30 am in the parish church and the great feast at 2 pm.
In the afternoon is also the price distribution of the Federal and Gausschößen.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 Festdamen with their Dirndln.

The patronage has been taken over by Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when on March 21 the association for "social entertainment by practice in the carpentry and small caliber shooting" was founded.
The Nazi regime had led to the dissolution of the club in 1937.
It was only in 1964 that 19 young men were found who, on April 30, raised the "new" Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau from the Baptism.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the club as a protection master through a difficult start time, in which it was mainly about finding a club location and installing the shooting operation.
In the autumn of 1965, the Schützenverein started in the "Leininger" guest house with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sportsmen, who were now organized in seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club records peeled every year and the magic border of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
As the performance of the active shooter has increased, the number of members has also developed positively.
After the club hall "Leininger" no longer met the demands of a modern protection club, the then board under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future domizil in the basement rooms of the new "Landhost Härteis."
After a work performance of 2700 hours on 8 May 1988, Father Strasser gave the church blessing for the new protection rooms.
One of the great highlights in the history of the club was certainly the 44th Gausschöfen, combined with the solemn consecration of the new protection flag in July 1991.
On April 23 and 24, 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30-year anniversary.
In 1995, a Böllergruppe was founded.
= = References = = = = External links = =
A major challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the Bayerische Böllermeeting in 2005.
In many hours of voluntary work, last year the club members modernized the rooms and the shooting facility in the Berngau Hof and brought it to the latest state of the art.
Eleven teams in round competitions
The sports services of the protection association can also be seen.
A total of 11 teams are currently taking part in the round competitions: six air-gun teams, an air-gun team, a sports gun KK1, a youth and two AH teams.
The first team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann went up from the Gauoberliga in the 2013-14 season (the highest league in the ANB) to the district league 1.
The second team, with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml, went up from the Gauliga North to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to the shooting, events such as boxing, carnival and royal ball, club trip and Christmas party have tradition.
The shooters are also at the parties in parish and community.
Tony Stewart suffers an accident on return to the race track
Tony Stewart's return to the race ended about half way through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart went against the wall for the second time after his right front tire broke in round 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team chief Chad Johnston said his 14-member team was disappointed, but now focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better commitment and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart was already in a wall at the race on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car fixed.
"I came up with quite good hopes today for a good result," said Johnston, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the tug and the team had packed and was ready to go.
Stewart dropped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit another driver in an ashore race in the north of the state of New York and killed him.
He decided to return this week and win either Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had entered the track during a race to confront Stewart.
The authorities informed on Friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been taken as to whether Stewart has to expect an indictment.
The three-time champion was received with great applause when he was presented before the race.
After a start at 12th position, Stewart had already moved to the first 10 and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a restart in round 122, Buschs got
Car with number 18 out of control after the exit from curve 2 and collided with Stewart, with both cars driving against the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell back to number 21.
Dance-happy young people wanted
Just try out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and director Lisa Neitzel (from the left) are looking forward to co-conspirators.
Like many other associations, the jazz groups in the TV Jahn also make the whole-day lessons at the secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have been heavily decimated.
Now more young people are being sought for a sport that is healthy and is great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits," there are only nine children left.
"Three in the group of eight to twelve years old, six in the group of twelve to 15 years old," says the 20-year-old.
With more active, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance completely different choreographies," she says.
If you want to dance on Thursday between 5: 00 and 6: 00 p.m. or on Friday between 5: 00 and 6: 30 p.m. in the dance room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, will be able to sneak into the training hour without obligation.
"The training starts regularly with a warm-up program," says the trainer.
After that, various choreographies were practiced.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no defined form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore, classical to sports and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, the sociality is not too short.
"We also go to dinner, watch dance movies, and we have also spent the night in the dance room," says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friends, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
If you do not like jazz dance, you can also sniff into one of the other offers of the TV Jahn.
Children and young people can always get into school for weeks in the fields of children's dance / jazz dance, Bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip hop.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult pairs are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
If you want to see discofox, slow waltz, Viennese waltz, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango, you can come and join us.
Bulgarian prison guards protest across the country
Hundreds of prison staff from all over Bulgaria have organised a country-wide protest before the Ministry of Justice in Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Higher salaries are also on a list of claims to be discussed with the Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov.
The officials have been symbolically protesting the new working hours for a month and calling for a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the union of prison staff and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the national Bulgarian ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations continue, the Director-General for the implementation of criminal measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov shared the BNR.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the union union of employees of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian army has given up airport of Luhansk
In the eastern Ukraine, the prorussian fighters are still on the rise.
After heavy battles, which were allegedly also involved in Russian tank battalion, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, gave up the airport of the Luhansk Rebelenhochburg.
The army also announced that seven soldiers had been killed in the last 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personal consequences from the severe defeat of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the supreme army leadership without mentioning details.
Proussian separatists shot down plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government forces, a fight aircraft and two military helicopters were shot down again, according to their own representation.
In addition, some 100 soldiers were injured or killed in battles in the Donetsk region, according to the insurgents, Russian agencies reported on Monday.
Ships of the Coast Guard sunk
The insurgents also claimed to have sunk two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard for the first time in the Aegean Sea.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of his ships were under fire on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
There were seven border guards injured, one speaker in Kiev told the station 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media held Russia responsible for the incident.
The separatists also reported that they had brought several villages in the Donetsk area under their control.
Diplomatic offensive in the United States - YpagesUSA.com
The Ukraine Contact Group is meeting today in the Belarusian capital of Minsk.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy of the separatists from East Ukraine should also participate.
In advance, all actors used their performances to make their demands public.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the planned stations in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday that NATO was following the founding agreement of the 1997 NATO-Russia Council.
The NATO chief, however, accused Russia of "a massive break" in the agreement.
"Today we must face the reality that Russia does not consider NATO as a partner," Rasmussen said.
The documents and opinions from Russia show "that they regard us as opponents."
Strengthening NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced its intention to strengthen NATO's presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to be adopted at the NATO Summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as necessary," said Rasmussen on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas calls
According to official information, Russia and Ukraine have agreed on new discussions to settle their gas dispute.
The negotiations were scheduled for next Saturday, said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak on Monday.
It is still waiting for a decision by the European Union whether it will also send a representative to the discussions.
Because of the dispute over the gas price, Ukraine has not been getting fuel from Russia for weeks.
Last, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had communicated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also stop gas supply for Europe.
Europe has about one third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks the word of power: toll will come "quite clear"
The Chancellor is now clearly committed to this.
But it is not a free letter for all the complicated details.
The CSU's persistent concerns about car tolls from the CDU have been a growing concern.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a power word for the introduction of a car toll after continuing resistance from her CDU.
"To make it quite clear, she is in the coalition treaty, and she will come," said the party chief on Monday after meetings of the CDU-top bodies in Berlin.
However, Merkel did not rely on a detailed model for the time being.
In the black-and-red government programme, "certain parameters" are called.
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrendt (CSU) has "made a proposal and is now working on it."
The NRW-CDU, however, is on its no to a toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) was also constructive in the discussions for a draft law.
In addition, he also talked to Dobrendt about further ways of activating more private capital for investment in infrastructure, for example in broadband development.
"There's nothing special about it." Schäuble had left a "mirror" report uncommented on Sunday, his house is examining its own concept to pay for motorway investors with toll revenues - after the 2017 election.
CSU Chief Horst Seehofer then warned against developing toll concepts in the cabinet against the leading minister.
CDU-Bundesvize Armin Laschet reiterated his objections.
"The Coalition Treaty never assumed that all the district and federal roads would be covered," said the North Rhine-Westphalia CDU President.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced that he will talk about the subject again.
The CDU national associations Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate also oppose the plans.
The background concerns that a toll affects small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had asked for a coalition trust for the toll criticism from the CDU.
The left sees the plans as failure in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks toll is dead," said party chief Bernd Rioxinger of the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
"The Minister fails with the toll." Dobrendt wants to introduce a vignet obligation on all German roads to start in 2016.
However, according to the Coalition Treaty, domestic car owners may not be subject to additional burden.
They are therefore to receive a full compensation for the toll via the car tax.
The model must not, however, penalise foreign drivers in accordance with EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A British says that as a result of a misdiagnosis for many years, she thought she was going to die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she had to live only a few years after she had been diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from the Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
About 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disturbances such as muscle weakness, unsafe movement and curved toes.
Diseases also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she was suffering from Friedreich-Ataxie (FA) - a disease with very bad chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she was sitting in the wheelchair before she was 18, and she died before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is 51 years old today, said: "As a child I knew that I could not do the same as the others.
I fell down all the time and everything took me longer.
I could never ride with the other kids roller skate or skateboard and was often hanged in school because of my way of going and running.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several operations to relieve her Achilles' tendon and stretch her feet, she saw her medical records when her doctor left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home looking for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA society," she said.
When I got an answer, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I'd be in the wheelchair at 18 and die at 25, and in between, all my skills would be lost.
I made all this out with myself and planned my own funeral.
She said that when she became 17, she realized that her skills had not been as low as she had imagined and questioned her doctor.
He just got up and hugged me and said, "My love, I don't think you have that, otherwise you'd be in the wheelchair already."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, CMT was established.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT-Awareness month to draw attention to this disease.
Stabbfeldwebel A. D. Berni Dieter has been working as a fireworker since the closure of the former troop practice site
For almost ten years, the former military training site in Münsingen has not been shot.
However, every month, killing ammunition still appears at the heart of the Swab region of the biosphere.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be blown up on the ground.
An ear-numbing bang is raging in the blast over the heart of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot was shot at the Münsingen troop training site, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since that time, the area of 6500 hectares has been the core of the Swab region of the biosphere, which is open on 13 designated routes for hikers and cyclists.
Tax burden on business people in the Washington area increases with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rulings for companies in the country increased slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, such a newly published study last week, and the companies in the Washington area were no exception.
In 2013, companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia together paid $27.6 billion to government and local authorities, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to the 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The government and local tax burden of companies increased by 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent in the previous year, and it was the third year of growth in a row after the several years of declining decisions in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes, by 4.3%, according to the study carried out by the service agency Ernst & Young with the Centre for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of the city's income comes from companies.
Virginia has the lowest tax revenue from companies at 28 percent.
A large part of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in the real estate values of companies, the researchers say, which led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While a large part of these profits came from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the process also seems to be in the Washington area.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia together paid over $10 billion in government and local real estate taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 percent over a year.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in increasing state and local tax revenues, as real estate taxes are just over a fifth of the tax burden of companies.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, the following is happening: a large part of the real estate, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or non-profit organisations that do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, managing director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced, for example, to rely much more on income taxes in order to provide the same services that other countries offer.
The recent recovery in company tax revenues cannot be attributed to the recovery of the real estate market alone
Business income also seems to recover, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes for state organisations of $2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland recorded $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend is in the same direction, the local tax burden on companies does not increase evenly in all three places.
The increase in the district was 4.3% in line with the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only Virginia reported a below-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
With 6 percent in all three branches, Virginia has the significantly lowest corporate income taxes (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The company tax rate in Maryland is 8.25% and in the district is relatively high 9.975%.
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia lower government and local corporate taxes are required and overall a better tax climate is in place than in Maryland.
The study did not examine the district.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbours.
North Carolina has adopted laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the State continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the State's corporate income tax rate to 3% by 2017.
In the meantime, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, and they therefore pay more state and local taxes, according to the recent study.
Company taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business people - a transitional structure according to which most small enterprises are organised - in the district, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, a much faster rate of growth than the total corporate taxes.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes throughout the country is likely to continue this year, with an increase of 6.2% for the state and local governments in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
However, the Washington area could be lagging behind if the government's reduction in expenditure had an impact on the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hopfen and malt - also in China a popular combination.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight link between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's partner city of Guangzhou - this is the urgent wish of the officers in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery would settle down in our city," said the Vice-Party Secretary of the South Chinese Metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week when visiting a SPD delegation in his city.
Over and over again, the official of the Chinese ruling Communist Party came back to this concern of the Twelve million metropolis in the course of the discussion.
Guangzhou, also known as Canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China, was Li.
This is why people also have the purchasing power to afford German beer.
The Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would be listening to a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, cereals and joy of life," he added at lunch with the party's top party in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already exudes Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
The official from Guangzhou then arrived with Schäfer-Gümbel - but with red wine, which was served for the food.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao is based on German brewing.
Tsingtao-beer is brewed according to the German order of purity.
More business
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight link between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice-Party Chief Li.
Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but in 2012 it was cancelled for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again," the local politician was convinced.
"Business between our two cities is growing."
At the moment, travellers had to take the detour of Changsha in Hunan Province, Li complained.
The administration of the province of Guangdong, whose capital is Guangzhou, also hopes for the airport.
The vice-governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this wish in the foreground in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," said Schäfer-Gümbel - the Chinese viceminist Li Jinjun, an intimate knowledge of Germany, nodded in agreement.
Mainly maintained partnership
The key vice-president of Guangzhou hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already at the main, but not yet in this function.
He only came into office this year after his predecessor had been promoted out of office for corruption allegations.
The local party chief Wan Qinglian also had to go.
The action against the officials from Guangzhou is part of a country-wide campaign against corruption in party and administration, which is enforced with strength by Head of State Xi Jinping.
The new top political leader Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is very unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top-level manager in Fujian, where the car builder VW built a great work.
Frankfurt has officially received more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to the 9000 km away Guangzhou is one of those maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year the 25-year existence of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolis on the river of the pearl is almost as strong as all of Hesse with its economic power.
In the next year, it wanted to achieve a gross domestic product of EUR 250 billion, reported Li.
Family of Joan Rivers "pushes the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since she was admitted to a hospital in New York City three days ago, but her daughter has been hopeful today that the 81-year-old comrade is recovering from her illness.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," said Melissa Rivers today in a communication.
We're all pushing our thumbs.
According to her mother, sources were admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency due to cardiac arrest at a hospital on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors keep them deliberately sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as "serious."
The reactions came from many sides, also in the form of an overwhelming online support of Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
In future, more stringent environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners that are on the market from now on.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from 1 September on which the buyer can at a glance see central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, more stringent nitrogen oxide values are applied in the "Euro 6" class of pollutants.
There is also more money for the scaffolding companies: they receive a nationwide minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys switch for 1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: the online retailer - and video producer, and a lot of other things - is buying the video streaming service Switch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected to take over of Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google's video service was for a cool billion decided thing, and the cooperation also seemed natural.
Switch, which was founded three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravour pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games," an insider.
The switch interface.
And "let's play," a video genre in which better people give the (mostly older) games a cover of secret science theaters, are already very popular on YouTube.
It's just that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was a little bored, a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube was not made, as the company was reported to be willing to pay as much as Amazon did.
All we know about this right now is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Switch: "We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret is, to be honest, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who explain that they prefer to play sports rather than watch it, it is difficult to understand the attraction that is based on watching others while playing, rather than even taking control console into their hands.
It's one thing to look over a friend at 3: 00 in the morning, while she's sneaking through Resident Evil, and something quite different, watching a nut get shot in the head 20 times in a row in call of duty.
All these games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without your own control over the perspective can be a really good recipe for headache.
I admit that the fast runs in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age perform all the games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there is no game or humor virtuosis, his switch channel is probably not very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Switch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money out of it?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch is integrated into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could have just swallowed.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: thousands of young men who are being recruited as advertising customers.
As the president of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "believe both in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of a shrinking, not even - swallow - as a spectator.
There was a lot going on on Sunday at the Hüpfburg at the Burggartenfest.
The concept of the organizers was in line.
Despite the strong rain on Saturday night, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
In time, the inlet had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Saltwater l Light and fun.
Two Spanish words have been called Amula by Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem.
For the open air in the Salzwedel Burggarten is to radiate brightness in the day and evening through various shows.
And the fun comes on its own anyway.
This was already shown on early Sunday, when the first visitors opened up to open air.
The organizers had promised a festival for all generations.
And they did that.
Around the supply levels on the Burggartenwiese, Salwädeler, but also guests from the nearby and further surroundings had made themselves comfortable.
They followed the first live performances, waved with the foot in the bar, enjoyed cool drinks - short: relaxation pure and enjoyment were recommended.
And that's across the generations.
While the one on the ceilings on the extra-carried white sand were raging at the beach bar, the others were on a quarter of wine in the vinothek, the young people on the hill castle were raging, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But also in the case of child-making, the volunteers had to do all their hands full in the truest sense of the word in order to become the master of the urge and to spell imaginative creations into the small faces.
The larger ones used the kickertables or participated in a skateboard workshop that the Goodfoot crew from Salzwedel arranged.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5: 30 he was talking to the visitors, especially families looking for the wide and dry.
But the attraction of the festival did not stop.
"More people came than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success on the whole."
That is why there is nothing to prevent a repeat of the big party next year.
Although the content and size of the event still needs to be worked out, Sem made it clear in a first review on Sunday against the popular vote.
As an annoyance, he said that in the meantime the inlet had to be stopped.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little power.
The result: some who had already paid did not get to the site.
The response was very good.
In a first careful estimate, the Salzweidel co-organiser spoke of about 1200 visitors who were rambling in the Burggarten.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedeler Hip-Hop-Band Blocks'n'Rox therefore broke off their performance.
The technicians were unable to create a semi-reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built, because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel because of a tire range.
"But next year they will be there," said the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula Open Air was more than successful by the number of visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes, which will be rejected the first time, but must be removed in the second edition.
The organizers must also be critical in the social network Facebook.
"Sorry, but for 12 euros you just expected more," says Melanie Meier on the event side.
"Unfortunately, you have taken over a little," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems as very closely.
I think it is very good that some people not only talk stupid, but also really try to put something on their feet.
Hut off!, "writes Stephanie Jenß to the Amula.
Now the organizers have a year to stop these critical points.
New Racy in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark is shrinking
This is not what it is expected.
Instead, the ready-to-use component is waiting to be used in the distinctive building.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the establishment of the space observation radar TIRA, the shell, the so-called radom, is completely renewed.
The new radom will be slightly smaller with a diameter of 47.5 meters than the old one.
But the size still remains world record.
The last step to complete the new shell is the change of cap
The upper quarter of the old shell is separated and taken off with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new shell will be set up.
As far as the weather is concerned, the action is to go through the stage at the beginning of this week.
Participants in the Ice-Bucket Challenge will be in the process of getting Kiefer
Isabelle Roberts from the UK screamed so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she hurt the bone structure of her face.
This ice-bucket challenge was a pain in the ass.
A woman was admitted to the hospital after she screamed so much at the Ice-Bucket Challenge that she got rid of the jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from the UK crept so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she hurt her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I did, my jaw just stopped," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is spilled over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but I couldn't, the jaw was chopped, and then I understood something was wrong.
My mother and sister saw that, too, and they almost got into their pants with a smile, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was admitted to the hospital to get the jaw reinstated after taking part in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Are the Burgclubs going to pull back on a line soon?
The last time there was a twist between the two Woltzhauser Burgveinen.
Now the board is thinking about possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Woltzhauser Castle, the late Richard Dimpath, former chairman of the Woltzhauser Burgfreunde, led the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunde Wolttshausen.
The views so far seem to be quite different, as the history of the Woltzhauser Castle and a possible reconstruction are to be dealt with.
The two camps are now moving towards each other: discussions on a common approach are to be held soon.
This is confirmed by the board of directors Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffle (Burgfreunde) at the request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr Piffle and proposed that we should be together once," says Sjöberg.
In his view, all the members of the two associations could in future rejoin forces.
In this way, there are faster visible successes.
While the castle friends around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimpath had until the last in mind a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest, the "discovery and experience" of the site is at the forefront for the castle club around Sjöberg.
Herbert Piffle, second president of the castle friends, has been very pleased to hear about the call according to his own information.
He has been leading the castle's friends since his death.
A new chairman will be found in a meeting in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the club currently has about 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimpath, we first left the association activities to rest for respect." This "thought phase" was necessary to "consider how it could go on."
According to Piffle, the new chairman is to go into the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the castle friends could also make up a current mood within their group.
A candidate for the Presidency is not yet available, says Piffle.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He does not want to run for his own, because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman was supposed to be a Woltzhauser.
The Tölzer wanted to work on the project "but very much wanted to continue."
The different positions on reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffs in the near future.
He commends Dimpath as a "missionary," who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, well-advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock.
They are a tourist magnet by a high level of participation by the population and by voluntary helpers from all over the world.
Piff: "I too was skeptical at the beginning.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to drive the project forward. "A" single-position feature "could be created for the city of Flößerstadt.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be financed by EU grants, visitors' tickets and potential sponsors, Piff believes.
"I personally do not want to throw the idea of reconstruction over board." He hopes that the Burgverein may move something on this point.
Their aim to document the story first is "important and good."
After that, you could keep looking.
Smart ways to save at university textbooks
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 a year, the fast-term student Matt Schroeder considered a clever sparidee.
He invented a loan system for higher-semester students' books and offered a nominal compensation to delay the sale back.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A-cookie," said Schroeder, 19, who is visiting Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college management informed that on average, students spend more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study material, but that there are different cost-reduction options for students.
Online shops and creative approaches such as the Schroeder are increasingly the solution of the choice for students.
The rent of textbooks is becoming more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when they buy.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookshops, announced that the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books were rented in the college bookshops in the last spring semester, said Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks are bought in campus bookshops according to the Trade Association National Association of College Stores.
Here's the one-time deal for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books online cost only one third of the price for which they are to be found in the Campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be purchased from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy Used
If you don't mind the notes of other or normal traces of use, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is needed to have on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold new for $48.
Academists such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls recommended students to ask their professors if previous expenses were allowed.
Sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older expenditure can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest expenditure.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com from eBay Inc is a popular alternative to used books.
Rent
The renting of textbooks is worth considering if you treat them fairly well, remember to give them back and you do not want to keep the books after the course has been completed.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Find out about the terms of the business where you rent, including the penalty fees that may apply to writing notes, underwriting or traces of use.
Beware: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time by wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc..
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, as many classics can be downloaded free of charge today, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
I mean, look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be visiting the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the award of books, as one can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before an online order you should check, so Gault, if the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery time and finally paid the full price at the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" didn't become a cash-exchange bat
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone recorded less than 30 million dollars of his 90 million dollars budget in the United States, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" recorded only 12 million dollars of his budget of 70 million dollars.
The film "Sex Tape" was cut to Cameron Diaz at the opening weekend only $14.6 million, while children's films like "Dragons made easy 2" also disappoint in the revenue.
An article by the telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that in children's films the lack of quality could be the reason for the films themselves.
In 2014, Collin referred to as "the worst year" for children's films and described "dragon seams made easy 2" as "pure" functional "fantasy sequel.
For films for a slightly older target group, however, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic evaluation for each summer film start, which was shown between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and in the current year on at least 2000 screens.
The results are based on the views of cinema visitors and film critics and indicate that this year's film hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing vision habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's soon-to-be jungle book film, said to the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think the times are changing."
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of the Hollywood production, Netflix recently achieved sales with the streaming content of $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year, in which sales were $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticised the film studios for concentrating too much on comics' movies and prophesied a "nuclear fusion" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his dark prophecy may well contain a true core.
However, due to the potential cash losses expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the drop in cash results as simply "cyclic" and said to Hollywood reporters: "The next summer will be the biggest summer at the Kinokasse at all, and no one will worry about the business anymore."
When a few years ago the second table tennis district class was removed for the purpose of streamlining the leagues division, this has been a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Association has taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the program.
The result is that if you are not up, you are down.
For example, Göttingen's top-class team, Torpedo, in the Oberliga-Relegation, has avoided the descent, but in the coming season only five-tier.
In the fourth class, Torpedo's ladies remain, despite their great way through the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony League, as well as the boys of the SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo reserve are in the new association league, in the Landesliga there are no more Göttinger clubs.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website * Official website
What the composition looks like a better district class is now the new district soberliga south.
TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Ober der SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and the TTC.
In the district league, the regional representative Dtransfeld and the SC Weende play, in the district class of the TTC II, Red-White, the upper SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III. The district league of the ladies starts at least in a solid strength.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with the game.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen start in the district league.
With nine teams each
The SC Weende is sending his girls to the small district league.
Also the district league season of the SCW boys - there still starts Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the upper SV go to the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttinger districts start with nine teams each.
In the West season are the Red-White II, Upper SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dtransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
In the East season, Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play among others.
The Women's Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemelen, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the Osterode district, where there are no women's teams at all at the circle level.
Remarkable that none of the six second circle classes can achieve the strength of the target, here the innovative and controversial circular board will already have to think about it.
Nato Summit: First Protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests from opponents of the Nato Summit in Newport.
On Saturday hundreds of people gathered in the centre of Newport to an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the city hall there to hold a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough has been following developments for us this weekend and has spoken to protesters who have travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers flown out of the Blue Mountains
Two young bus hikers were safely brought to safety with the wind of the rope after being caught in the Blue Mountains in NSW during the night.
The 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man just after Sunday morning in Govets Leep in Blackheath left for their tour.
Asked relatives called the police at about 8: 00 when they didn't return home.
A search team from local police and rescue services broke up and the couple was found near the Bridal Veil waterfalls at about 23 o'clock.
The girl had hurt himself on the knee and the man had fallen and had his head opened.
Rescue personnel stayed overnight with the couple, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were delivered to the Blue Mountains Hospital in a stable state with an ambulance.
Eradicating anti-government protests in Pakistan
The about 1000 demonstrators were forced out of the PTV building by soldiers, said information minister Pervaiz Rashid.
The transmitter resumed the broadcast after about half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said that the protesters equipped with sticks had damaged equipment in the editorial department.
The dead or the injured have not been reported.
The protesters are calling for the resignation of the head of government, to whom they are accusing of electoral fraud.
The police reported that about one kilometre from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, there had been another clashes of about 3000 protesters with security forces on Monday.
According to hospital records, a police officer was injured.
On the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 were injured when demonstrators tried to move to Sharif's residence.
They call for the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict on Sunday night after a meeting in the Army headquarters, "to waste time and to apply it without violence."
The communication also said: "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state."
The escalating violence has caused the military to intervene more often in the past.
The protests led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the preacher Tahirul Qadri continue since the day of independence on August 14.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers on Sunday to persevere.
"We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign," said Khan.
Qadri was similar.
Khan is accusing Sharif of winning the parliamentary election in May last year through fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government is to reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are in use to protect the government district.
The protesters had initially been peaceful in front of the Parliament until Khan and Qadri called them on the weekend to advance to Sharif's residence.

With the 2: 0 about Grote, a bitter week on Sunday has come to an end.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate stage with the off in the Europe League on Thursday.
"The success experience was extremely important," confirmed Captain and Torschütze Steffen Hofmann, who, with green-white, was in place three.
Schrammel-Traumtor brings Rapid to Siegerstraße Rapid with the second season victory has shown the right response to the disappointment against Helsinki and goes to the country game break with a success experience.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said Foreign Defender Thomas Schrammel, who, with his magnificent leadership volley from the sixteenth corner, set the course for victory in the 14th minute.
"I thought I'd go in all the fruit of Thursday and snuck it under the latte," said the 26-year-old smiling.
When Schrammel met for the last time in a federal league on November 13, 2010, this was still for Ried.
The first match in the Rapid-Dress will therefore remain in his special memory.
"For me, this is something very special, I'm from the Rapid offspring," said Schrammel.
Due to the short-term pelvic-Blassur by Mario Pavelic, Schrammel returned from the left to the right defensive side and did his thing very well there too.
He has enough experience that he can also perform this position in a mirror.
He has earned the goal, he has already done some assists this time, "said Barisic.
The team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to the 2: 0 by Hofmann after about one hour, which finally brought the decision.
The guests could have written to that.
"Thank God we have had some luck today," also noted Schrammel, who played with it on the clash of performance and result over the past few weeks: "The results have not voted, but the playful was always good compared to last year."
In fact, Barisic found that "in many games before" - against "the strongest team that played in this stadium this season."
The first three-point since July 26 has therefore proved that the team structure is in spite of the setbacks intact: "Today my team has shown that it has character."
No less gratifying for him: "That we have finally played too zero again."
The fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger several failures are to be complained of, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger make the victory even more valuable.
"You can't forget that," said Barisic, who lost in the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "who have been very stable lately."
The country play break therefore had to be used to "lick wounds and to do a little bit in the physical area," said Barisic, who has five U21 players in his series.
I think one of them who has a special place to take the break is Captain Hofmann.
He's tearing himself up for the team, going over pain.
Especially in this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us, "said Barisic.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids not only the structure but also the second goal before he changed in the 68th minute.
For the 33-year-old, who finished his 350-year-old Bundesliga game, it was the first hit out of the game since November 2, 2013 (4: 2 on the admira).
Hofmann: "May not believe that everything is good now" "We have certainly also been a little lucky, but at some point happiness must come back to us too.
Now it was high time, "said Hofmann.
He, of course, encouraged concentrated further work: "You must not always see this black and white.
We have not played as bad as it has been shown in the last few weeks.
But we must not believe that everything is good now.
He could not deny the importance of his role in the team.
It's a very young team that I can help very much right now.
They are still in a certain phase of my life, "said Hofmann.
Greatest coach Michael Baur had little to do with himself and his team.
He regretted the rapid rematch "from the category Magic Gate," as well as the regular gate of Nuz in the 40th minute, which had been unjustly rejected by referee colleagues.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we were not concrete enough to go to the gate in some phases.
We've had too few degrees.
It was similar to the interior-defender Maximilian Karner: "It started in a very bad way, but then we found it in and even made a gate.
In general, there would have been more in it.
Under this tip there is rest
We showed a powerful tribe in our mystery task of the summer series "My piece of the Rhöner Luck" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants still exist in the district, the image is the "Geischruheiche" above Unterweissenbrunn.
A wooden walk leads up to the about 600-year-old oak.
It goes past the clutch, the basalt stone heap and the basalt stone seas.
A little bit below the quarry from the Bauersberg, a kilometre north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it goes beyond the other trees of the surrounding area and is reminiscent of an American mammoth tree with a height of over eight meters.
A small Buddha on a tree stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive research, there was only evidence of the name origin.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted the Bischofsheim archive and asked older people from underknowledge to find out what the situation is with the war.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
It is therefore said that, up to about 80 years ago, the goat-heirs had their animals on the weary-roasted and stone-free meadows from underwhite brunn.
At the foot of the tree the animal keepers exhausted from the ascent must have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because on the meadows there are actually goats again.
The area has also been declared the core area of the biosphere reserve, Schneider has further found out.
When entering the stone collections, however, you should be careful, because the basalt raised by the sun is also a popular place for crusaders.
A hiking path leads from Unterweissenbrunn to the tree, which is hidden something.
Further paths are signposted, the direction of Hohrön rise and invite to an extensive hike.
Where's the water castle?
However, a water castle, which is sought in our next task, can be found in height rather rarely.
The reflection in the ditch already gives a good impression of the building, but in the district we have some historical buildings to which the building account could fit.
Where is our "piece of the Rhöner Luck"?

After a few weeks of diving, Italy's Prime Minister and President-in-Office, Matteo Renzi, has won the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as the head of EU foreign policy, and she is the successor of the British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi looks at how the government-close daily La Repubblica reflects the vocation of his Mogherini, also in the government team as a favorite, to strengthen the position of the social democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to calm down the ever-increasing left-wing party base against him, for Mogherini is assigned to it - though rather in a moderate way.
As regards the conservative representative with the President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Tusk, said, the dominant opinion in Rome, so that a political balance could be achieved.
The EU's head diplomat will at the same time become the deputy President of the Commission, Juncker.
The EU Parliament's still outstanding approval is considered to be safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would have hardly called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) a "important recognition" of the role of Italy in the EU.
La Repubblica is spreading optimism that the Mogherini, known for its ambition, which has been in the leading political offices for almost two decades, will be able to meet the "enormous challenges."
The native Roman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began in 1996 in the youth organisation of the then Democratic Party of Sinistra (left-wing Democrats), which joined the Catholic central party Margherita in 2008 as the current Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Youth) for three years.
With the 2001 election to the Left Democrats' Party Council, she entered the high party policy, working in the foreign policy department, whose head she soon became.
It has occupied traditional priorities of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, has been known through studies on NATO operations in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a troop account, and has maintained contacts with the social democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the US.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Representatives, in which she is an expert in defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became the Prime Minister in February 2014, he called Mogherini to his Foreign Minister.
If today the PD has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the more than 40% vote of the party in the EU elections in May, then, as is noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a share of it.
The presidencies in Brussels, the new EU external agent has too little diplomatic experience, so if there is no substance, the PD will account for it.
In Brussels, particularly by Poland and the Baltic members, the "Russian-friendly" course is being used to pursue a mistrust of realistic accents of Mogherini to the crisis in Ukraine.
It supports the pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe under the bypass of Ukraine, which also serves the energy security of Italy.
After Renzi took office as EU President in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow for her first state visit.
The photos they showed with Putin at the shake-hands were taken with indignation in Brussels, as well as inviting the Kremlin leader to a Milan Economic Summit for October.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an azubi, which has already completed a different training in the company.
The new employees will be active in four training occupations: electronics (three trainees), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All the azubis come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vom Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfreie and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees previously visited primary and secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all the years as well as the trainers are going to a team training event to Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day migration and rafting on the Inn are on the program.
The company has 435 employees across Germany and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of trainees distributed over all the years is 27.
The Socialists in France should "shut up and fix France," said the most important ally of Francois Hollande.
Mr Valls called on the deep-split left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist president whose cabinet reformation has come up against disapproval by the large majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay with him," he said with great applause.
As a worrying gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France, despite strong demands for a relaxation of the regime by Emmanuel Macrons, the new economic ministers.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande had urged his fellow Socialists to "join" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, sprang sand into the gearbox in which she appeared at a meeting of a disrepute socialist MEP and criticised the Socialist Party for taking the French "faith in her future."
Marine Le Pen, the very right-wing leader of the National Front, was mocking the permanent trenches of the Socialists and said that she could not imagine that the new Vall's government would last for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has no, they are forced to form a new government if the old one has not even survived a summer.
"And the new one will also not survive autumn or winter," said Miss Le Pen to supporters.
She repeated her party's call for a resolution of Parliament and said that she was confident that she would come out as a winner in the early elections and be ready for the government.
The ruling party of France suffered a defeat in the local elections in March and the right-wing national front was ahead of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dianchen showed that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is in danger of falling into several rival groups before the end of the Hollanden term of office in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not improve the economy and record unemployment.
"There is a small window for possibilities, but public opinion must feel fast that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could further deteriorate.
Norwegian Cruise just before a deal with Prestige Cruises of 3 billion
According to the industry, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise provider in the world, is leading advanced negotiations for the acquisition of the competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and its wealthy customers, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced this week, said the sources on Sunday and warned that the talks could end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also has a 20% share in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous because the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a speaker for Apollo rejected a comment.
The company Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, acts under the brand names Oceania and Regent, who jointly operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry is about $29 billion in total, and in the next few years it is expected to be expected for it due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging markets such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice among the cruise providers for these new customers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the US regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo is the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino company under the control of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
In January 2013, Norwegian Cruise went to the stock exchange.
Genting held 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of the shares, and the private equity company TPG Capital LP held an 8 percent share in the company at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise have 82 percent of the passenger capacity on American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for Prestige Cruises.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A peking-faithful group waved near the Chinese flag.
The permanent committee of the National People's Congress adopted a framework law on Sunday, which only allows two or three candidates for the Hong Kong leadership election in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be filled with peking-faithful members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to be admitted to the election and has led pro-democracy activists to face up to their threat and to put the Hong Kong financial square down with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong, and China's party leadership is afraid that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
After the publication of a Beijing White Paper, which set out China's dominance over Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral procedure in the Special Administrative Region, where hundreds of thousands of people marched into the city's business district and organised a sit-in there.
Li's survey is organised by the Hong Kong Government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-President of the Legal Commission of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun and the Vice-Director of the Hong Kong Affairs Office and Macaus of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be consulted during the day.
Student activists announced that they would meet in the afternoon in front of the top office in Hong Kong.
The United Kingdom did not have any democratic elements until the final phase of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to take up "state talks" with the East Ukraine
According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russian media reports requested on Sunday that the Ukrainian government set up the fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and start immediately with negotiations on the "state" of the renegade region.
His spokesman, Dimitri Peskov, later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the area of eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become a part of Russia, but that his status towards Ukraine had to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
However, Putin's call to the Kiev Government for negotiations on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents is in line with the strategy he has apparently pursued since the start of the exodus five months ago: help for the separatists in the oral of territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government to enable the newly proclaimed region of Novorosija to become an alliance with Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the state television channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to take back the separatists' territories in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the area taken as "Novorossija" or "Neurusland," a term that reminds of the pre-revolutionary glare of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who are "caught in their illusions" in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on 26 Oct. and while government groups are attacking civil communities in the areas of separatists, were hoping for early peace talks, reported Itar-Tass.
"We must immediately start extensive discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of South-East Ukraine, in order to protect the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to the state must be seen in the context of the greater autonomy that has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership in order to spread fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the Eastern territories the necessary autonomy, said Peskov.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kremlspeller to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin's comments underlined Russia's leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants of ethnic Russians are.
Moscow would have far greater difficulties in annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls from the time before the conflict gave a large majority for the stay in Ukraine.
The autonomy referred to by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, thus giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area that connects the Russian territory to Crimea.
The peninsula in the Black Sea, which was annexed five months ago, is the home port for most of the Russian Navy, as well as an important commercial port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
In his speech on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that the Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - should consider additions to the Constitution, giving the respective areas greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels whose arms and incitement are being accused of Moscow.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on an eye-level basis followed a further advance of the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks entered the eastern Ukraine through the previously peaceful region along the Azoan Sea.
The separatists supported by Russia took over the control of Novoazovsk, which, according to Ukrainian security officials, is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations have been launched to strengthen Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants, between Novoazovsk and the narrow access to the Crimea peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and asked for urgent action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are about to see a point where there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not take concrete action, and the leadership called for further sanctions against Russia to enter into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tank colonies and 1,000 soldiers passed into the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesperson of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council on Saturday in Kiev.
The first 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who were included in the Russian invasion of Ilowajsk, were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian parachutes who had been captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko reported on Sunday.
Nude photo scandal around Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten did not make a cry about his trouble about hackers who probably stole nude pictures of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and who is who the A-celebrities from Hollywood.
The film city is in excitement after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence have appeared in a hacking scandal around celebrities on the Internet.
The hacker, who is responsible for this, probably has 60 naked photos of Lawrence, star of "the Tribute of Panem" and superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and the actress Kirsten Dunst.
The Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne were also supposed to be private photos due to an iCloud gap.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
The most noble who had engaged to Grecko last month said to Confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reported on a news page that the hack was "shameful" and that the people were "hurt."
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two pictures in which she is at the top without in a pool.
The film works of Palmer include "Love is invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the hacked pictures.
A representative Lawrence 'said to TMZ, "It is an abominable violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "To post hacked pictures from a mobile phone is nothing but the sale of hehlerware."
In purely legal terms, the dissemination of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radler, jogger and hikers were there yesterday at 8. Cycling on the Great Feldberg and thus supported the association "Help for cancer children."
The tour, which was a torture for one, was an easy training for the other.
In one, however, everyone agreed: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski must have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberurseler Brauhaus took the wheel to the Feldberg yesterday.
For the good.
He can easily put away the small muscle centre, especially as the participation in the 8. Cycling on the Great Feldberg in favour of the association "Help for cancer children" (Frankfurt) has also personally brought him a valuable knowledge.
It's a great thing.
"I know now that I can do this - fine!"
Little pimp on the way in the appla curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been over...
Like Thomas Studanski, who is sitting for the CDU in the Oberurseler Stadtparlament, many of the 718 participants yesterday in the early tau tormented to mountains and came close to exhaustion, but happy on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, were easier to overcome the 11 km long line between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Diessner, for example.
The Green politician from the Kreisdag, who was born in red - red dress, red bike - did something at the start on understatement ("A lot of professionals, there is the target!"), but then on the mountain proved to be half a professional and went through the goal after 45 minutes without a need for breath.
He also went through the track in a slide, as did Nina Kuhn, the press speaker of the city of Oberursel, who had set off together with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about Charity, we are happy to be there - we would have made an exit today anyway," said Kuhn.
On the way they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning to get back to the height.
The Frankfurter Florian Sierz had swung into the saddle at 9: 00 in the morning, "made" the Feldberg twice, then to roll home with fun.
He also had fun with "Fritten-Toni."
For the head of the Oberurseler Kultkiosk bike tours over the Feldberg are just part of it.
He had a 6-kilo racing wheel on him for 40 minutes.
It's a crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to be there, "said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says of himself that he is an "ambitious racing cyclist."
He must be, because he was on the road with the "fixie wheel," which is also racing wheels, but without a circuit...
The 20 hikers who went up over the White Wall and the Fuchstanz to the summit, but also a jogger, who pulled a car tire with weights on a cord, proved that it was easy to go up.
Bergwat doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who was with his team, equipped with Allrad-Bully and Quad, for safety, said: "I know him from Frankfurt, who is training for a special slitting track, only that he is pulling the sled himself." So the man is his own slitting dog.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as never - were sent on the route in the morning in groups.
The hikers first at 9.30.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10: 00.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers set off.
Bent Hansen, Chairman of the Association "Cycling on the Great Feldberg," gave the start commandos and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year he hopes that the route to the Feldberg will be able to lock up to the security of the participants.
