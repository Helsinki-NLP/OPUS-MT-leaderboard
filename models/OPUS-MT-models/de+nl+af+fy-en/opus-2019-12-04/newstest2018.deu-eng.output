Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A madhouse where young people are supposed to meet today.
A tomb chapel, where the S-Bahn tunnel is now being dug.
Small gardeners manage the former reason of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to day.
It's annoying when maps are not up-to-date.
Everyone knows this because the car-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.
The historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlas, an offer of the Geopotal Bayern of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but this is precisely why it is very informative.
Especially if you compare them to current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the distribution area of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern Atlas is a patchwork that is not recognized as such.
More detailed maps, so-called "Urpositionblatt," were added to the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
According to the Bayerische Vermeerstungsverwaltung between 1810 and 1864, these were created and the first measurement of Bayerns was made.
Your client, Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville of 9 February 1801: It was today's neighbours who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian map.
Kurfürst Max IV Joseph continued the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bayerische Vermeerstungsverwaltung.
The original paper for Munich dates from 1856 and can be found like all others on the website of the Bavarian National Library.
The comparison before / today is the most impressive example of the capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is the sender, which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. in 1877, as Munich's district.
It is located in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendlings are located around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserstraße, which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears at the zoom in: hand-written numbered flurries from the so-called "first-view," from which the property tax was derived.
Small parcels are no longer showing farmers there - but small gardeners of the "land in the sun" plant.
A large green area is located north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the site of the Oktoberfest, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the original paper you can read not only the street name "am Gasteig" in the area of today's district of Au-Haidhausen or from the height "On the Ventilation" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."
Yeah, here on the Auerfeldstraße, people were once locked up with delusions.
In 1858 / 59 the Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüften" was created.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - that psychiatrist, who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the anaesthetic of the so-called madmen.
He has also forbidden the staff to apply violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum of Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.
For 280 patients there had been first room, later it was extended to 500 places.
At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905.
The Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been there since 2006.
On the area of the former Auer Anstalt now meet young people in the Munich Salesianum.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training companies.
Westlich is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east residential houses from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in an architectural approach to the original construction of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during the Second World War in the event of a bomb attack.
The Marienplatz was listed as "Hauptplatz" around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse."
The Second World War also brought a decisive change to the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombings in December 1944 tore many holes into the city centre.
A large one remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a Middle Ages tomb chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where these days are the preparatory work and on April 5, 2017 the spatenstich for the second S-Bahn line.
With the slider the old Munich card can be compared to the air image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.
Citizens' Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colorful People has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and the racist attacks of the state.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is due to enter into force until 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travellers, visitors and missouans to pay particular attention to travel through the state and to have extreme caution, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents have recently occurred in the whole state and are noted here," says the Group's opinion.
A recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination complaints, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state, which are disproportionately aimed at minorities, led the group to issue the travel warning, said NAACP.
"They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed, "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard."
It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the US.
The group quoted incidents like racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no gas in the state during his journey and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The Council also draws attention to a recent report by the Missouri State Attorney General's Office, which shows that black drivers in the state are stopped 75% more frequently than white.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be ready whether it brings bail money or let the relatives know that they are travelling through the state."
In 2015, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting programme, which classified the state as the 16th rank in terms of the number of such injuries.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Before that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Weidezaunproject is elemental
The Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year.
The CDU members Peter White and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on site.
The legal court of the Schwendemann family met representatives of the fisher's CDU local association together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.
Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his farm, where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, provides 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and houses holiday guests in five apartments.
The "Black Forest Milk" is for him the alternative way of marketing for the milk of his cows, according to Schwendemann.
On the table of the guests comes only regional.
Since he is also the president of the BLHV of Fischbach, he called the Weidezaunproject "essential."
I cannot be profitable on such steep areas.
The green land area provides a lot of work, much has to be done with the engine sense.
"We have to fight here with the conditions and the topography," said Schwendemann.
In 2003, he took over the parent farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not run a bioholding.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the grazing project and is happy with the Leader promotion."
At the cost of between EUR 3000 and 4000 per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that the afforestation of the areas could be extended for a long time.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how they will continue their business," the mayor stressed.
Farmers are often criticised for their support.
In 2013, a total of 25 plots of 11 participants were fenced through the grazing ground.
The area of the open area is thus 40 hectares, which must not be harnessed by at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was supported by Leader, a quarter of which was carried by the municipality of Fischbach.
Thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 km of pasture.
"The great advantage is the longevity of fences," said Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac said, "You are doing a really good job, without farmers and rural women."
For Peter Weiß it was also clear: "Here the best food is produced."
The Landschaftspflegline (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows for the state support of grazing fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
The existence of a support course referred to by the LPR is a prerequisite.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be sufficiently manageable (slope over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
For the Scherbacher Weidezaunproject 2018, the application is currently being made by eight participants with 24 plots, who want to build just under 16 km of fence.
The area of openness is 35 hectares and the calculated cost is more than EUR 112 000.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of a regime change is when they start to attack the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein on the Firdo Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a hot fight with Jim Acosta of CNN on the President's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.
To stay fair, Miller didn't attack the statue himself.
A bunch of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have lynched him if he did.
But he attacked their meaning, and in particular the meaning attributed to her when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to his base.
When Miller Acosta complained, "I don't want to go into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.
The poem to which you refer, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
Miller is in fact right, but as he himself said, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary response to Lazarus's stirring words, the only one in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tides, your poor, / your troubled masses who desire to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "miserable waste" on our screens was better seen.
Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends, who were committed to putting their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they were doing a highly political act.
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical picture.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: Mother of the Exilants.
The connection of the poem to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change this from the right wing for a long time.
The great Shriehal Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone, but rather is an early neo-conservative that brings the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not illuminate the way to the United States. "
It's quite unusual that Limbaugh has come up with something here.
The importance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see it as it was seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It is, in the truth, about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the will that they must hear.
And, of course, that's not the perspective Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.
Their torch shall not light the way, but shall ignite the hatred which is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the team of Great Britain
Eilith Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the team of Great Britain
The United Kingdom's performance director, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish quota will "make a massive contribution to the team in the world framework."
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and that the UK's athletics must learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," said Black.
"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they've done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy at the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant. "
Several of the Scottish athletes are medallion candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eiligh Doyle was elected team captain by the team.
"Eiliith is quite modest.
Your captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eiliith brought in naturally was great. "
The Commonwealth Silver Medal winner, who will be in the 400 m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says that it is "incredible" that 16 bulkheads are in the British team.
Scotland's best total number of athletes in the world championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.
The Müir medium-range runner is on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 metres, is another Scot that was to be observed after a great season, which included the victory of the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says that she is "extremely proud" of the fact that many of her countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my team colleagues voted for me and chose me, it makes something very special for me," she added.
"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to get on stage.
As for my speech as captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship.
So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it'll just be such a great atmosphere out there. "
Blocking critics on Facebook: Do not apply for a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything, from internal politics to his political principles.
He was in the middle of the criticism, I'm sure.
But he didn't silence his critics.
For in 1783 Washington said: "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and stupid, we are led to slaughter like the sheep."
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
And that's why the American Civil Liberation Union sued him at the beginning of this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as a matter of time, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Well, so?."
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it's important.
And it's particularly important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is surprisingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict respect for the principles.
He was also very skilful in using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his voters and playing his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum that is officially referred to as and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's speaker Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that the blocking of the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people who are swinging the whip online.
The mail spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, not a troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not pro.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani von Bowie, MD, was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comment area of the news "The Post."
"I do not appreciate this idea either, if a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are disrespected by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and not recognised as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor's staff called "concentrated spam attack" would probably call others "intercession."
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles or arrest protesters and silence them.
But that's what's happening digitally right now.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for disgraced Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on this issue fell in Virginia last week.
The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County injured the first amendment, according to U.S. district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable port had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter-writers came to his lead.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius," wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions, which criticised his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with the United Kingdom, overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington project.
But he didn't silence her.
Freedom of speech, differences of opinion and discourses are the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for home comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordic, which last year led to the end of the Archerfield Left before losing to Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi.
"I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built, and we see him achieve his glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great condition.
Jerry did a great job fixing this place.
He is an eager advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great window for this course. "
The English Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he won in his 32-year career both on the European Tour and on the European Challenge Tour.
"That really feels special," said the player who was born in Southport.
"I have not been able to defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magic.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year are coming back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate. "
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to the action on home floor.
This event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do well, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I'm glad to see how it went. "
The trio in the field is the former master winner Ian Woosemam and the senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six bulkheads in the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free, the parking costs £5 per car with an occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.
All proceeds go to Prostate Cancer UK.
Less lung cancer due to passive smoking
Over the past two decades, less and less people have died of lung cancer because of passive smoking.
To this result, scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come in a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking," said study director Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994.
At that time, there were 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new investigation is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections are very complex
The construction works on Villinger Street are in full swing and "are somewhat in time," said the head of the building of Fred Heinze.
In the area of home connections, the situation was more complicated than was suspected, as there was much hiding in the underground, which was not mentioned in the plans.
The traffic, which is constantly obstructing the construction work, is a major problem for the construction of the Stump company.
"The ignorance of the drivers in the face of red traffic lights and barricades is already enormous," says Heinze.
The road was closed and only the line buses were allowed to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stump have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days have been quite exhausting.
But fortunately, our friend Fritz Matt provided us with cool mineral water, "says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian Goldland
If Bardina Degei makes dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She only rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regency in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potato - locally called "note" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the coiled tubers are taken from and swallowed with icy, unwashed hands.
Degei is sitting on the mound - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, for example to wash clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a homeless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, late work can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5: 00," she says.
It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote in front of the occupying forces by a public survey.
An existing movement in favour of independence against the Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part Papua-New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is ode. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the province capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a 5-hour drive by car tomorrow.
There is no public transport.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and of corrugated roofs, which have been converted into different yellow-brown tones by rust.
Only very few Indonesia have made their journey here, let alone journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god called Uga Tamee.
There have also been other changes.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, pointing to her lively, hand-woven turban, her dark shirt and her bright skirt.
"We used to have only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's Goldland.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a high-land province of New Jersey with a population of 153,000.
In 2015 alone, Freeport has reduced gold and copper at the value of $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua has wood resources worth $78 billion.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papua, which ensure that Indonesia's powerful military keeps an suffocating presence.
A 2005 investigation in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military members and units almost 20 million dollars between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970's became genocide in accordance with the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
"We will lose everything" is said in a report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane from 2016, which contains reports of atrocities of the previous year, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have increased as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing, as Muslim economic migrants come from the population-rich islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Warung canteens sell fried chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to keep up with this.
"The migrants have started to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," says Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the province capital Jayapura.
"It has cost the native Papua - the mother of Papua - their market."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi in the popular language, promised to address the inequalities and legal violations in Papua during his 2014 campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua little has changed, and today the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will meet our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, Paniai suffered a low point only two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the dark on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took an attack on their tone and later came back with four soldiers, according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had been drinking were hunting and beating the group with their guns, saying victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting arches and performed the Waita dance - in a circle and imitating a bird song - of Papuas Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began to throw stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, a command was sent to the soldiers on an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they will shoot them dead," says an official document by TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home.
No one was listening in the mood.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he said TIME on the porch of his colorful wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overcrowded, many shots were fired," he added.
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, so his cousin, who was a witness to the shooting.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesian people, has only one name, the TIME in a dark mood.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
The chief inspector of the Papua police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because they were attacked.
"We have to defend ourselves when people are threatening to kill us," said the Papua police spokesman, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more were injured.
The news about the killings came to Jakarta only the following day.
Jokowi made a passionate speech in Jayapura for three weeks in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to address the historical maladministration in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately, so that it won't happen again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an out-of-court mechanism to resolve historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to dealing with these violations, but there are processes that need to be carried out, "he said.
Then Wiranto withdrew when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on 5 June and said he did not have any plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, whom the UN has accused of "crimes against humanity," which required more than 1,000 victims of death in East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations have already been resolved in Papua, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with grudgingly insinuations.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid to be arrested by the military, I'm afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military was looking for me," he says.
The shootings didn't stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniai's neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man who was 24-year-old Ravianus Duw, who was drowned when he was fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Revered villagers protested in front of the company's location office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panicked, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and was a witness to how the injured people were quickly admitted here, says the TIME.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for the withdrawal of the police 'mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai was always a troublemaker for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribe-related Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army, who claims to defend the rights of Papua by attacking sporadic attacks and abductions of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai in recent years and have been detained arbitrarily, under the pretext of "securing national sovereignty."
Some never show up again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for local people.
Bread's just as out of range.
The people here are building everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can each handle four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between the local Papua and the new migrants have grown, which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better-trained and more prosperous migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to lead their own companies in a competitive way.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Tribal Council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
Moreover, restrictions on reporting of international media remain tense.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, although they were given rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi's campaign to lift the reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report from Indonesia's most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to examine the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's allegations and said to journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia, a democratic system is still in place, and there is free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, local people broke their silence and forced him to "We want freedom," according to a source that also took part in the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say that they will probably not vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, see their voice for Jokowi as a "debt" that he has to pay back.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai victims carried out a last symbolic act of pride: the body of a victim was buried on an area just opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with his head cut.
"What else can we do?"
Fire capture the 'Torch' skyscraper of Dubai for the second time
A fire on Friday in one of the world's highest residential towers in Dubai found its ledger and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337-metre-high, 79-storey building.
It is the second fire that in just two years will be swept through the high-rise building, which is by chance called the Torch Tower (Torch Tower).
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We were asleep and we got up by the fire alarm and the people's screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor, "said a resident who named his name as George Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said that the fire control units were extinguishing the fire and cooling the building around 4: 00 (00.00 GMT) local time.
The government said it was working on providing accommodation for those concerned.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 showed that most of the damage came from the clothing, the outdoor clothing to the decoration or insulation.
In the UK, the police said that they believe that the system of plates for insulation and clothing at the London Grenfell tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup Reform: Continue Best-of-Five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has failed with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho-Chi-Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup singles only on two sets of profits was not supported by the necessary two-thirds majority.
The five-set classics that are often very long, but also very well-appreciated, are thus preserved by the traditional application.
63.54% of the Member States voted in favour of the reform, and the objective of ITF President David Haggerty was therefore very little missed.
"We respect this decision, but we are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions, "said Haggerty.
They will continue to work to improve the application.
After many objections, the proposal to run the final in a neutral place had not come before the vote.
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details: In future, the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have host rights in the following year in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements on training places, etc., will be facilitated and the players will have to make less official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring prohibited objects to the plane, find out a survey
A survey of air passengers showed that more than 20 percent of objects deliberately or unconsciously prohibited were smuggled past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent that entered the aircraft while they were carrying accidentally prohibited knives or other objects with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they had discovered late that they had been misguided by weapons, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travellers are rather disrespecting the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something that was forbidden by TSA, 19.7 percent were millennia, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of generation X.
The most common items that were deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted that they knowingly carried objects with blades through security control, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately taken banned drugs on the plane.
The company said that it had asked travellers all over the country to find out how many accidentally smuggled goods had been brought through airport security and how many would have done it intentionally.
It is no surprise that the people who carry the most smuggling goods - knowingly or unknowingly - through the security were the ones who fly the most.
However, the company points out that the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure which liquids they can take with them or how much of them.
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of the objects seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA could look at books as smuggling goods.
liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Elektro-thousand sassa Elon Musk likes to give the huge number of reservations for his new Tesla "Model 3."
He has so far prevented some of the customers from withdrawing their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-triumphant figures on sales increases and even more huge sales targets, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has for the first time announced the latest quarterly balance sheet a different, less shiny number: those of the cancellations in the new mass market model 3.
In recent months, Musk has often promoted more than 500,000 reservations for the new car, the delivery of which is just beginning.
Now Musk acknowledges: Of the total 518,000 reservations 63,000 have been withdrawn again.
Critics had repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will pay back the EUR 1000 (in the US $1000 and in the UK £1000) "reservation deposit."
At the moment there were 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk admitted to a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of around 12 percent of all orders to date could become a problem.
His argument: the challenge of the ambitious growth targets is not demand but production.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84.000 vehicles.
In 2018, all models together will be 500,000, a million in 2020.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
If you order a "model 3" today, you can expect to be delivered at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive his brand new production roads, which have never been tested in practice, without any major interruptions with maximum capacity utilisation.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are more delays, the inconsistency of the reservations could become the problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in a crowd.
EPO Chief Pruitt is withdrawing due to the delay in Obama's Era rules to reduce emissions
One day after he was sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the environmental authority, took back his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the public environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the action brought against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.
It is a deadline which expired on 1 October for States to comply with the 2015 standards for soil-near ozone.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time, study the plan and avoid "interfering in local decisions or impede economic growth."
Pruitt, who was the prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of more stringent environmental legislation.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly been able to block or delay regulations that are opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeal court in Washington decided that the EPO administrator exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration, which required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed that its turn-back on ozone standards would simply increase the EPO's willingness to cooperate with States through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"In previous administrations, the EPO has often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation and has then been waiting to be charged by activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," said Pruitt, who sued the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and authority that exists to us. "
However, the EPO's opinion said that Pruitt will at some point use its "power to delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules "are based on sound policy and the best available information."
The Republicans in Congress are pressing for a more comprehensive review of the ozone rules.
A draft law adopted last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
The New York Attorney General Eric Schneider, who led the coalition of the states that had sued the EPO this week, said that the group intended to maintain the legal pressure.
"The reverse of the EPO - according to our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and those over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," said Schneider.
In this case, New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone is created when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere respond to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths.
Representatives of public health and the environmentalists were cheering about Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It is worrying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air that we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the ideological crusade of the Trump government to offer itself to polluters and their particular interests."
Tumblingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, a serenade is invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July at 4: 30 p.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
The visitors of the sixth Benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the place have made the friends and supporters of Tumlingens their concern.
Walter Martini points out, "It is a unique local little od."
In 1267, the St. Hilarius chapel was first mentioned in the German book of documents: Count Hermann of Sulz "sold the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.
According to the text of the document on the Tumlinger Berg, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a magnificent court, to which the church or the right of patronate belonged and not the other way around.
So there were people there, too.
As the description of the "Oberamte Freudenstadt" of 1858 shows, next to the "Unterdorf" and the "Oberdorf" which are still visible in the village of Tumlingen today, the "mountain" was the third, the dominant settlement center of the village.
Old maps from around the year 1600 support these historical circumstances.
The right to patronate was created from the early medieval own church law.
A Lord who built a church, exhibited and occupied with a priest, remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this own church.
The right to set up a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop was associated with this.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two is broken on Christmas 1673.
The newly acquired bell was first published in 1692, but had to be delivered later in World War II in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616-1648) the windows were struck and the bell lines were stolen.
The roof was closed.
In 1796, French troops encamped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
The remains of the church were threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius Church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
In the New Year's night of 1834 a storm split the church tower and half of it collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was demolished.
Only the current tower wreaths were preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old history of the Church.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Schaffigen Pensioners" as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius plant.
As an organizer, the friends and supporters of Tumlingens invite on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade to the old cemetery to the St. Hilarius chapel.
It is designed by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
The programme will start at 4.30 p.m.
The entrance is from 3: 30.
To the end of the serenade there is a drink in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest," the organizers show the fantastic view.
The serenade only takes place in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to maintain the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is important for tulls and hearing swimmers.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organiser Walter Martini confirms.
Association wants to have approval of wind wheels checked
"Boisheim resists" does not see a legal condition for the construction and has therefore turned to the Councillor.
The association "Boisheim resists" has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette.
It was illegal.
The association argues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016 no wind power plants could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette, since at that time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the city border to Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind power plants are in principle possible, but at the same time the concentration zone is excluded from the use of wind energy for the rest of the city.
These zones are intended to prevent the "sparing" of the landscape.
The city of Viersen had decided a second wind-power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette by a change of the land use plan a few days ago - but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a formality.
"As a result of the lack of planning legal condition, the authorisation decision granted is still illegal and therefore also withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim resists."
Current state of play: The City Council once again decided before the summer break the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; an approval of the district government is still pending.
In this regard, it is not possible to grant an authorisation to set up wind turbines.
The circle confirms the receipt of the call.
"The corresponding letters have been received by the district of Viersen for the past week," a speaker said.
The circle takes them as an occasion to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not likely to lead to a stop to the procedure.
With a view to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, the circle did not want to comment on the content of the argument of the association "Boisheim warns."
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four and 200 metres of wind wheels on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
Last year, the company in which the city of Viersen is involved had already concluded lease contracts with the owner of the area of about 65 hectares.
The four wind turbines will be able to meet the electricity needs of around 11 400 households - about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four households.
The NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersens City Council gave green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind park near Aachen and a participation in a wind power plant in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and tractor crash together: woman dies in a terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning around 10: 00 on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was killed.
Two more people were slightly injured.
The state road was closed for hours.
According to police reports, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich with her car in the course of the guided driving with her 53-year-old mother as an accompanying person is driving the L 333 towards Bogel.
City and traders plan "Home Shopping" weekend
Bad Langensalzaar and people from the region are to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to attract the residents to the city centre.
As the chairman of the Trade Association, Christian König, announced, the "Home-Shopping" weekend is intended to raise customers' awareness of what offers their own city has to offer away from the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market, is therefore planned.
In addition, local companies should present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city centre are to invite to "midnight shopping."
The project is not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearby region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, according to Christian König.
The city administration and the trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
The trade association and the city thus go into another stage of the project "Attractive city centre."
These include new offers such as the first "active day" for the well-being, including the sale of Sunday, talks with all traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the waiver of parking charges on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential is to be reopened or reopened.
These include spa guests and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost sight of the city centre when shopping.
In the end, everyone should help to revive the city centre - up to landlords, the companies of the whole city and associations.
With a network, it was necessary to overcome the lethargy, which had partly spread, king said in the spring.
Birgit Greich, head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen, announced that on the third "home-shopping" day in Germany, five Thuringia cities will participate for the first time.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities," says Strich.
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his own purchasing behaviour can influence his own direct environment.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, two people have been killed and nine more have been injured, some of them difficult.
According to the fire department, on Wednesday (local time) there was another injured person in critical condition.
A person died when part of a school building collapsed during the explosion.
A first missing person was later also found dead.
The dead were employees of the school.
As an accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
At the time of the holiday, only a few people stayed in the building of the Minnehaha Academy.
Trump put pressure on Mexico after leaked transcripts of phone calls because of the payment of the border wall
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called on the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US President disgraced him because he had publicly denounced the wall. According to reports, he said to him, "You can't tell the press that."
Trump started his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States, and swore to have Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the United States to take over refugees who emigrated to Australia was "ridiculous," "bad" and "stupid" and that the existence of the trade that was mediated by the Obama government would make him look like a "dump" after he proposed a ban on the relocation of refugees to the United States.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he said to Mr. Turnbull, "This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moors Ford-Massacre: Activists re-establish racist Lynchakt as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in the rural Monroe, Georgia, and rattled at the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns came out to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle stripe suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked through the windshield.
The inmates were in fear.
"We want this n -- r Roger!" the man roared.
"Get him out of the car!"
Scream tore the silence when a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene that was played on July 22 is just a replay.
But when a sling is thrown around the neck of Roger, almost all of the people in the audience were very real sigh.
Since 2005, civil rights have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one was ever charged with the murders.
"It is really incredible that no one has been arrested in all these years - even though we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps in the organization of the recovery.
"It's a dirt spot on a story, but it's a burden to our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the state of Georgia and a civil rights officer for life.
For him, the provision serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want law enforcement, we want the end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need justice," he said.
"We can't get to cure and reconciliation until we get justice."
A medical examiner puts a bed towel on the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford Lynch on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files received from the NBC News, more than 50 Monroe men and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch process.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects have been on the loose for decades, citizens say that the double motivation for Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court made it possible for the black citizens of Georgia to vote in the pre-election campaign in the summer for the first time.
About the same time as the election, according to the FBI, the black farmer Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was wearing was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, says the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when they got away from the prison and approached the Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution, which was not only involved in the murders, removed evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses."
Brooks makes it even more concise.
"It was a right-to-vote massacre," he said.
"You were all killed to send a message to black people in this community:" If you let yourself be registered and if you vote, then this will happen to you. "
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual reparation of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch-Korden.
Their representation is illustrative, striking and is based in a kind of deep racism, of which many want to believe that it no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and it's even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about lynching, because then we're confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't establish a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
The samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of the black ones - pressed into a room and listened when Greene started a well-recorded overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is the Green Co-director here.
He has played the role of the Chief Clanmember for years, but he said that the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like this," said Marmaugh.
"But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The play starts with Malcom, who yells at Hester and pushes him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n -- he, get away from my property!"
Rascona will return the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Green laughs the loudest.
"What?!," asked Rascona.
He's alert and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still giggling.
"I just don't think white people said" he "back then."
"Yes," wept one of the other black actors.
"All you have to do is meet the hard R."
And that's where the energy in space is shifting, a sense of cameraderie is replacing the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharp and emphatically.
No one's laughing at all.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman dressed with a dream dress is above the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holiday's grieving lobroad "Strange Fruit."
Your voice breaks at every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple from Ithaca, New York, arrived to see the performance, many just come down the street.
They have experienced all of Georgia's pressing moisture for almost eight hours when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you're standing on the same land where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels a little spicy.
When the last notes of the song sound out, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body name.
Children stick to their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"You're not really dead," a little boy mutters like he wants to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw the Lynch rope away and wipe their tears off.
Bradshaw embraces Martaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in her arms crying, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know it's not in your heart.
You did this for a reason. "
Later, the audience is meeting with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta is talking about a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski fought to find words that left the performance.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and actions... coming from people who look like yourself and who do that because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me makes me believe that Lynch is still going on," she added, "today it's called police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks' court holds his table, he eats and recalls the civil rights.
He said he's already started planning the performance next year.
"The recovery is in a way inspiring, because it describes the horror of what we have suffered, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's like if we don't learn anything from it, it can happen again.
He who does not study his own story, who does not know his own story, is condemned to repeat it. "
"Dusk of the gods" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf is also working on a colorful-frivolous production in front of huge, six-story scenes.
The turntable (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows an optionally shady street corner, including the rest of the wall and the dönerbude in Berlin, a "plaste and elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes-Oldtimer park in which the Rhindoths pose as rocker girls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels remind of Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - that is going through his "ring" production.
The three Rhine Daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - are wonderful to harmonise as already in the "Rheingold."
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), tears a body into the trunk in Hollywood-Manier and gives the Krawallo-Clique.
Stephen Milling sings the beautiful, nasty hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavy weight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he kills Siegfried.
Later on, Gunther (Markus Eiche) has to believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
It is the first time that Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski have been in a stormy celebration, and they have been forging their hands to the Merkel Rute.
There is great applause for the festival orchestra, which is shown for the first time on stage - given the great heat again in empty leisure clothes.
The performance was expected with excitement by Frank Castorf and his management team.
In 2013 he had to have had a brilliant pipe concert about him, five years later there were great cheers in which the single "boo" calls went down.
Festspielchefin Katharina Wagner may have been happy about it.
"It is noted that the audience has grown up with the" ring "in a way," she said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience has not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but has also grown an understanding of its view.
I'm going to make a positive move.
Max Fang works as a volunteer
They work in a number of places in their volunteer year.
Where anywhere?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greben in the furniture bridge.
And I've been working at school all day open.
How are your experiences with this?
Quantity: It is a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I'm dealing with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You're 26 years old now, so you're a late-school volunteer.
How come?
I've been doing a little bit of an abitur.
And then a construction engineering study, let's say, successfully broken down.
I realized for myself that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else, work with people.
And then I was wondering what you're doing.
Do a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it really is on the spot, perhaps at the focus.
And was it?
Quantity: I've collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in the social sector in the winter semester.
I'm going to study dual, probably do a social worker training in the youth centre of Herne and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Isn't it a little unusual to have several different locations during the voluntary service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
I guess it always depends on where you make your FSJ.
One can do it from home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also partly in the OGS, that is, in the afternoon care.
For me, it was just the right thing to do.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works.
Different from the engineering school?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating statistics.
You always have other people in your head who have a completely different story behind you.
Whether a refugee, or a young person who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any fear of contact?
I'm not the guy for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but that's the way life is.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revive the business
The British training group Pearson said on Friday that it would reduce another 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividends by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme is being launched to overcome the pressure that the company is facing.
The reduction in the number of jobs announced by Director-General John Fallon, mainly at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, is in addition to its previous restructuring, which has already lost 4,000 jobs.
In May, in a third cost reduction programme, Pearson announced a plan to reduce the cost by another £300 million ($394 million) to revive a business that was taken by the rapid step towards digital learning.
The company, which had sold its participation in Penguin Random House last month in the partner Bertelsmann, said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it had increased from 1% to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.
Convoy attack of Kabul: Nato soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killed a Nato soldier and injured several others, say officials.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a statement by the Nato.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians died in the Qarabagh area.
The bombing is the last act of violence that Afghanistan has committed this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
In a statement by the Nato, it says that the explosion happened on Thursday night when a common patrol with the Afghan army was "attacked" by a "man-borne improvised explosive set.
The statement says that all the injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital at the Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a great concern for NATO's troops in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian victims in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% were in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they did this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly military attack in the country since the US-led troops forced the Taliban out of power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump is weighing up to increase the number of US troops supporting military and police forces in the country.
Correspondents say that in the last few weeks, the suicide attacks in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, their policy, and in particular in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPO restores decision to delay the Smog rule to actions
The US Environment Authority has withdrawn a decision to delay the regulation of Obama's government that states are obliged to limit the emissions of smog, a day after 15 states sued the Agency for the step.
The EPO announced late on Wednesday the decision to move forward with the so-called "ozone regulations 2015" and said it would show the Agency's obligation to cooperate with States.
"We believe in the dialogue and that we are responding to our state partners," said EPO Chief Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the EPO to measure ozone emissions in a part of the country in order to determine where to make cuts in order to comply with stricter air quality standards - by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 most democratic states, together with the district of Colombia, filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
The government of President Donald Trump has tried to reduce a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that, according to Trump, is intended to boost economic growth.
However, efforts have led to the setback of the Democrats and nature conservation groups, which are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPO website says that breathing air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Council of the European Communities
In the end, the decision was clear: in two votes against, the Municipal Council of Fluorn-Wintzen decided to set up a Community area in the future retirement home.
Before the discussion there is an important information: the purchase contract for the missing part of the land is signed, Mayor Bernhard Tjaden reports.
Although it will still be until the area of the church is in the community's possession so far, there is no more planning obstacle to the project to be voted on by a private investor.
There is a debate on a common area for this.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of area for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council is in favour of providing such a common area not just as a meeting place for the inhabitants of the seniors' right to live, but open to the community.
As an example, the word from the "Strickcafé" made the round.
The decision, which was already made by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn, is being taken by means of funding.
The building is located in the redevelopment area.
The establishment of a Community area would be eligible, according to Tjaden, with 60% of 30%.
The decision-making proposal, in order to signal to the investor that in this respect they do not want to be put between their legs, provides for the conclusion that both saddle - which is linked to the environment - and pullroof - which reduces the amount of the trust and makes the construction of the economy - would be possible.
Needless to say, not only does Wilfried Sohmer think that this addition is necessary.
If it helps, it happens unanimously to the body.
The common room is not that easy.
Daniela Rauf refers to the many own buildings with which one does not make such progress, for which one is now leaning out of the window in the common room, she says, "I am difficult to do with it."
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the common area - but absolutely opposed to local participation.
It sees behind it a hidden subsidy to any wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area you do not grant a grant, but get a real equivalent value, which can be marketed in doubt, is the counter-speech.
Mr Staiger's request to split up the decision-making proposal accordingly will find three supporters.
So it remains in two votes against the original programme, which Stefan Haller summarizes: "If we make the decision that way, we will take a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure."
Collision by car: Radler is thrown on the road
When crossing the road, an 82-year-old cyclist was caught by a car on Wednesday in Garath and was seriously injured.
As the police said, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been on the road on the road to Hilden by bike at 12.20.
The senior wanted to cross the road on the Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver driving in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder went to the road, however, it did not seem to be paying attention to the intertraffic.
He came across with a car that was driving a 66-year-old Hildenin.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a rehab car.
FC Bayern Munich has to give up on David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to let the game go against Dortmund.
With personal care, FC Bayern is travelling to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the Cup winner.
The personal concerns of the German football record champion Bayern Munich are growing before the Supercup on Saturday (8.30 am / ZDF and Eurosport) at Pokalwieger Borussia Dortmund.
In the duel with the BVB, coach Carlo Ancelotti has to give up on David Alaba.
The Italian confirmed that on Friday.
In addition, the monks Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the past six test games, Ancelotti has made the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team responsible.
"We know that we are not in the best physical condition," Ancelotti said and added, "The most important point is the balance on the team.
She was not good last time. "
The 58-year-old, however, believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team will show these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently, "said Ancelotti, who expects a" difficult, intense game. "
The duel of the two German football heavyweights is taking the fans into their control.
The game is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Walking in the resin from star to star
The first "star path" is to be created in the resin.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
There is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" meets the need for information from many heart visitors, it was said.
It connects nature, science, movement and sporting performance.
The members want to draw up tables along the planned route and then inform them about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well-achievable installations in five to six places" in the upper resin.
It is possible to find St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hoheheheiss and Sieber.
The information on the tables is to be supplemented via the Internet.
This is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of the location.
Freedom of access was also a criterion.
Later, the Starpath train is to be extended by train.
"On the star path, the viewers experience a lot of knowledge, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
They also learned why stars had different colors, or why one star was more bright than another, although it is much further away.
It is also estimated in which constellation a selected star is in and when it is best to see.
The club has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg since 2014, the highest observatory in North Germany.
According to the Federal Office for Nature Protection, the location in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany.
From there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy can be seen with the naked eye.
In the University of Göttingen, there has been something similar to the planned Starship - the Planetenweg, at the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen, since 2003.
Starting in front of Gebhard's hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planet path with its stones leads up to the Hainberg and the Observatory - as well as an "alien" location in Diemarden (municipality of the same) with the planet Sedna.
The stalks with the individual planets - including the Pluto degrade to the dwarf planet at the end point - are set up exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth thus shrunk to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun exactly 75 meters away measures 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planet's path is about four kilometres.
While the light from the sun to the Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to stele with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
The march to the next fixstar, however, would last for half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were supposed to be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion, went down the hall to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organisation Super Feather-weight Champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five Pound-for-Pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I wish you good luck. "
Lomachenko is defending his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7: 00 on ESPN.
When the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko's manager Egis Klims noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect size."
"I'm a former spring weight," said Garcia.
"I went up for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to light weight.
And he has to move on light weights [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans are asking for.
Let's give them this. "
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klims asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree on a date with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) that also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans have asked for it," said Garcia, and later openly expressed themselves to fight at the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can create this kind of attention.
Whenever they're ready... "
Garcia said he would appreciate Lomachenko as "a huge fighter," and he might be taking part in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks the Triple Champion from Riverside looks "very slow, I'm sorry Mikey... you wanted the co-out."
Garcia said the focus was to show impact, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum that was building up for their own fight.
"This is the fight that must be carried out.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it, "said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.
It will be a great fight. "
Four injured after tyre space
In the case of an accident on the A7, four people were injured in part on Thursday afternoon.
After first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at around 4.30 p.m. just before the market-wide connection point, probably after a tyre space.
The car went to the right into the flaw, where it overturned and then left on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were partially severely injured in the accident.
During the first supply of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was closed to the north for about an hour, then the traffic on the left lane could be passed at the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Triple chain works better"
After 2: 2, Andre Hoffmann hopes to start the season against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defense formation will bring points to Aue.
With the first season, Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result too, if the two counter gates had not been in the 2-2 against Braunschweig.
"That was two counter gates too much, and we need to be more careful in Aue," says the defense player of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the Erzgebirge the three-chain is also to be further optimized.
And a gate after a free blow, the fortresses don't want to catch themselves any more.
"For the future, no one will be on the line next to Michael (Rising)."
Hoffmann is convinced that even after the experience of preparing the three-chain, his team is better off than with the four-chain.
"I still don't know how we're going to act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his thing, "because we have players in the three-chain on the half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann, who can build well," said Hoffmann.
"It is a prerequisite, but that we do even better to harmonise and that we do not afford so many play errors in the construction."
Of course Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"But if you can talk about a failed start after a decision, you don't know.
The performance could be fine, "Hoffmann said.
"But if we can stand on Sunday with four points and focus on the Cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a regular season start."
His coach didn't want to know about that.
"I only judge the start of the season after six to eight days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue, just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be broken off early because of a storm.
"Now they can actually start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher, because they don't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an up-and-coming favorite in their bones.
"But they don't know 100% where they are at the moment," says the interior defender of Fortuna.
The guests from the Rhineland will go to the meeting on Sunday at the (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"The fact that we have the right to get under the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga to beat from the beginning," explains Fortunas Chefcoach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and overwhelming."
And so Funkel does not want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of the Swedish asylum age evaluation tests published
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80% of the people tested are older than 18 years of age, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) has started to carry out the tests last year.
They should make the assessment of age more precise during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migration Network) has been criticised for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
To date, migration network has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years old."
The tests shall be carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are stable in recent months.
"We see no big difference in the statistics of the past few months, the figures are quite constant," he said to the magazine The Local.
The high proportion of cases where the person was considered to be more than 18 years old does not necessarily mean that the applicant has lied about his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that "suggest that the person under investigation is 18 years of age or older."
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
The assessment of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure, we shouldn't pretend we could, "he told the newspaper Metro.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of an adult being a child is low.
The greatest risk is if the person is just under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent. "
Full of plans
The work on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday a seven-ton concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good in time, it's going great," says Reinhold Licht, head of the road and transport department in the Freiburg government.
In April the work began at the same time on all three necessary bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The construction is planned for October and it is easy to ensure that the timetable is met.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a wooden bridge made of concrete, which is covered with red buntsandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, she has come into the years.
In order to ensure the stability and safety of the road, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red buntsandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are 12, and 10.60 meters long respectively.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.30 m wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.
This is a edge attachment, which is also used as a operating path.
On the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 m wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday.
Then let the pedestrian road run.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
Special fingertips have required the laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a glass fibre cable that many companies are connected to.
The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work by means of handbooks.
In addition, fish and crustaceans had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the Bauhofbuilding and the main building in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is controlled by a traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at Lauterbacher local entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is completely closed.
The total cost of the three bridge reconstructions is 700 000 euros.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bitter protest at German potato salad
It does not happen so often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to bring together.
The parties represented in the Kreisdag Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, Left) are part of a broad alliance, which on that day is a peaceful flag, because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites to the "great campaign of the elections" according to the poster.
And it brings known names to the start - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland is the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24, and the Deputy Federal President Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are on the ground hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the afd-ers, but want to demonstrate them.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful."
Originally the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at a table" on the fountain square, but now takes place in the parking lot below the roundabout - and thus directly in front of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
It's a colorful picture that's in there.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of the Forum One World and one of the most important organizers, is really pleased: "Great how many people have come together here."
There is music and a lot of food, including an "Urdeutsche Potato Salad, which the AFR could eat without any problems," says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, it also shows presence at the station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AFR actually get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulcan Eifel reports that he has worked for such an event and received the award.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first asked in Daun, but there had been a cancellation because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes there were not enough parking.
Now the Rondell, Hompes is happy that "we can have such a beautiful event here."
With a view to the event at the roundabout, he says, "This is the good right of people, most of all, it remains peaceful."
This is also the case: around 8 o'clock a band provides entertainment in the Rundellvorplatz, in the city hall several speakers, including the Rheinland-Pfalzischer AfD-Chairman Uwe Junge.
In the room there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the vice-president Beatrix von Storch to give their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials have had a quiet evening.
A little more than an hour takes the AfD event, the guests on the front course have a longer breath, but there is also a short time after 21 o'clock to clean up.
The police can move away - no special events.
Posaune meets trumpet
A reunion with the Wolfacher Posaunist Frederick Belli is available in the series Haslach monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 pm in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest," or also "Balkan Folklore" meets a classic German education with roots in bubble music.
Both soloists are winners and prize winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top-level orchestras.
For example, Petkov is a solo artist at the renowned concert building Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a solo artist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the limits on their instruments, but also to merge the limits of the different genres.
For example, Johann Sebastian Bach sounds to the two as in a new robe, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" is united with Bulgarian folklore, and in the play "Exchange Suite" of the Jazzechopreistrager Nils Wogram, in which classical, jazz and free play are mixed up into a fascinating work of art.
This core of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it specifically for the two musicians and more: The Haslach monastery church with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything, "says Kristen Stewart very openly about her bisexuality.
"Once I bite in grilled cheese, I think," Oh, that was cool, what's next? "
The most well-known relationship of the Hollywood star was the one to her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who finally went bitter apart.
Despite all this, the brunette actress in front of the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine assures: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I played it? "
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived and believed in dualism.
So it has never confused or obstructed me.
I just never liked not being taken seriously. "
She suffered especially under it, according to "Bang Showbiz," but in school, when she preferred to dress like a boy: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me.
When I was 11, the kids told me I'd look like a boy.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think, "Girl, be proud of you!"
She does not like to explain her love life to the public: "People expect you to be in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some call me ungrateful, but I don't like to have to justify myself to the whole public. "
The Governor of West Virginia announces that he is changing the party
The democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have gone away from me, "said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and many thoughts... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia that I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor."
The rally broke out in joy.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," added Justice.
"As a coach, I would say that it is time to play another game."
Mr. Trump promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve of the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he has coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee made a statement on Thursday night, saying: "The change of party of Governor Justice is another blow to a democratic party that would prevent us from working rather than making our country great again."
"With only 15 governors and the control of the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is unled from top to bottom and is unable to find a positive, some message," said RNC President Ronna McDaniel in a statement on CBS News.
Coe praises "honest" Russian apology for Doping scandal
The global leader of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious apology from Russia for a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the time for the country to be back in the sport.
Russia's athletic head Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that the banishment of his country from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were taken away from gold and silver medals at competitions."
Despite its comments, the IAEA Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-funded doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAF President Coe to the reporters.
"The whole Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized by itself that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its re-introduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the time to re-use Russia," said Coe.
"We have to do everything we can in the coming months to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupted system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will act as neutral players in the World Athletics Championships, which will start in London on Friday, in accordance with the strict IAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet some of the criteria for re-establishment.
Drug tests were still insufficient and prohibited trainers were still free to work, he said reporters in London after a lecture at the IAF Council.
Sad act for soldiers crashed in Mali
At a funeral in the North Hessian Fritzlar, about 1000 people of the two were thinking of killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Domstadt under high security conditions.
On the unexplained cause of the crash, Minister of Defence Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
But she described the two killed pilots as "the ability of their trade."
"We are facing this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old Major and 47-year-old Chief of Staff from North Hesse had died in West African Mali on Wednesday a week ago.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and brought to the Fritzlerer Dom Sankt Peter on Thursday by a death guard of the German army.
At noon, only the family in the church said good-bye.
After that, the funeral began in the circle of the family, close friends, of representatives of the Federal Army and of politics.
Among these were also Hessen's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the General Inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
The grieving ones laid down roses, and the family stood arm to arm on the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and many soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Minister of Defense of the Leyen called the killed soldiers "highly decorated" and operational experience.
The Chief of Staff had built up the flight operation of the combat helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regiment.
Also, Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, said: "If this crew could not turn away from the crash, no one would have been able to."
There was no doubt about the UN mission in Mali, but the Minister of the Leyen did not show that the operation was dangerous.
But it is also of great importance "for a country from which we are only separated by two states," she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
That's what the royal house said on Thursday.
The Danish royal couple is traditionally buried in the church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen was in agreement with her husband's decision, it was said in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik is buried, be still unclear.
But he does not intend to be buried in his French home.
Prince Henrik had never made a cry that he was not happy with his title.
After the throne of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016 he retired and also took the title "Prinzmahl."
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he does not consider himself equivalent to his wife - even after death, Lene Balleby, the head speaker of the Danish royal house.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will be, is still unclear.
But he does not intend to be buried in his French home, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he's been working for in the last 50 years.
The son of a French nobleman, Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked at the French Embassy at the Thames.
During his later wife, the people's sympathies always came to light, Prince Henrik had a heavy stand in his almost 50-year-old regency among the Danes.
In an autobiography, Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticised.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitting socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises I was smoking instead of Virginia tobacco and who were called here to be the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for forbearance.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed.
That was like two mistakes! "
Prime Minister Weil wants a quick reelection
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a rapid reelection of the country day after the loss of the red-green majority of government, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday, Parliament was in favour of the resolution.
Before that, the surprising resignation of a Green Member from her country-day group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the country election, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its short one-vote majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The previous Green Members Elke Twesten founded their step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in their constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she said on Friday in Hannover.
CDU Group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his group that they be included.
With this, CDU and FDP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land Day, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far, the relationship was the other way around.
The new country day will be regularly elected on 14 January next year.
Thümler said that the red-green state government now had to decide whether it could continue to rule in this situation without a majority.
Stephan Weil, however, considers it essential that the country day decide as quickly as possible on its self-resolution.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The national constitution also provides for the possibility that the country day will take away the trust of the Prime Minister and choose a successor.
"Our constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be properly examined, "said Thümler.
"All questions will be discussed in peace if they have been properly examined."
Thümler called two steps "but something curious."
The politician himself said, "I'm not a traitor.
I feel very good. "
She described herself as a supporter of black-green.
The Greens called on the renegade Members to return their country-day mandates.
"We assume, of course, that she will return her country-day mandate, which she has received through the green list of countries, with immediate effect," said President Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The Group president of the Green Group Anja Piel said: "We are extremely sorry for the decision taken by every second."
She had deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even in the light of the fact that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step."
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the resignation of the Lower Saxony Green Members Elke Twesten as a treason for the CDU.
"The behaviour of the former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only treason to the voters, but also treason to the Red-Green," the Federal Head of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to have the country day reelected quickly.
The two-way exit costs the majority of Red-Green in Lower Saxony.
The politician "in her injured vanity and in her frustration put her personal interests before the well-being of the country," criticised SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is taking part in this dirty intrigue game and is trying to beat political capital from it."
Lower Saxony's CDU Group Chief Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his deputies that every second be included in the CDU.
The Group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of falsifying the result of the 2013 country-day election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was then the strongest force before the SPD, but the SPD and the Greens had a very thin majority of one voice in the country day.
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisons, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in the interview with the German Editorial Network (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can the consumer protect himself from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print.
On the consumer protection portal www.Foodwarnung.de, the Federal Republic of Germany is setting up the latest information on the affected egg batches.
The eggs concerned should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, after all we know at the moment, health risks are practically excluded.
Is Aldi now taking over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the scout is not really perceived by the Federal Minister for Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has immediately turned off and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the German people became aware of the concern.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
The trade, like the manufacturers, has to ensure that the products sold are transport and health-safe.
If eggs exceed the maximum residue level of 0.005mg / kg, they are not transport-able.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time, the companies are not the fault.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, the production companies are not directly responsible.
Rather, they have to expect economic damage due to alleged illegal practices of service companies.
As always, there are too few inspectors in the case of serious cases.
Is there only a lack of staff or a lack of decisive competence?
It was the official controls that revealed the process.
The truth is, however, that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100% excluded.
This is precisely why a consistent information on such events and the transfer to the public prosecutors is crucial in cases where criminal offences may be present.
I have already made it clear several times that I expect the responsible authorities to provide me with complete information.
Is regular alarmism in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and viable food.
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The panicked means have put manufacturers, traders and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the keeping of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to be informed quickly and without delay.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditure by European football clubs will not disturb Neymar's world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences for Paris Saint-Germain will come from the UEFA, because the leading organisation that has monitored the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair-play rules set up by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must at some point prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly loosen the money so that Neymar can sign and take it to a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the energy-rich Katar's family of rulers.
Associations may spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but must be able to counter them with legitimate sources of income that allow them to break-even in their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs who had taken on huge debts in their quest for success effectively cheated and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP moved from the concentration to the debts of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a harder matter.
During the current three-year FFP programming period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million.
And even though Platini has been disgraced by the Presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to be committed to deterring excessive expenditure.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, to The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for the accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the redeemable amount of EUR 44.4 million can be shown in the annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, has taken the most serious sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014-15 Champions League are limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlist their financial supervision by blowing up their revenue by companies that are connected to the owners of a club.
While a cataric company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsorship were to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of the sponsorship of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could be made to the World Cup in 2022 in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar will become the World Cup ambassador and that one such maneuver could be easy to find for UEFA regulatory authorities.
The sanctions to date against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
The UEFA did not have any preparatory talks with PSG on Neymar's transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity, as they were not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year still have to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and tricot sales.
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after the signature.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go, and she tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the President of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar's last ownership of PSG.
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances a club.
"It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"As soon as a country has an association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country. "
Swiss is looking for a new shoe supplier
In recent years, Chocolate Frey has made board chocolate for the Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is before a possible end: the airline rewrites the order.
Swiss speaker Meike Fuhlrott confirmed at the request of the news agency sda a corresponding report of the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" of Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and subject to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the speaker.
About 17 million small red-white-packed 14-gram, 14-gram, the flight attendants distribute to the passengers before landing.
The Swiss did not want to provide information on the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Nordwestschweiz" to be between 1.5 and 2 million francs - the Migros daughter has an annual turnover of around one billion francs.
But the advertising effect is all the more important: for a chocolate manufacturer it is a prestigious task.
How many candidates there are in the new invitation to tender does not want to betray the Swiss.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey intends to try to renew the Treaty beyond the spring of 2018.
For the sda the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
The Swiss has been distributing chocolate plates on board their flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug.
The possibility to place the logo was introduced two and a half years ago by Swiss with the start of the cooperation with Chocolate Frey.
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-distance flights, the customers of the First Class are pampered with treats by the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the business class nach passengers Schoggi of Lindt and in the economy class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi is also distributed on the short track by Chocolat Frey, both in the business and in the economy class.
Light Athletics - Diskus Olympic winner Robert Harting reaches the World Cup final
The three-time world champion is fighting for a medal on Saturday in the final.
His brother Christoph, the 2016 Olympic winner, had failed in the national World Cup exclamation and could only look at the discus competition from the gallery.
In the first attempt, Piotr Malachovski, a Polish defender, also qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgia goes into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" in the niche
This replay of history is also nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80's, for the 90-year-old Grunge era (when the forethinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is also a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd humor (it contained an original story for a speaking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By increasing to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who grow up - they still managed to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later," with his adults who are now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the foundry principle, including a reef on the stalker movies of the 1990s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."
At one point a character stings through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovely Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novel author, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy-evil plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved, which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-managed impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the courses are the best part of the franchise.
It is particularly fun to see the ever-young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's underlip beard from "Singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like an old man.
It's the moments of random delusions that could heat this franchise like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series, until he reaches what I take as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the band how she will visit the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-West Ringfight iconography.
The comedy with Rhys Thomas as director, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, indicates that it is a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two police officers as friends, two officers from Bucharest who are fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-shot Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some beautiful gags to look at (the police spend time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like one.
In six long episodes, it goes there, and the comedy is not fast enough or often enough.
"Comrade Detective," which was edited to a lower length, could better deliver his agitprop satire, as Gregor and Iosef visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a feed for a face.
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own younger history and with their own.
The fight against drug mafia in the country
The police have managed to strike the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, many objects were searched in the Black Forest-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the Public Prosecutor informed Konstanz on Friday.
15 defendants were arrested between the age of 25 and 77 and have already issued arrest orders against them.
In addition, the officials secured a large amount of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested at the same time in Italy.
There were German arrest orders against the two suspects of Italy.
The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany.
The action involved Italian and Bavarian investigators.
A total of over 300 police officers were in use.
The members of the Mafia are accused of organised drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder, robbery and extortion.
Since summer 2016, the Public Prosecutor's Office has been investigating Constance against organised drug trafficking in the southern German area.
There was a strong exchange between the public prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, on Wednesday morning, the large-scale operation was accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
In the course of the investigations, Italian nationals, in particular, with close links to the Italian mafia, were particularly affected.
An incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired into a restaurant in the morning, is also expected to go to the gang's account.
Weiss complains big gaps in the foreign register
"Data from citizens who should not show up": According to a report, the foreign register in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious misdecisions in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Commissioner for the Federal Government's refugee management, Frank-Jürgen Wei, has drawn attention to large gaps in the foreign central register.
Weaknesses in the data recorded there could lead to "some serious misdecisions" in asylum procedures and deportation, warned in an analysis available to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung."
The register shows that 10 million people of foreign nationality are covered, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data are therefore managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts had not been good so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 had been found, "by people who are no longer alive, or by citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually appear in the register."
"Incorrect data input can significantly slow down return processes," the report says.
The statistics on people subject to sufficient resources also cover EU citizens who do not have to leave.
However, such false appointments have led to "a distorted debate on the handling of the exit agents," it is said in the analysis.
In the meantime, the Federal Government seems to have started sending refugee families back to Italy with children under 16 when they have arrived there.
This is the result of an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung."
The paper therefore states that BAMF has been carrying out such procedures "with regard to families with children, with the exception of infants and micro-children, to Italy since 1 June 2017."
Since the end of 2014 this was virtually no longer possible, the newspaper referred to the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Agreement, refugees from the EU Member States are responsible for reaching them first.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, this state can send him back to the country of entry.
The Office now writes on the grounds: "In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with children under age has increased significantly in Italy."
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECMR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
The national political spokesperson of the Left Group in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticised this decision: "Families with children are threatening to receive human rights and a threat to the child's well-being because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system."
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach was already available to other people.
At least from the 12 citizens who were awarded on Friday.
In the first place, Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, at the meeting of the municipal council, the municipality has a multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It is brilliant how our body is designed to do this and we pay tribute to the donors who provide their blood for strangers, even to this end unselfishly," said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single donation of blood helps several people," explained the circular head of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, for the canned are replaced into their components.
That way, three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
"This year, with 114 donors, we achieved the second best result," said the DRK Head of District.
Obviously, the change to the theatre has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago.
Before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half that many of them were booked by Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pftrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter spent ten times each 500 millilitres of their life juice.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation over an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "slow" when it maintained interest rates on family income in the middle of an increasing pressure.
The Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) policy makers voted 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members seeking to increase this month, as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to increase to just under 3% in autumn.
But it signalled that in the coming years interest rates would be needed to speed up the inflation stimulated by Brexit, and it said that credit costs might have to increase more than expected in the financial markets.
The members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammut business package, which was published a year after the Brexit.
It will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to make 15 billion more available under this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling.
In minutes after the interest rate decision, the Bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on real household income continues to burden consumption."
As regards interest rates, it reiterated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be necessary to cool down inflation and a "slightly larger" extent than markets expect.
The markets are currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "gradual" and "limited."
The Bank's downward growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the projected 1.9% and 1.7% in May.
It maintained its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell to the dollar and the euro after these news.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision to change is not taken after the recent disappointing growth rates have halted the growing expectations of an increase in interest rates and GDP has increased from 0.2% in the second quarter to 0.3% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly by the end of the year.
The recent inflation report has shown little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and small increases in wages, as the tightening of the labour force is getting worse first before it will improve.
It added that monetary policy will not "prevent" the loss of income in the coming years, but it added that wages will recover "clearly" at the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of the lower consumption expenditure.
The decision comes one year after the reduction of interest rates to 0.25% last August after the shocking EU vote, which caused the fall of the pound.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to fully reach prices and the economy.
Before the Bank's last judgment on interest rates, the call for an increase in interest rates had increased as inflation increased the pressure on hard-hit households, with three policy makers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% in June to 2.6% last month, although the Bank said that this was expected and will attract it again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the overrun in relation to its 2% target was "entirely" to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent fall in the swap rates, the mortgage market should become more competitive again, as the lenders are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market is particularly good for those who run out of existing deals and make new mortgages, and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular. "
NHS (National Health Service) is to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-sexual preexposure prophylaxis (PREP), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now supplied by the health service through a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to finance the process after the Court of Appeal confirmed last year a judgment of the Supreme Court that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The action announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England's chief Simon Stevens as "important new intervention," while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) called this a "crucial moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Preexposure prophylaxis (PREP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PREP significantly reduces HIV transmission in patients at risk of infection.
Taking PREP before sexual intercourse means that there are just enough drugs in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been treated successfully.
In clinics, appropriate participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a home doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study will assess the entire potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence, as it is used, taken up and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: "This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity. "
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it is targeted at people in need and at risk, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded experiment in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner, which will improve many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, chairman of the board of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the PREP test medicine has been acquired, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people. "
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and slow implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV-infected and that it will help to bring us closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society '.
Living the great life: the middle floor and smart designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, moved from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"Before that, I lived in a much larger room with my ex-wife in Knightsbridge," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something similar to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day. "
Since the first visit, the 1000 square feet apartment has been completely overtaken.
Originally a one-room property with a covered layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage room and an intermediate floor to make the most of the spacious ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
That was my request, "she says.
To this end, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5-foot ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms above each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the target.
"The steel works are quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked above each other without having to bend.
It was not just a question of building a simple platform, but of building the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below. "
This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height above each other - with much additional drama.
For the intermediate floor, a classic copper light window of Retrovius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
At both ends a short corridor is reflected to make it work longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.
By the perception of a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
It's not a new thing.
The special thing about this one is that it's a garage door.
"A little bit of engineering went in there," explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It is counterimportant, so that when you push the door up, it slips very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne was able to win an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the soil size."
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor area while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electric sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "
It shows that an apartment can turn into something quite amazing through good design and increased square meters from something standard.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave this.
Brothers fight for a $500 million property empire
Two brothers are in a dispute four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty because of one of Victoria's largest real estate emperors worth over 500 million dollars.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who brought him to the Supreme Court to see how their property and their business assets should be shared.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp discussion about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, collected since 1973, when the family bought a business on Smith Street, Collingwood.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail shops.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
This money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centres in the suburbs.
After an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - has about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul has about one third.
A court act says that this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediation, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control over the existing business - from which Colin, as Paul claims, has ruled him out.
Colin argues that this is not true, but he claims that Paul is incompetent in managing some of his possessions.
In an early Affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage requires that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs increase in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who were carrying out dairy bars and delicacies from the late 1950's and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first Jeanstore of the family.
Colin says that he started Westco there when he "was high school in my last years when Paul was a little child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Group, while Colin claims that Mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company.
Both Lukas and Mark, Paul says, "have become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation."
Colin was very reluctant, even though he was a former AHL member and after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered by SMS to say, "I really can't say much," because the case is in front of the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and to take our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current fight," he said, adding that he "still hopes for a solution."
On Friday, this hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If he does, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House Chief of Staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including the news media reports - in the hope of keeping the head on a more uniform course.
Here's a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new head of staff of the White House, met with senior staff on his first day of work, he was a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that came into the hands of the President.
Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letters - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information. "
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television has been back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was upset about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of posts that were to be convinced," said former campaign advisor Sam Nunberg in February to Politico.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officials know something that we don't know about others - that Trump's tweets would have contained even more explosives without their intervention.
We'll probably never know about the tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his employees have managed to keep him away from trouble a few times, then their efforts have been worth it.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House, which is made up of competing parties, are constantly trying to move forward their own agenda by presenting Trump material that might promote their views from the world.
In May, Politico, very concerned with this story, reported on the preference of the consultants to provide the President with questionable information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react to negative press cuts like a volcano, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is insisting on where they come from.
This was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave the President a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a bunch of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter because of harassment, or that he did not offer any concrete evidence, or that he has made false accusations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and started questioning employees about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reuce Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives."
How did it work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Maybe he will prove himself more effective as a priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still looking for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol
As the address is unknown, the help of the population is asked and hoped for.
The police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
As the addresses of the wanted serious criminals are of course not known, it is hoped and asked for information from the population.
Europol reported on Friday of the action following the "EU Most Wanted" Advent calendar of winter.
The experience had shown that many fugitives were hiding from holiday destinations, said by Europol.
21 postcards were compiled for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016 there is the website www.eumostwanted, more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed.
36 of the online requests have been arrested so far, at least 11 of them on the basis of information after publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate a ditch and return to the 'millionaires' series
Some of the wealthiest house owners in the West Midlands are once again at war with some determined travellers who have negotiated a ditch drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their manor houses.
The travellers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy road of Solihull called the "millionaires series."
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were only thrown out in May, but were not scared by a ditch dug out by the Council to prevent their attacks.
The tactful group found a gap in the defence systems and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Infuriating people have forced the Council of Solihull to say that it is "useless to deal with the problem."
An anonymous resident said, "They moved there on Monday night after they were sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones on the passers.
The Council must be forced to implement it by shame, because it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, were moved and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably more today. "
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long training to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my municipal tax if the Council cannot even stop it. "
A resident who didn't want to be called said, "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travellers just to be looted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area. "
One speaker from the Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work with the Solihull police. We take the necessary legal steps to ensure that they continue as soon as possible.
To support our evidence collection, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This will help to create a picture of the situation in which the court will have to examine when we will present our case. "
From Birkenhof will be Waldhotel Luise
The former Birkenhof Hotel will be the Waldhotel Luise.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and will be reopened on March 1 next year.
That's good news for the city.
With the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, some 30 000 nights were lost per year and also revenue from the tourist tax.
In the autumn of 2014, given the dramatic increase in the number of refugees who came to the district, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation to the Landrat, which led to controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision at that time was not undisputed in the municipal council.
But especially Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interest in the house at that time.
He should be right.
The group Luisenhotels with management director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star plus category called Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
Your name is Hotel Luise, Luise Park, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the previous Hotel Birkenhof there have been a long-standing construction container in front of the entrance, and when you enter the house, it is clear what extensive renovation work is being done.
The floors were torn out, ceilings partially dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building site.
There's still a lot to do by March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything was to become "very close to the citizens," as Thomas Scherer expressed.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are included.
You did not want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at a high city centre level, points out Scherer.
The Waldhotel Luise with its about 60 rooms wanted to set up a wide range, explains Scherer.
Both individual vacationers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He has already had talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, Scherer.
The city's ideas are the same as those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
When asked about the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to make a precise determination.
Just under a million euros, he's expecting.
The outside systems are also brought to the front, which is already clearly visible.
A large terrace is created in an inner courtyard, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."
Russia affair: US Special Investigator uses Grand Jury
In the Russia affair about US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is supposed to have set up a so-called Grand Jury after a report.
The body has started work in the last few weeks, wrote the Wall Street Journal, calling on people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper considered the step to be a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified his investigation.
The station CNN reported that there were already first presentations of the body in connection with a meeting between Trump's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence has been accusing the Kremlin for a long time of interfering in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there were any agreements between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.
The focus of the investigation is to be on several men who acted as a Republican's advisor in the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller was also more and more of a private and business environment.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator Trump personally went into the center and examined the accusation of whether the president might have impeded justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to charge.
Grand Jurys is also known as a court of law.
They are usually turned on when they are larger and controversial.
The procedure is always done behind closed doors.
The body may also be called on by the Public Prosecutor's Office to invite persons to be interrogated under oath.
According to the CNN station, there have already been invitations to the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
The report said that people who were involved in the meeting had been asked to make a statement.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former head of the election, Paul Manafort, were involved in the discussion.
Legal experts said on Thursday night on US television that the setting-up showed that Mueller was not intimidated in his work and that if necessary he wanted to act quickly.
However, it should not necessarily be said that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the charge.
However, the establishment of the body was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to present the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"Russia's history is a total invention," said Trump.
The subject gives the Democrats an opportunity to "feel good because they have nothing else to talk about."
His special advisor Ty Cobb stated in an opinion that he did not know about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
But this also usually works in secret, he stressed.
The White House is in favour of any measures that hasten the work of the special intermediary in a "fair" way.
The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that the president is not being investigated.
There is no reason to believe that this has changed, it was said in the statement.
Mueller was only used after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this draft, allegations against Trump had become loud that he wanted to obstruct justice.
In June, Comey announced to a Senate Committee that Trump had asked him to stop the investigation against the then national security advisor Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure for the investigation.
According to US media, the White House collected material against the special investigator and his employees.
It triggered speculation as to whether Trump wanted to release Mueller.
Unlike an independent special investigator of the Congress, such as the Watergate affair of President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Ministry of Justice at the request of the President.
However, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of Republican and democratic senators presented draft laws on Thursday, according to which the special agent could no longer be released as easily.
Antarctica: Gigantic iceberg in Antarctica
In the West Antarctica a huge iceberg of the almost seven times the size of Berlin has dissolved from the Schelfeis.
This was announced by the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The colossus, which is heavy and 5800 square kilometres over a trillion tons, now drive north and will probably take two or three years to melt it.
It is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the last three decades, with a length of 175 km and a width of up to 50 km.
He does not assume a danger to people.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the decline of the iceberg is unclear according to research.
In total, however, there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs of ice shells in the region for about 30 years, and the US research centre for snow and ice (NSIDC) has written in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
So far, the colossus that has been broken down was part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.
Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It therefore continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
To the north was the balance of growth and demolition disturbed a few years ago.
A complete schelfeis had collapsed there, AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes.
There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is also in danger, because the front edge has never been as far back as it is at the moment.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and may fall apart if a piece of it breaks down at a key point.
The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase the sea level, as they swim on the water and the ice is pushing as much water as it is after the melting itself.
However, the loss of the claw is a result of the glaciers being able to flow directly into the sea and much faster than before.
This may increase sea level, but only to a small extent, the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas) writes.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest Schelfeis in the Antarctic, according to AWI data, with almost 50 000 square kilometres.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks down regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.
"This is the broadest retreat since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it was disputed whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly fall together, his colleague Adrian Luckman said, "Our models say that it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Even though these researchers do not lead the end of this huge iceberg back to climate change, in recent decades, many ice shells of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart.
This long tip of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to the British Antarctic Survey's research programme, the Antarctic Peninsula's ice area has been down by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline.
In the past 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has heated by about three degrees and is thus one of the areas where the temperature is rising the fastest.
CDU wants Hausterif with staff
Because it is becoming more and more difficult to occupy vacant posts, the CDU is calling on to leave the employers' association to become more attractive.
It was just before the summer break that the Kreistag had 41 new places in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now another 17 trainees have their first working day behind them.
The teaching places in the circle are obviously very desirable.
Some 620 applications were made for the places to be awarded this year.
However, the circle still lacks staff to meet the increased requirements and tasks.
At present, there are still 50 unoccupied posts in the Mettmann district.
Among other things, the search is for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration.
The CDU would now like to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the Kreisdag and to respond to the lack of expertise in the administration.
The administration should, according to the wishes of the parties, "develop a concept for the development of human resources and human resources."
The aim is not only to cover short-term needs for skilled workers, but to address the problem of the future, it is said.
The overall approach should be directed both internally and externally, identify concrete measures for cross-beginners and include a training offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with staff problems that you didn't know before.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
It is a question of "competition from public employers."
In addition, there are a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.
So it is high time to act so that there are no more jobs left unoccupied.
But Klaus-Dieter Volk, the CDU's group leader, goes beyond the joint request with his party.
He recently made a big surprise in the Kreisdag when he publicly questioned the staff costs cover and surprised the other parties.
People want to see all the possibilities that allow them to leave the local employers' association.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the surrounding cities - should seek a home tariff," says the people.
This means that the CDU is trying to pay the employees and officials better than it actually provides for the public service tariff notice.
The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, there are increases or more money only if you change to a higher level, which is based on professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
It was only a few weeks ago that new areas had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new Prostitutes' Protection Act.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.
Italy tightens the tone of non-migrant lifeboats
Italy has warned NGOs using rescue boats for Mediterranean migrants that they may not continue to do so if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis's warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organization 'Youth Reportt' because their team had worked effectively with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed allegations by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority. So we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," said the organisation in an opinion on social media.
"We can only judge all the allegations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the 'Youth Save' boat, the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that his crew will take on board tubular migrants who will be delivered directly to them by human traffickers and that the smugglers will be able to leave so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting was allegedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the content of which was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of overseeing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reason.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must, above all, have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring about "substantial changes or disabilities" to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize winner organisation is doctors without borders (MSF).
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants who have arrived after the rescue measures in Italy has fallen significantly in recent weeks, which means that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and to cooperate with the local mayors have borne fruit.
"In the last few days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He announced plans for further discussions with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Increases and Trials
Nine Weilermer Biker, the "Berlin Outpost" and two guests met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy four days of trials and sights.
For this purpose, three friends of guidance were available.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards.
It followed points of view, partly on towers, from which you could see far above the forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there were more and more long increases, for the long trials rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Folkfest Wurstmarkt.
Another point of view was at the point of view, connected by "floating" trials and moderate increases.
In the last two days, there have been a lot of high-altitude calls.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and returnees brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed in the open-air inhaler, healing sole.
Neustadt was also controlled.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 meters of altitude, the group had met the forest of Pfälzer from its best side - sporty and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga is equipped for e-sport
Are the sports stars in the future sitting in front of computer consoles, instead of being sweaty in the wind and weather to fight over the stadium lawn?
The fact is that e-sport has long become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gays included.
This has also been recognised by the first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly involved in this area.
The VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015, later the FC Schalke 04 and last of all the VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sport department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope to inspire very new young target groups for the VfB," says the board Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure "that there are still a number of clubs on this train."
The next weekend, FIFA is organising the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London, where the gamers of different clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and the PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dumt also sees great potential in e-sport.
The ex-coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-athletes under contract, one could be more present online in these markets than only once a year to send the Federal League to Asia.
What exactly is this about?
In e-sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike," or just the football simulation FIFA are being played at the competition level.
For a long time, as in normal sports, there have been established leagues in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asia Games, e-sport is already part of the official program.
But is it even a real sport?
For many, the idea is certainly necessary.
Ingo Frobad has also been dealing with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports School in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classical sports - for example, increased heart frequencies, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also needs cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a rapid response.
Professional gamers should not only train on the console, but also their body and watch out for the diet.
"The fat player is a good player."
But Frobad also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more a subject."
Controls were difficult to do in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing.
The scientist points out positively the high integration effect of e-sport.
The players are on the international road, that's like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts a rapid growth in e-sport.
In 2016, 50 million euros were implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to be 130 million.
This is little against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga.
However, e-sport is "not far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte consultants write.
There are many countries on the international stage.
Large markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport competition provider Unikron.
There is also a lot going on in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sport was introduced as a field of teaching, says Frobad.
In the Netherlands and France, the first-time football league clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sport department according to Dumt.
"Germany is lagging behind in a European comparison," explains VfB's Board of Directors Röttgermann.
Only to fall into nostalgia, and to clarify the old times is not enough today.
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but at the same time to align the company with the modern market.
"We live in a digitised world," also says Dumt.
"You can't hold on to the fact that only football is the way it always was."
Gift Eggs ade - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking
The scandal of poisonous eggs now affects almost all the federal states.
Aldi South and Aldi North have reacted and taken all the eggs from the sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that have no fipronil are to be taken into the shelves.
Michelle Carter is convicted of the texts that put Conrad Roy on suicide.
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend to suicide by means of texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years on parole.
Carter was convicted in June for the negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who took his life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday, "My family is uncomforting.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was allowed to stay free until the call was made.
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr. Roy suffered from a mental illness.
In red pants and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and down eyes when she was convicted.
"Your actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She didn't take responsibility, "she said.
"She has shown no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "terrible circumstance that she was completely sorry for."
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said that he did not find out that "her age or maturity or even her mental illness have a significant influence on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother Lynn Roy saying there's "no day I don't trust the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pain we will bear for eternity, "it says in it.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she was being "persecuted" by the knowledge that she would never participate in her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"Not having this only person I've been with every day since I was born is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang up, jump from a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention by Roy's death and ordered her to benefit from the case by some press.
The case has shared the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murder in 2007 of her British roommate in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-lam of FC Bayern
The fact that Joshua Kimme was allowed to be captain at the Audi Cup is not a coincidence.
FC Bayern has a great season for the Confed Cup winner - there is no harm to extra motivation.
There was something else in his place in the cabin, which Joshua Kimme saw immediately, even though the additional garment was very, very small.
But as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, there was no Philipp Lahm or Manuel Neuer to be seen, he made the tie to his arm.
"The coach didn't announce it," said the Confed Cup winner after his first operation as a master of Bavaria.
Well, the record could have been better than the 0-2 against the SSC Naples.
But the coach's sign, Kimme, was able to point that out.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal was chosen as a player in the C-Elf, consisting of youth players, debits and just from the holiday, but he was chosen as a player.
Zuckerl is best distributed to those to whom you trust a lot that you want to keep in a mood.
So if you have been chosen to take on the legacy of Lahm, you can only use a little extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed, "This is what you want as a player: take responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flicked over the field as a mini-lamb.
Right back, that's his position now, the white tie on the arm did her rest.
And at all, Kimmich seemed to be in this starting formation like the one who could best take the rudder into his hand.
He gave instructions, tried to direct the unplayed force.
He had a look for the whole while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal to overplay his missing fitness (didn't work at all); Renato Sanches to come out in the devil to the services of the Asia journey (also due to the fact); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle to not be negative in their first appearance in the Bayern-Trikot.
That was a good thing.
Süle ran up next to Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defense, both acting sovereign.
The well-known Napoli storm was often difficult, and Süle also tried to be successful in the game building a few times.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not what we hoped."
But he also showed a proper performance in the debut.
Game shift, Tempochange: "I was also taken for this style."
How unusual this Bavarian world is for the new arrivals, you saw after the game.
Rudy, for example, gave in the catacombs not one or two, but probably six or seven interviews.
After a few brief statements, Kimmich said goodbye in the back of his new players.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "I have already noticed what is going on here.
In Bavaria, you just have to win every game. "
After all, he doesn't have to teach the new man any more.
Alaba motivates ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's most famous football player has reported to the public just before the game on Twitter and wishes the ÖFB ladies all the best.
The Bavarian Legionaire is in fact a club colleague of ÖFB-Kapitänin Schnaderbeck and is working with our ladies.
The Tweet of the Austrian football player of the year and the Champions League winner should be a special incentive.
The famous Bayern Dusel might need our ladies too.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economy praises Wissings Tempo
It was often unreconciled, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is apparent after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wising (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region are talking about a change in economic policy at T-V's request - and at the same time the old minister is in charge.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trierer Enterprises (VTU), says: "Wising takes up the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked."
The biggest turning point is that Natus sees in infrastructure policy: the closing of the motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list.
This year, the Ministry is still hoping for a planning procedure, and by 2021 the right to build is to stand.
A role in the country's plans is also played by the West bypass of Trier, which is in the urgent need of the Federal Transport Plan.
The aim is to put the line into operation in December 2020, says Minister-General Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a guide to supporting regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier, as suggested by Wissing, is seeking a label for the wine in Rhineland-Palatinate to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have been falling for ten years.
In addition, Wising has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, the IHK praises.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new Master Bonus as an additional incentive for young trainees, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros is provided for the existing master's exam and 2500 euros if graduates are self-employed within ten years of the master's training.
The country's homework list remains a long one.
The planned road construction was fast to create facts, at the same time the country lacks the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, head of the IHK Trier.
Of 56 new engineers who want to hire Wissing in the country's operations, only 29 jobs have been occupied so far.
The IHK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices.
CDU Group Vice Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors, which invest more than EUR 20 million in the maintenance of national roads than proposed in 2017 and 2018.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country as it wants to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
It was also encouraging that the country had so far expanded its broadband.
In 2016, regional companies had assessed the network supply in an IHK survey only with the note 3.4.
They complained about strolling Internet connections and breakdowns.
Former Minister of Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and is still in the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe, where it already cleared the field after four months of inconsistencies.
Audi is to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter-reaction
One day before Audi announced, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW president said that the company considered that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the companies as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The costs for car manufacturers to install systems to neutralise the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles are also increasing, which makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of hassling the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen that could control the use of so-called shut-off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the requirements when a car has been tested but are going back under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several employees of Volkswagen were charged and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in Audi's engine development was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent the emissions rules in Europe, and a question focused on the United States was extended.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could be a serious burden on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes over-proportionally to the profit of Volkswagen.
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for the Isar visitors to join us, a raft through Munich, which has a special message, will take place on Saturday morning.
If you go to the Isar again on Saturday, you will see a large raft there between a flute and a rich bridge.
And this is not a regular raft with Isar tourists.
But the building unit wants to clear up.
On the raft you can see a large infotransport.
It's showing a dump.
The start of a public relations campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True Love is..." the understanding of the Isar is to sharpen as a protective river of the wild.
Last summer the raft went over the Isar and this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a careful and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillo's noses and the laughter against the suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoon characters, the noses of his figures are his trademark.
At 85, the Argentinian still draws and works on a film.
His message: "Smile," because there is too much suffering in the world. "
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, he was also a character for lucky cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job lost," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he succeeded in the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in the "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
The artist was inspired by cities over and over again.
Large, round mordillo figures are in drawings with the sliding tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own information, he still sits at the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, T-shirts, plush animals and watches, his droll figures continue to find a lot of spread worldwide.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand-foot-finder as a counter-player.
For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D film, which is to come to the cinema wall in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're gonna say, it's weird for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
This is why he is more on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced without words.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is falling because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and the disease-borne insects, which causes great headaches to scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the life of lavender.
There is also a small cicade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicades, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts tourists, it is also very important for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said, "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have less parts with essential oil. "
The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slowing down of evaporation from the soil, but also the spraying of the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200-year anniversary.
The high point is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Cranes, fuses, traders, vagants or a land war camp are to be experienced in the city centre these days.
The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organised crime, corrupt officials and unstoppable drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They have been informed that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings are sufficient.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest from violence, and while the bodies are accumulating throughout the country, more and more journalists are present: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year.
Among the latter are their editor and inspiration of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical panamahut.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared issues, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal attorney was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings.
As with most thousands of murders that are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting and even though the terrain is still more treacherous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of security has little value, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we're all suspicious."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with the "12th River."
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly around free in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the country's most bloody battlefields, as rival groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa, one or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleen for drug-makers who are larger than many houses for the living.
For a minute, forget that there is a state of "peace" if only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
However, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken up in the guilt of not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damascus Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel groups in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have upset the sons, suspected gang members bought up every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kioske.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold 50 US dollar shareholdings.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to conduct journalism without meeting the problem of the drugs problem," said Bojorquez.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Prize" for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever it led.
He volunteered to admit he was scared.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take on the task that you are a journalist - either that or you play the stupid.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in the face of so many dead people... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
You trusted his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: was his love for routine his destruction?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their work and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runway to move drugs."
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result, even in the best times, is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said, that "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - as well as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where there is a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for security training, no cell phones were suddenly allowed. Days before it was announced that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were commissioned by the government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class quarter of Culiacan.
Half in the joke, some of the reporters were wondering if these officers were among the 50 percent of the police that the governor himself called untrustworthy.
It's been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug links are de facto under control.
For this week's issue, Riodoce has been looking at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposure to government expenditure, which focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was needed when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling institutional revolution party (PRI), which dominated almost the whole century all political levels.
A number of PRI governors have recently been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarbital asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military robbery.
Only a few months before, readers would have seen the column of Valdez as the most informed source of the abduction.
"In the past we would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slim body status.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
The office of Valdez was rededicated to the storage room for signs and stickers protesting the murders of journalists because the employees have become something they would never have expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez caught a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning for another journalist to the prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say it's his, based on DNA tests.
All over the country, journalists have become louder by writing down "SOS Press" on hoses and buildings in organized protests.
On that day, the director Bojorquez is gone in Washington, trying to collect international support for the justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed because they told the truth.
Since then, she has asked for the government to redistribute her because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organised crime, government officials involved in it and an indifferent society.
In his last book "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were covered by organised crime.
Last year, the "Articulo 19" media guard group assigned more than half of the attacks to police and civil servants.
"In Mexico, you die because they want you to shut up," said Ramirez.
Apparently, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found together with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to her separate head.
Some branches have chosen to close, like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of her director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with an article on the front page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it appears to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who remain behind and continue work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade is scaring him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue had already been completed, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all of them started to hump their phones.
A number of shootings with tyre rivals and security forces near the seaside resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region.
From the edge of the border they have published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens were crying up nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the police who were holding the guard to see if they were ready.
If they were even scared, they wouldn't show it.
Under the great portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed his footsteps.
"How can you even remember to close," said Bojorquez, "when the intern asked me to send her to the street for reporting on the same day that Javier was murdered."
Dinosaur used cloak to avoid his enemies
At first glance it looks like a statue, though a terrifying one.
Now, researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhino of a Canadian mining worker have been so well received that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa the dinosaurs."
It was so well preserved that they even found that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had something of a "troubled past."
The report in the magazine "Current Biology" called him "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly well-preserved state has stunned researchers who describe it as "really remarkable."
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant food is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.
He met something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rock at the scene, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of the earth.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you're just blinking with your eyes, you could almost believe it was sleeping," said the main author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.
"It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this plant food, although covered with armor and similar to a changing tank, was probably threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white cover to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as a counter-cathode, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed a better mix in its environment and avoid its enemies, experts say, which indicates that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines for the first time in May and can now be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to discover it carefully.
The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armour over his body.
They discovered the counter-shading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although the counter-assessment is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure by meat-eating dinosaurs, that evolution encouraged the disguise of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most of the contemporary animals that use counter-estimation - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signals that this nodosaur was subjected to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous period must have been," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal for evidence of his life, including its preserved intestinal content, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he fell on his back to the bottom of the sea.
At that time Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved shackled skin, but is also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," said Brown.
"The result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early Cretaceous period.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you're just a little peeling with your eyes, you could almost believe he's sleeping. "
The Cretaceous period was a time when huge theropodes, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, passed through the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six ton heavy monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was sunk after death in the sea and mummified in mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum it is the best preserved armored dinosaurs in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the snout to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tips, which took off his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored plant food was swam by Western Canada until an flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater storage of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisitem detail.
The stoned remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the house still cover hollow panels along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in the lotto.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it gets.
Stenched remains of the skin still cover the woody tank plates that carry the skull of the animal.
His right front foot is at his side, his five fingers are spread up.
I can count the scales on his sole '.
In the thunderstorm: mass carambola on A8: Many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday night on the A8: Almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambola.
There are many injured, kilometres of traffic - and Gaffer.
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8), in the late Thursday afternoon, about 20 people were injured in a mass carambola.
According to the police, around 5: 00 p.m. between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen connections (Aichach-Friedberg district) during a thunderstorm, almost 30 vehicles, including probably also trucks, were in each other's hands.
No information was available on the exact number of injured persons.
It was mild to moderate injuries, said a police speaker.
A large supply of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 was completely closed towards Munich.
In the direction of Munich a 10 km long back-stop was formed.
As an AZ reporter reports, there were also massive obstacles on the counter-road - due to numerous Gaffers.
The fire department noted the signs of the vehicle drivers, which are now expected to be subject to sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18: 45, a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the crash site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "Comfort check-in"
It is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: nothing apprehending is sitting on the train and sleeping.
Or you're in the middle of your work and you just have a brilliant thought.
And then, pufff.
The creator comes and wakes up an ungentle or pulls the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Car card control.
But the times of interruptions will soon be over.
The German railway is currently testing the unbridled control of the ticket.
You simply confirm by phone that you took your place and devaluate the ticket.
A test operation is currently in operation on two routes.
"If the offer comes up, let's extend it.
It is expected to be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance routes in Germany, "said a railway speaker.
"Comfort check-in" the train calls the ticket devaluation without the owner.
However, in order to be able to use these, some requirements need to be met: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - what most passengers do anyway.
You also have to use the app of the train that DB Navigator bought, which is anyway the most comfortable type of ticket booking.
And last but not least, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: you get on the train, you call your ticket under "My tickets."
The test customers then appear a button for electronic devaluation.
The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
When the train attendant comes to place Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already devalued online ticket.
So you can keep sleeping, keep working, keep quiet.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers.
"If you want to travel without a ticket control by our train attendant, just check in the DB Navigator yourself.
This allows passengers to make their travel time personal on the train, "says Michael Peterson, marketing board of DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."
Those who often drive the train know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, the ticket controls are one of the greatest difficulties.
Because often you do not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets, but in any case one of the visitors.
Either the credit card or the identity card is missing or there is a document to be presented.
The result is endless discussions between train attendant and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large space and delays in the control of your own ticket and in the end takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And this also only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other train numbers on the same track are not yet switched off.
How did an activist learn the answer to the question: "What Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.
Only one day after she arrived in New York City, the one born in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled on a post from someone in high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," they said.
It was confused, since no one else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly tweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was in the process of tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., live.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," thought Ferrell.
But death was nothing new to them and their community.
She took her phone off to return to Tweets later in the evening about people on the Canfield Drive.
There were photos of the police band and people who were screaming, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father who was wearing a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She was watching a live feed where a police officer was standing in front of a group of protesters with a calling dog.
In another video, she said, another cop unsecured his gun and shouted, "I will kill you... animals all."
"This is not common," Ferrell remembered her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder we have used to and we can call it typical."
At this moment, I felt chills.
I was angry and I cried. "
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After the landing at 11: 00, she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the next morning they would go to Ferguson.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years is the theme of a new documentary film, "Who Streets?," in the cinemas from the 11th
It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance that is from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell and her daughter, who had a flower dress and a matching crown, went to Ferguson, they discussed a conversation that they had a lot of times before this morning "about the black experience and the black state."
"You remember how I taught you when black people must fight for what they believe in?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take her, "said Ferrell later.
"What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
She must know it and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only to know activism and organization, but also to know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to become free to free ourselves.
Even though I have the luck of giving her an experience in which she personally does not experience a blatant racism, she is no different from the next black woman's child.
I feel like I'm doing her a bad job keeping her away from it. "
The first station they arrived in Ferguson was located on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charges of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local businessman who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to protesters.
Slowly a new type of activism for Ferrell began to take shape.
"My activism has completely changed after August 9," she said and noted that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis she was President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come. "
During an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar were just trying to "document" what happened.
One question came to mind: "Do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"
This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by white people - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently said in an interview, "We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not concentrate their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with the former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around death row inmates.
His commitment brought the project closer, together with six other locals followed the team of "Who Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks or talks to us for us. We talk," Davis said.
"This was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, for this is how I will be represented."
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement is "not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Who Streets?" surprisingly show personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrell, laughing when she first saw the finished product.
"But I understand that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who, after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin, marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media in 2012, identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole," said Ferrell, "and that is why we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything. "
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really held up by black women and many black women."
However, it insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action," in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who stirred up this energy," she said.
"It is no coincidence, even though she was at the front, because in a life at these crossings, as a black, gay woman, there is so much at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen. "
In the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration.
She describes the social-political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "A chaos."
However, she clings to a song and she feels obliged to this memory since she was on the road three years ago in Ferguson.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose, except our chains. "
From "Dream" to "Greatness": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, although it is not yet built.
But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been splitting the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold, the issue hardly leaves one.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."
While one of them says to the bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), from the other side comes: "Do not need a human being" (Siggi Betzen) or simply "Greatness!" (Lars Scholz).
While the supporters are building on the fact that a gallery is moving more customers into the city, which also benefits the other shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned on the property on which the farm market hall is located, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will end with the start of the construction work.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and that is to say to the Beda Square with possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "For many years we have been buying in the farm market hall almost weekly.
Mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the countrywomen always very much like.
We also discovered the butcher's equipment for us.
We would like to see this offer maintained even during and especially after the building of the gallery.
There are other cities, too.
The Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is especially interesting. "
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers are located in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent.
This is probably not very low in the new project. "
Eva Kilic: "Why buy spaläste in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugs or supermarkets: I find that unnecessary.
There's enough of that in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is maintained.
After all, the product offered there is fresh, is mainly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive.
As you can see, shop shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not sustainable for a retailer.
Too bad, there are almost no more special shops and what is left of them will probably disappear. "
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit in with Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the farm market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit gallery actually came at some point.
Or does the ghost bit gallery manage to distribute all the shops from Bitburg before? "
George Marquet: "This is just not gonna work.
And no one needs a shopping center that's empty.
I think it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery.
But there is no place for a farm market hall thanks to the crazy many - as I find - construction projects in Bitburg.
When the farm market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again. "
A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces - white, black and brown, which are almost the same - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfer and hair cuts, which were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst took a 35-year sentence after she made the secret classified diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website public.
The new exhibition, opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance (a suitable resemblance).
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dissident whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days left in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg has made a sharp, though intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on the identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.
Her image was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grain, black and white selfie, in which Manning is obviously sitting in a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette studs and chewing gum, by extracting the DNA from the waste to create a picture of what these people might look like.
That was the time she got an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They had an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg on a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to do a DNA portrait.
The artist and her incarcerated muse became unequal letter-rounds, which exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "Supported Images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which saw a future in which President Chelsea would change judgment and be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would actually call for Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is having a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new, two-way ways to further unravel the rigid divisions he was supposed to fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which was gender, race, sexuality and culture," with its oversized signature (the "i" in her family name is a heart).
On the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all by including the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist).
"What people will hopefully take with them is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of these stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a private room, is a page from the above mentioned comic novel.
She shows Manning how she comes up with a free-speech phone in her hand from the United States' disciplinary barracks like King Kong.
"If they cold up your speech, they won," they say.
"So never shut up."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose bumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was previewed in the comic book - but if it should do so, then it will be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the room, by its own genomic simulators, who gather together like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to size (5 "2, Manning Statur), where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind their liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford for killing
A country-wide human hunt is in progress for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University who are wanted as suspects after a man was stabbed in a luxury apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries.
On Monday, for Wyndham Lahim (42) and Andrew Warren (56), arrest orders were issued for murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the files of the General Court of Cook County show.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.
A Community warning system published by the Chicago Police Authority says that the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating the stings as murder, while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, said.
Lahim has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President of University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lahim was now on leave and was excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal matter that is being examined by the competent authorities and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesperson from the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the UK police and ready to help the US investigation authorities in any way possible."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to turn himself in.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Authority, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to stand up to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are strengthening," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police got a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who just got a mysterious tip that said something happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lahim and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
The management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the time axis and the background of the victim and are exploring a wide range of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the Roadmap, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap was updated in this respect, "said Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap for compliance with the code, which describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and has recently been published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, he has nothing to worry about Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future, "he added.
However, one of the criteria in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-funded doping in Russian sport.
With regard to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has made a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programmes, and we will not admit anything that does not exist. "
Mutko's words were in agreement with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted problems to the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally, "added Smirnov.
In November 2015, RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia as part of the Doping scandal.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit by the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Nigli said that RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" to be redeployed.
Aldi is not selling eggs for the time being
This is what the groups of companies reported.
It was a purely precautionary measure that it could not be expected to be further affected by health, it was stated in the Communication.
From now on, only eggs are expected to be delivered to Aldi, which has been proven to have been tested negatively for anti-inflammatory anti-lube.
Aldi wanted to create clarity and transparency among its customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not to become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure your luck with your employees on your e-commerce start-up, but the polls didn't work.
Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.
"There was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new race of human resources start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software, which has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to carry out surveys, address specific groups and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow Whistleblowers to circumvent the C-Suite managers and to contact the Board of Directors directly.
"You now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for the pursuit of their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees' commitment.
Errett said that she won a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low consent results - so that you can reprove why.
Companies come to see that you must remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you do not become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $11.7 billion worth in 2020, according to the financial engineering website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up converter, which helps companies to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity in the middle of the Uber case in miscredit at the beginning of this year.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send tailor-made "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the Chief Executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion has taken over the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.
If a company is found to treat its employees badly or unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures and have a simple way of reaching their corporate headquarters.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail for the company's headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees.
Now that the company is using Convercent, problems that have previously been hidden by managers who were in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practice - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of employment experience," said Vitrano, who runs Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.
But it took the "social media to come to their right" that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity to find the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in the financing in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which increased the total capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its total funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only operations.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company that belongs to their voices, and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employment Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data on employee engagement is important according to the experts of the workplace culture.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees about your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change does not come quickly enough, or not at all, this can breed disappointment and demo employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the business management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have too much to rely on collecting data.
"Because if you don't follow, employees will ask," Did you really hear me?
Are you taking care of it?
And who you don't care about, why should I? "
Madison Reed, now carrying out monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, says Errett.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganise several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insights into the employees, and it hopes that in the long term, this will lead to a better bond of workers in an industry known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you're gonna lose companies.
The NCAA removes the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It goes to 23 o'clock when a lot of UCLA football players talk on one side of the new training fields of the team on campus.
Some have pulled out their tricotudes and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these inaction minutes are a lunch break.
Players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6: 30 the next morning.
"This is a real treadmill for the boys for the next three days," said Bruins coach Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the burden of the players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.
This is why the first three UCLA training sessions should start at 7: 15 to meet the players' already completed schedule.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins moved the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras' six playtime in Westwood.
They are to perform 18 exercises in the course of August. 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supports the rule change of the NCAA, even if it adds another point to the highly busy routes of the players.
"We put this enormous burden on them for three or four days, and it is very challenging," said Mora.
"And they just pushed it through, they keep pasting, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great. "
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which, given the clear lines of view of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a high-class hotel that has already been thrown with peacemaking balls that have provided a protection net behind a gate post, will not be an easy task.
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend on, but Mora admitted that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," said Mora.
"This is a real problem, and it is not far to think that people rent a room there and then adapt to record an exercise there.
If you have the video tape from an exercise, it's a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking lot 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan. "
Facebook wants to step up facts review in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to third party auditors and then display their results under the original contribution, said the world's largest online social network on Thursday. It is one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to identify possible false messages and send them to fact-verifiers who will perhaps display results of the fact-testing from the original article.
Facebook was criticised as one of the main distribution points for so-called Fake News, many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they are not able to quickly eliminate hateful postings, as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook said that in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts review will be launched.
"In addition to the knowledge of what stories are being challenged by third party auditors, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "related article" and work on other changes to his message feed to reduce the wrong news.
Create a comic novel: A castle in the history of England
In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970's and 1980's.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
"I think it's so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who's been dead for 300 years," he says.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England 'covers the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book by Rhodes, based on an archive: in 2014 he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only reacted to the thumb print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"This is his thumb print!
And letters always smell like smoke, because then a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he was there himself.
Oh, I love archives! "
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest, I have overrated my welcome"), all this seems to be too beautiful to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the assembled hyan heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He walked through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape practitioners, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "whiskey and started writing."
The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust was only given full access in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, throw it on the attic. "
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps that represent who had what: "One could think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch who fought for the two families.
Guys, let everything go his way! "
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on a wider basis in English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought a uprising was a good start.
Maybe they're connected? "
Other stories are rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit Father, which the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century is presented, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite a crook, always making debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them to be a bunch of good-looking boys, with a talent to advertise them. "
After the end of his work at the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has spent a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with the fucking life again."
Campaign started: Over 300 years old Mary's Chapel in Rhöndorf
With the cover-up of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign for the introduction of a new roof brand (round show of Thursday) on Friday.
By Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Too good for us.
Or?, "the makers of the action have been asking since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel.
"We don't really think that (of course!)," they write on their website released yesterday.
"But we use this measure to gain your attention.
And to make it clear that some are better than it seems.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that as a bath of Honnefer citizens we know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city. "
The action is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it goes on.
"It is necessary to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable unique position."
Finally, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost an average five-digit amount of its new roof brand and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year in the beginning of August, in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises about pensions and promotions in the officers' corps.
So is this week.
At first glance, a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff, as before, but in the headquarters of the Prime Minister.
The five Vice-Prime Ministers, the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs, have also taken part in the discussions under the chairmanship of the Heads of State.
The civilians in the YAS were in excess.
The government is pulling the reins in the military.
General Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces and the Navy were dropped.
Since the failed coup, Chief of State Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exil-preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the wire driver of the coup attempt.
For 486 people who are supposed to have been directly involved in the coup attempt, negotiations have been taking place in Ankara since this week.
The day after the coup, Erdogan had already described the attempt to overthrow as a "gift of God," as he gave him the opportunity to "fully clean the forces."
But does Erdogan really control the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Unplease in the military headquarters."
On the general staff there were concerns about an increasing "Islamisation" of the army, which, among other things, manifests itself in the lifting of the ban on the headscarf of soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
The great cleanup of the army and the security forces is in any case continuing.
In mid-July, Erdogan had a decree to fire another 7395 state servants, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed like Erdogan tamed the military.
The generals used to be the masters of the country.
Three times they pured on their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his election in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least on the basis of the European Union's reform proposals.
Former officers say that Erdogan is actively promoting the Islamization of the armed forces.
In the "Vocal Europe" magazine, a particularly unnamed officer who was looking for asylum for the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad, warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and salafists" in a few years.
If this were true, such a development could not leave the nato cold.
However, there are doubts in the alliance after the purges about the readiness of the Turkish army to operate.
The management structures and operational skills were "weakened," say NATO diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It provides for the reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the US is spending the people of other countries on Green Cards."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English, who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy, "said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to clean up track for race shuttle
Again and again in the last few months the future of the race shuttle had been fought - now it is to be done very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, the marode route on which the tourist track runs is to be built.
In order to secure the future of the racing shuttle in the long term, the Ministry of Transport has stated that construction work on the track will continue this year.
"With the decision to continue ordering and rehabilitating the Ilmenau-Racesteig route, the country is committed to this particularly important link for tourism," said transport secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of repairing the route was about 2.5 million euros.
Of this sum, the country takes 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future, is currently being finally voted on, said Sühl.
The Ministry and the Südthüringen Bahn as an operator are already agreed on the technical details.
"This is how the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," said Sühl.
The proposed contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for an 11-year period.
This would allow the platform shuttle to be ordered regularly on December 2017.
The Racesteig-Shuttle is a railway link between the Ilmenau and the Racesteig stations, which is especially popular with tourists.
In recent months, pilot operations have tested whether the route is used by enough people to order it regularly in the future.
The route is also very close in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just when you thought it could not get any more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.
Yes, it is.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipples and the type of fingernails.
"People are making fun of them, but companies are delivering a lot of them, and we will see them much more often," said Mr Sharkey when he published his new report.
Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the robot's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it is even more worrying because many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have become robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as fragility.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of fragility and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted as possible to your personality," the website of True Companion warms.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods in the course of the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, she can be fixed to conversation or she can be "in the mood"! "
There are many worrying aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the incitement to rape, when one goes one step towards Frigid (this is the "opposing") Farrah, one is most concerned.
On his website, True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a roxxxy?" it says on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjection as an optional addition.
Most men will not, of course, hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they remain on the verge of consumption culture for the time being.
But what is leaking from the peripheral zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots show up at a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, where there is a president in the White House who has bragged to have sexually attacked women.
The most frightening aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Madge ') is not the graphic images, the entangled bodies and the outstretched eyes, but how realistic this vision is.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (though with pornostar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to imitate the movement of a real body.
But, to the point, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots are not real women.
You can't separate from your companion or just leave.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything that might disturb the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are false slaves.
Or to express it in the 2017 speech: maid
Trump's great power?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of healthy human understanding
It has become a sense of the trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have also split families in small format.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers in the United States with advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump's chosen relatives.
We're all supposed to be trying to blow our filter bubbles.
The power to bring families together has been less noticed.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship with which she had fought for decades for politics, is suddenly and very strange on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but I can see in a further context that this also brings significant risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disgraceful effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalisation" and trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his kittens will no longer be able to dispel us.
There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right wing "normalizes," which suddenly appear to be a concept of sensibility in comparison to its standards.
Today I find myself affected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urban version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax statement looked like) - both of which, in fact, appear to be a very mild crime compared to Trump.
If Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans has to be mentally healthy only to qualify as an unmeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousel of the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are curly and the animals turn to look at their own shoulders with fear - extremely dark and the climbing music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city is not fair to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a great roundabout in the north of London.
The Central Park Carousel, however, is still a strange magic experience, since here two two-year-old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40's can go on and have a great time.
If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately, no one asked.
On the other hand, this week in a department store I was forced to assess my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the evaluation with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the shop table.
This not only slows down what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required.
The poor woman in the department store was apologizing, while I was tired of giving her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius with chest pain from prison moved to hospital
This is the second time Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of cuts to his wrist, which he found to be suffering after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal from the prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a night-to-night intruder who was hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to commit this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appell, which they say is too cautious.
The National Law Enforcement Authority said that it would object to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the opposition could be heard this year.

There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
The last of the Blumberg schools was the fourth-class students from Fützen and Epfenhofen to be released into the holidays and to the secondary schools.
Three of the students will go to the high school in the future, four to the real school.
On Tuesday night, school director Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Biesental House in Espenhofen.
The 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle who grew up in the chicken farm but then was released into freedom.
This was followed by a musical called "The Eagle in the Chicken Court."
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg and had it spread out of his chickens.
A little eagle came out instead of a chicken chick.
But the hope of making him a chicken was broken, the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain and disappeared.
After that, the classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young gambles, the cylinders carried to the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school director Angelika Sitte.
Although the young animal is different from the other young animals (chicks), it is one of them.
But he'll never be like a chicken.
His purpose was to be free.
She wanted every four-year-old to feel accepted in his new school.
The following was thanks to colleagues, former head of the school Michael Müller, who is constantly in the case of school passports, and the parents' representatives.
The kitchen time was now over, said class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
After two years of teaching, she is very reluctant to leave her students because it was a really great time.
In the end, she was able to rely on the fourth-class students.
In the end, all students made a song of summer and holiday time sound.
There was great joy in the children.
Eight first-class students have already been registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camps in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television, reported.
On the morning of August 1, the police arrested a group of people who were illegally living in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
The same day they were released while an investigation is currently under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have strengthened control over free camping and impose significant fines on anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The controls will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry said that the court can impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What those concerned need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers in an overview.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust gas behaviour of cars of the Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 emission classes.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europe gives an estimate:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates before apply only to the vehicles that have mud software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofitting has been ordered by the Federal Aviation Office (KBA).
How and from when are customers informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months but have not yet specified a precise date.
Daimler has announced that he has written to each of the parties concerned.
If an inspection is due anyway, it will be done within the framework of it.
How long is the overall change expected to take?
"Hard to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of manufacturers as well as on political pressure.
"For we have seen that the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment."
How long is the update supposed to take?
The change itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who do not drive BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?
The ACE advises to wait.
According to Smetanin, it is likely that foreign producers would be following up.
Is there a threat of a massive fall in the price of euro-4 cars?
The ACE is afraid of that.
But in the regions where driving bans are at risk.
There have been no losses in the value of older diesel in rural areas so far.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners doesn't want to come - out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to get one of the most sought-after awards of the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year also singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honored.
The awards will be given in early December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and participate in the ceremony together with his wife Melania.
Lear, who was announced with progressive TV series, has already announced that he would not take part in the gala.
The "New York Times" he said: "This Presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to take the means away from them - and that is what is bothering me."
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to make her point of view clear.
The Kennedy Centre, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
The former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city builder, is retiring next year.
The job has already been written out - but suitable candidates are very close.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And the work is still very much fun for him, as he talks in the press.
He reports on a variety of tasks, but also demanding, that are waiting for his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application has yet fulfilled the requirements profile.
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the next possible time.
In this way, with due regard for the regular notice periods, there is still enough time to be put in place.
Since Haslach acts as the lower building law authority for the administrative community, the applicant must provide the relevant financial statements.
Because this function definitely wants to keep the city.
If they were no longer able to fill them out, citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But close to the city and to itself is important, says Wacker, who reports about a good business climate and a good mood between authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, a number of important projects have been gathered to look back on the wackers with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure about the building office and his employees.
But also in the future, a variety of projects are on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz, for example, have been launched.
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the stadium renovation is still a subject.
The latter alone will make a contribution with about 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," estimates Wacker.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun. "
There is a great room for a city builder.
With Haslach's own building yard and gardening, a lot of things could be reacted quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green facilities is often praised by citizens and visitors.
As the old town is under monument protection as an ensemble, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city builder stresses.
In any case, the city builder has a high responsibility.
He's a builder, "in the end, everything goes over my table."
With care and coordination he can count on many years of staff: Markus Neumaier (building) has been there for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) for 15 years.
Also, that his successor will stay long, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place."
For continuity is important not only for a good business climate, but also for the further design of the city.
According to the city of Haslach, those who want to inherit Roland Wacker should be able to present a completed study as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor of Architecture and have good expertise in the field of construction and planning law.
The city building office is responsible for building and civil engineering, construction management, basic employment, urban property management, urban works court with a Bauhof and a municipal gardening plant, and the lower building law authority, including the protection of monuments.
Bicycle thrown on lines: South track closed
According to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bike from the train transfer in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) on the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators go out from two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours.
Close to the crime scene, witnesses had observed a pink scooter and a bicycle driver.
"This goes far beyond a lauscube," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA.
He or the perpetrators would have put himself in great danger and also put the train traffic at risk.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, as well as the delay minutes and the costs of the rail replacement traffic, it could also be possible for the railway customers to get a toll on the perpetrators.
Overall, the speaker said that a "significant" sum had to be assumed.
The damage had been corrected on Friday afternoon, the railway traffic on the south track could be carried out without any disabilities.
Almost ten passenger trains had failed on Friday morning, two of which concerned long-distance transport.
Freight trains did not fail, but they were late.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, about 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Isolators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate could help to relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare to your digestive system.
But a new study says exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and milk products could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.
The incurable state, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloats, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
While the people concerned are usually advised to avoid meat and milk products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, said that immune cells are patrolling in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of causing inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease.
In experiments it was found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell is present in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a connection between a type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbial, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "
He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote more tolerant, less flammable intestinal environment, if the same system also works in humans.
The postdoctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was not housed separately, had this.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the bowel cancer of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and six types of bacteria were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells but without them in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that they were missing a intestinal cancer and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria had an effect on the immune system, researchers L. reuteri had to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells that were isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan metabolism known as indol 3 lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophanes were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether Tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to Tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
In the presence of L. reuteri, high tryptophanes can potentially lead to an extension of this population. "
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic signed a "genius," Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began with a 2-1 win in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid started on Tuesday, and impressed in the Halter role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira started to be popular.
However, Matic had been excluded from the Blues' preparatory Asia tour and only managed to make it 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted, that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started in the Aviva stadium, when Mourinho formed his start XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic work" to fulfil three of its four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, for that I thank the club," he added.
"I will be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they have made a great effort."
Boeing "paints" Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner into the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the U.S. state of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner over the US, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
The shape of a Dreamliner was to be on the radar screens.
The whole thing was a stamina test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such advertising before.
The number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New low impact for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
As the wind turns, when Sigmar Gabriel was still the head of the SPD, social-democratic prime ministers always looked at Berlin with a certain concern before the elections.
Just no stormy fire from the party centre, just no counterwind from the federal government - that was the most important wish of the election fighters.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the staff from the Willy Brandt House have been watching the events in the SPD-controlled state capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz has been getting from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with counterwind.
It was a low-impact.
One at a time.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against the coalition of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-Green simply cannot rule reliably," said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber to the German editorial network (RND).
The surprising exit of a Green Member has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the country election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Green Federal Executive Michael Kellner has called on the outgoing Lower Saxony Green Members to give back their mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of the will of the electorate.
Each Twins must immediately return their mandate, "said the Federal Executive and Head of the Green Party to the German Editorial Network (RND).
"This must not be true at all," a SPD election fighter smiles when on Friday morning the new Hiobsmessage reaches the party center.
Stephan Weil, Prime Minister of the SPD of Lower Saxony, is in the CDU without a majority of its own government after the Green Members have passed on to Elke Twesten.
It is the provisional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD national associations.
And no one knows what's next.
The failure began with the unexpectedly significant defeat of the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, that's all, the comrades calmed down at the time.
After the country-day elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
That was what it was then - and everything was getting worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to a halt, the Düsseldorf-Pleite shaved the party smoothly.
The comrades picked up in the weeks after that.
Then, when they had just made new courage, the G-20 summit of Hamburg came.
And with him came the next low.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD head of country, lost his nimbus that weekend because he was in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.
And because in crisis communication after that, he did pretty much everything you can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW exhaust gas affair and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for a long time.
Mad survey values were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps because of this, because in the past few weeks has been more and more trying to make an accent in the federal government.
The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin were not hidden from comrades in the area of Martin Schulz.
They had it granted, as they promised themselves that the party would stabilise.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
In doing so, because of the party-internal twist of the Lower Saxony Greens, there is basically no blame.
And Schulz isn't.
At the moment, the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed.
Their anger is directed at the Greens, and here, above all, at the renegade parliamentarians, Twesten.
"It is unbearable and democratic, as Mrs Twesten places her own career interests on the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party's left in the SPD Bundestag Group, the German editorial network (RND).
Mrs Twesten has not been elected to Parliament because of her person as a direct candidate, but rather through the list of countries of the Lower Saxony Greens, the Lower Saxony Member continues.
The logical consequence would be that she would return her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Bundestag Group, is complaining of an "undemocratic maneuver."
"The election will four years ago was clear: people have made Stephan Weil Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxon SPD as a top candidate in the Bundestag election, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU member falsifies the election result," said Oppermann.
He asked for the background to be clarified.
I want to know if there has been more or if there have been further commitments from the CDU Lower Saxony.
Funding for local core III
Those who want to rehabilitate their home in the years will soon be able to receive support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG City Development informed about this on Wednesday in receptions.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a look at what has happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitated areas in receptions.
At that time, in the restructuring area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land of Baden-Württemberg took over two-thirds of the funding.
In the restructuring area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60%.
For Schindler, the so-called "success project" is a "success project" - it is also important to promote internal development, and not only to open up new areas of construction.
On April 4, the Karlsruhe Government Prize received information that there will be a rehabilitation area III.
The total funding was 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros came from the country, the rest from the community of receptions.
So how does a redevelopment area develop?
One will, according to Schindler, investigate where the "really old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role in rehabilitating whether there is any interest in the planned area at all.
If necessary, the territorial borders could then also be relocated.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday night.
Keller presented the content of the federal-country programme "Social City," in which the refurbishment would then be carried out.
The programme is based on the revitalisation of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure.
The measures would be subject to object-related measures, that is, per land.
The area would then be established as a statute.
The period of authorisation of the funding has been running until 30 April 2026 from 1 January 2017.
However, until September this year, the inventory would be carried out for the first time, in the framework of which the parties to the restructuring area will receive a questionnaire to fill in.
In November or December, as far as possible, the decision on the constitution is to be taken in order to be able to start the restructuring process next year.
Pietzschmann then stated that each municipality had to carry out the above-mentioned pre-investigation.
It is about assessing the urban maladministration and deciding when and to what extent it will be remedied.
A redesign note will then be entered in the basic book for the respective land.
Pietzschmann will come again to the receptions and take a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that the participation of the parties was an essential factor in the success of the project.
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed until the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land sheet," which concerns, among other things, the construction state and the redevelopment plans.
The grey questionnaire, the "household and housing arches," can provide information on the size, distribution and inhabitants of a housing area.
The blue "operating sheet" shall be completed only if business premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures were not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of the funding works in accordance with the "Winddog principle" - who comes first, makes the first.
You can't "reserve" funding for later on.
Finally, photos of the project "local core II" were shown in order to make the present a "tasty" renovation.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to get into the house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he can open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has joined Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is similar to a cat and dogs implanted microchip and only takes 30 seconds.
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for an extra charge of £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is at the wheel.
The White House's advertising costs cost the taxpayer thousands
The White House's decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American production last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000 according to the military's information that was left to the TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and White House officials took a tour of products from all 50 countries.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was issued next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire-fighting car and a Mississippi forklift.
The White House military office requested the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," the commander of the HMX-1 wrote on the eve of the event of his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation.
The news showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on July 17 at 7: 00 in the morning for the event at 3: 00 and remained until the lawn was cleared between 6: 00 and 9: 00 that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was to be delayed, a second team would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of hours of service.
The original flight crew was on the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained on the ground during the time.
The records made available to the TIME did not clearly show whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 has asked if the event could violate the determination.
"One question we asked was whether it was a breach of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked," the deputy commander answered.
The "Made in America" event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political sounds.
At the event, the President gave an impetus to the reform of the health reform that was under way in the Senate, and he prophesied efforts to curb government legislation.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.
But to request their use only for a photo operation is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the president aircraft was in charge of taxi services in the context of its first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and its Twitter account is full of reports that complained about the use of the president aircraft by its predecessor.
"The White House is thrilled with the show" Made In America "- the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials," said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights in the Washington and South Lawn area to drop the US President in the White House with precise centimeter operations.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 carried out 58 training landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said an official.
Helicopter units also flew 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said that the taxpayers did not take over the burden for any of the other props presented at the event.
A speaker from Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in the issue of the helicopter on South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact costs of the event.
However, according to the US Ministry of Defence hourly rates for the financial year 2017, the DoD rate for the VH-3D is USD 24,380 per hour of flight.
The unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual costs of operating the helicopter are well below this rate.
"To set the costs for taxpayers on the basis of the estimates of the rates of refund is highly misleading," said Walters.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual budget."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the rates of refund for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract conclusion.
At that time, the former White House press speaker, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present things that are produced in America this week," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands of people, depend on it.
And I think like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight that. "
It was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire car.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky, and with the media, he was joking about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss before a difficult task
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website * Official website
The TC Blue-Weiss Neuss will be in Kiel tomorrow at 11: 00 at the end of the table for the Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite five games, the top rider of the Second Tennis League has maintained the sense of reality.
In any case, Team Chief Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
In the rear positions I find the team very good. "
For class and stability at the search village SV above all the imports from the high north are concerned.
"Their Danes and Finns can even refer to operations in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in the double, "says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerhus (all Denmark).
"This is gonna be hard for us as always.
You also need a good portion of luck. "
The Neusser team for the trip to the high north is practically standing.
His debut for Blue-White could give Maxime Janvier.
If the French still active at the Challenger tournament in the Italian biella does not make it to the Bundesliga, the Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), playing in the Czech Liberec, will be the first to play this season.
The so far undefeated Chilene Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was still at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel at the ball with the white-Russian Andrei Vasilevsky.
He was to be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschup, Niels Lootsma (both the Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club on the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also join the team again.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still the number one of the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the team around Marius Zay will fill the box.
How America can harm the OMV
Donald Trump really didn't seem happy when he signed the law on Wednesday night to strengthen sanctions against Russia.
"In his power to adopt the law," Congress put in a few "unconstitutional rules," he dared.
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was ashamed of the US advance.
After all, the draft provides for the punishment of European companies that help the Russians to build gas pipelines into the EU.
Since then, investors from the local OMV have been thus concerned, who, together with other European companies, co-financed the construction of the Russian East Sea line North Stream 2.
The threat scene is huge.
However, it was too early for an assessment of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil group.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by the Executive Order.
Twelve weapons are at his disposal.
"The press" has looked at which the group could defend and which could really hurt him.
Narcos season 3 trailers: Without Pablo Escobar the Cali Cartel is put into the center of the heat series of Netflix
Despite the second season of Narcos, which Pablo Escobar's killer reveals, the series of Netflix is far from over.
The three and four seasons were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest bad guys on the show.
With the third season, the DEA has focused its attention on the richest organisation of drug trafficking in the world: the Cali cartel.
led by four powerful godparents, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more state bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazot) is located in New York.
In the newly published trailer Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement authorities to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bthe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will start on September 1.
Role backwards: The city places 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the Kita lunch table itself again.
With fixed contact for the children and a team assignment.
The clock is turned back in the city's children's daycare facilities.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the city's day-care facilities (Kitas) in its own direction.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of the Department of Youth Assistance, this is a good news: "We have all been very pleased."
Cooking is still out of the house: a caterer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked.
The city operates in the Krefeld area 46 day care facilities, in 44 the children get a warm meal at lunch time.
Over the past year, 2800 children were sitting at the tables, and the need is growing steadily.
"In the meantime, not only children who have 45 hours of care are now eating at lunch in the Kita," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer also applies in the 35-hour care when children stay until 2: 00."
46 part-time workers will have kitchen service from 1 September: they will heat up the supplied food, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, port the meal individually, spend the food, clean, wash and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are permanently assigned to a kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups of facilities - decides the scope of the hour.
"The kitchen helpers are now firmly part of the Kita team," says Pommeranz.
"They are much more involved in this way and it is easier to implement educational concepts for the city administration."
It is also about healthy food and cooking lessons.
"The children should help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team would be useful.
For the children, too.
"They have a known power in the Kita, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity was important for the children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen workers - will be done by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has, in addition to improving the quality of the kitchen performance, the charm that it has turned out to be the most economic in comparison to the cost of self-government and the distribution of foreign goods to the city, is said by the Press Office.
And that, although 46 part-time workers are being rerecruited.
"But these hours do not fall so much into the weight of some 750 people in the education area," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations mission, said that hundreds of women will be candidates for the Council elections in the provinces. Three women are candidates for the role of Vice-President and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said on Wednesday in a statement.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the election process.
Afghan elections for the Provincial Council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have published threats to an election process that is linked to the transition from international fighting to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will give the power peacefully from a democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will strengthen Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan independent election commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3.6 million voters.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girls
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to the police, the men were talking to the 13-year-old, who stayed with friends on the Kolping Road around 2: 55 because they wanted to call the girl's phone.
The 13-year-old, however, refused the request and continued with her friends.
Then one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl's cell phone and necklace, but this failed.
Without the prey, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigation is ongoing.
GMB concern about investments in the McVtitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union would like to make sure that the long-term commitment to production in its plant in Glasgow is made by the Biscuit manufacturer McVtitie.
GMB Scotland said that the company had kept silent about the future of investments at the rabies site.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, which produces cookies in addition to other products Hobnobs and Rich Tea.
McVitie's owner Pladis said he's invested more than 5 million pounds in the last few years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would "be the first to know" if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB called on Scotland McVtitie's "to express concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be advanced."
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we can't get clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tolcross by the General Site Manager concerns our members deeply.
A number of generations of families have worked here, and the labour force is focusing heavily on the local community and the Glasgow area, an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the background of the Brexit, the increasing cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flourishing production presence at McVtitie. "
One speaker from Pladis said: "The branch manager at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly to it, as we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our rabies site, in particular in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a production site. If our business processes change at the site, the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know this. "
Did the PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar three years ago?
The side of La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not fail in her persecution of Neymar after she has made an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago of the world record-robbing?
The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for £89 million last season.
After the end, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the most paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than GBP 500,000 per week.
Barcelona is angry at the way that Neymar has forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG President?
When Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to have one of PSG's best players signed.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players to sign with them, this will have consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in the PSG middle-level player Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar.
Roller overthrown and damaged
On the night from Friday to Saturday, an unknown offender deliberately turned over a scooter in the Königsfelder Straße in front of the property number 30 and thus made material damage to the vehicle's clothing of more than 200 euros.
The Schramberg police, telephone 07422 / 27 01-0, ask for clues.
The police are looking for witnesses for an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because a car ran into him on his way, the driver of a VW Touran had to avoid and touched the control board.
On Thursday night, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum and his VW were on the B 215 from Stolzenau on the way to Leese.
In the area of the local bypass of Stolzenau, a car came to meet him on his lane, so he had to move to the right.
The tour driver toured the board.
The car was damaged.
The driver of the car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident.
According to the victim, it may be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police now ask witnesses of the incident and the driver of the vehicle to contact the Commission in Stolzenau under Tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.
That means author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburg Domspatzen continues to provide discussion.
Christian Weisnder, spokesperson for the reform movement "We are Church," said after publication to the German Press Agency, expects an apology from the former Regensburg Bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, and from the domakapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emanated Pope Benedict XVI.
It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false assessment of the processes.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano," however, criticised the fact that "two-fold measure" is being measured in the reporting of violence in the Domspatzen.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubt that they are "shameful and shameful acts" which should be punished and prevented in the future, but the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, according to author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evil is already part of the experience of everyday life and is preparing the public opinion to consider this to be normal," writes Scaraffia.
In the interview with the Bayerische Rundfunk, Princess Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also said: "You like to go to the church and this is a found food."
She also pointed out that, in her youth, "beats had been a normal educational means" to deal with naughty children, as I was one. "
They would find it unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades, because the world has changed.
In the context of the reports on the abuse cases, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
The author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memory band "My Brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages), is completely wrong.
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who was responsible for the education of the diocese of Regensburg?
A total of 547 Regensburg Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen.
The final report says to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can be said that in many cases forms of physical and mental violence have been applied by Domkapellmeister R..
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
However, unlike many other accused, many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even linked positive memories to him, despite violence. "
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is in his opinion relieved.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence in the Regensburg Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students highlight his "humanity."
On the other hand, he also appears as a cholerist and perfectionist, who became more and more tangible when a cathedral has not brought a top performance in music.
How do you value this final report as his biographer?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the effort and read the whole 440 pages of report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is even in it.
There are only eight sides dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of co-worker or co-knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The acts of violence at the preschool also occurred outside his sphere of action.
At best, it can be accused of being too late or of not taking the first remarks seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by practically all respondents as "redemption," "heaven," and "better world."
The vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, also presents a very excellent testimony, describes him as "warm-hearted," "popular," "sincere," "competent," and "understanding," as a very kind teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and was "always surrounded by grapes of children."
Only a minority complain about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to anger.
That he not only shot with chairs and threw the key band on the ground, but also distributed figs and pulled too bad guys to the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
It must be said, however, that, in the 1960s and 1970s, such educational methods were widely used by parents as well as teachers.
Do you also know such breeding methods?
Of course, I think each of us was born before 1968.
I, too, have experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
In comparison with what this report is actually about, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the violence in the preschool, these are, of course, bagatels.
The question is whether it has to do with his knowledge and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just fell on him.
Many who have never understood him are still working on the Bavarian Pope.
But the truth is, the report is unburdened by Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
In the media, a great deal has been reported about the issue of abuse in the Regensburg Domspatzen in the context of the report.
Is Georg Ratzinger also being put at risk in the final report of any involvement or involvement in sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claim to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellmeister.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
"I have never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," one of the people involved said to the others, "It was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem with the education of sexual abuse was, and is, that most victims remain silent from shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a professional way.
How do the Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger's role in the abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: A student in question said: "With regard to sexual abuse... I see no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the individual perpetrator.
I think it's... really absurd to assume that, in the first place, he has opened up... more intrusive, more clear, more than to her parents, Internet leaders, trust teachers, etc.
That you talk to him about sex... unthinkable. "
The report thus comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that students and / or their environment have been entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation."
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, therefore, Georg Ratzinger is free of any co-knowledge.
He cannot be accused of not preventing him or bringing him to the notice.
There is therefore no reason to link his good name to these contradictory crimes, as has unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media, a lot of "violence" was read at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Looking away."
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that in the report everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that, in turn, is an abuse of the report.
This is a clear separation: between the preschool and the high school of the spatts, between sexual abuse and violence, and, let us say, other allegations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from 1945, that is, from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the head of the cathedral.
The whole terrible fight education, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were quite shocked and painted and suffered horribly, all of them occurred at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have been in place.
But they had nothing to do with the master of the cathedral Georg Ratzinger, because he only got the boys to face when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
On that, as most witnesses stress, the subject of "preschool" was taboo.
One was only happy to have escaped her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "Paradise" states.
What else was at the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him despite violence."
This is the only way to blame you for looking away.
However, despite all the efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported by the state of the preschool.
The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and of the operations at a school where he did not work and was responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently swallow his ears before the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
He pointed out that "in the preschool, the penalty will continue to be applied."
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.
This was, of course, at a time when there was legal clarity, when penalties for the fight were long forbidden in Bavaria as well.
Before that, they were in a legal grey zone, as each of us must remember.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the people concerned might have been exaggerated or dramatic and where the allowed limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was only in 1980 that the penalty was officially abolished at schools in Bavaria as well.
Princess Gloria von Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards for the time being.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "trap of anachronism," that is, the danger of assessing the past in accordance with today's moral standards.
The princess is right about that.
But this does not apply, of course, to sexual abuse, which at all times was abominable, and not to what was broken in the preschool by the disgust and violence of innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond what was usual at that time.
This is all very terrible, and I'm glad it's finally being worked out.
But at the same time, I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all of this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, in other words, to draw figs and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then forbidden, he also strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his Regensburg time has Georg Ratzinger shown in the talks with you for the book "My brother of the Pope"?
Did the subject of the fight also come up?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, telling from his perspective that the Domspatzen played only a minor role.
Nevertheless, I do not conceal that he led a strict regiment there.
But this must also be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand for unconditional discipline, it would have been difficult for him to form an institution of world rang, true cultural emissaries of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the US (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991) from the more well-known, national-known Regensburg Domspatzen.
With cookies and chocolates alone, you do not make a great singer and stand before every success, in any area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
What kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger in the talks about her book?
Michael Hesemann: By working on the book and beyond, I have really met Georg Ratzinger very well and I have always seen him as a wonderful, humorous, graceful, deeply believing and heartfelt person, from which one cannot imagine that he could do something to one fly.
I get regular contact with him, how many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his exile, to visit him, to read to him - he is almost blind - and to treat him like a member of her family.
So those who do not forgive him until today that he was hard on them are clearly in the minority.
Most of the spatters are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them the world of music.
And that he was always a good, father-like teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but he was also a loving subject of respect, to which they are still looking up today and who they worship.
And please, once again, all that he has been accused of is education methods that were on the agenda at the time.
We can be glad to have overcome this time by now.
But it is most unjust to make a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother, a media scapegoat.
There is only too obvious the evil intention behind it.
Because the report that has just been published will relieve him.
Now the decency would be to let a 93-year-old man who has gained great merit and without the one outside of Bavaria and perhaps no one in Germany know the Regensburg Domspatzen at last in peace.
