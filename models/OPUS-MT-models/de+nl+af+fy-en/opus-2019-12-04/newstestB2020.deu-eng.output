Fire extinguished in French chemical work
The large fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is considered to be a particularly dangerous one, has been extinguished. This was reported by the Normandy Prefecture on Friday. The fire broke out the night on Thursday. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in use with about 200 extinguishing vehicles.
The fire could be stopped
Anrainers were called not to leave their houses. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday. The chemical plant on the banks of the Seine produces additives for lubricants. The factory belongs to the Lubrizol company of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso directive of the EU, which requires particularly strict safety requirements.
The chemical factory has already made headlines in the past - about when a leak removed the gas methanthiol and the environment smelled far after lazy eggs. In 2015, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil went into the city's waste water system after an operating accident.
Woman announces her job to look for 57 days after her missing dog
For two months a woman from Washington was looking for her missing dog - and announced her job for it. The seven-year-old Border Collie had left the hotel room during a short stay in Montana. 57 days were missing from the dog every trace - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got bad," said Carole King to "Daily Inter Lake." She and her husband had left HUNDIN Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Donner had put dog in a panic
In the hope that Katie could stay in the hotel somewhere, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says," She left about four, four and a half hours ago, "" Carole King remembers "Daily Inter Lake." When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie was immediately run out. A loud thunder probably panicked the dog.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings were looking for their beloved dog. But from days were weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," said Carole King to "Daily Inter Lake," who announced her job as a post office to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears fade"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King got a call: A man called and said that Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived, Katie had already disappeared. She was looking for the neighborhood and suddenly her dog was under a tree. "I only embraced her. I didn't want to let her go," he remembered, according to "Daily Inter Lake." The tears were flowing. The people stopped in their vehicles, went out and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew we had found her. "
losses in the Bundeswehr: machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday, September 27th, 2019
Six MG3-type machine guns are still missing.
In recent years, the Federal Army has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of weapons of ammunition, including three machine guns. The remains are unclear in most cases. The opposition speaks of a "frightening" extent.
In the Bundeswehr, weapons and ammunition are always disappearing - many of them have so far been spotless. Since the beginning of 2014, the force has recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 weapons parts and almost 20,000 shots of ammunition. This is the result of a list of the Federal Defence Ministry classified as a secret matter, which the German editorial network reports on.
According to the paper from the Office of Defense Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one weapon part and 3474 shot ammunition have been reappeared. The still missing weapons and parts of the weapons are, among other things, six machine guns of type MG3, eleven G3, four G36, six signal guns and two P8 guns. In addition, 30 weapons for machine guns of type MG3 are missing.
The extent of arms and ammunition losses in the Federal Army was "frightening," said the left-wing federal deputy Martina Renner. This was all the more true because, in the course of the investigation, little was found again. The left-wing politician spoke of a "poor balance sheet." Renner criticised that the list did not show whether the missing ammunition was the one found in the context of the investigation against the suspected federal force, Franco A., although he was recently convicted of the "property" of the French.
Oiltanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its adoption by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker was in motion and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was given as the target port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but it remained in Iranian waters at first. From the shipping company it was said that one wanted to wait for an official knowledge from Tehran.
On 19 July, the "Stena Impero" was accused by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in the Hormuz Sea Road of violating security regulations, but it was suspected that Iran would have responded to the controversial, temporary fixing of an Iranian oil tanker in front of Gibraltar, belonging to the United Kingdom.
The road of Hormuz is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the global oil exports is being shipped through the seashore. The tensions in the region have increased enormously over the past few months. Trade shipping has been brought into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers and drones.
Merkel commends the courage of people in the peaceful revolution
Chancellor Angela Merkel has appreciated the commitment of the people in the GDR, who have been on the road 30 years ago in the Peaceful Revolution. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens would have overtaken the then GDR regime, Merkel said at a ceremony of the Thuringian CDU Group on the upcoming day of German unity in Erfurt. The Chancellor, among other things, recalled the occupation of the Stasi headquarters. "State security was taken from the terror," she said.
Musk is looking for extradition record
Tesla's quarter may have a record. Despite the delivery tree, there were last losses in the electric car group.
New York.Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock exchange with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an e-mail published by the industry blog "Electrog," to Tesla employees.
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110000 orders, it was said in Musk's newsletter. The challenge was to bring the cars to the customers quickly. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
The investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of business with an increase of more than six percent. The course has not been so strong for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a good 95000 cars and thus reached its best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. In the current and next quarter, six-digit numbers have to be produced for this. Especially the most favourable Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Puzzle solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the big brain prevents people from ticking themselves. This was found by the scientists of the Humboldt University in Berlin with the help of experiments in rats, as they reported on Thursday night. Progress was also made on the question of why children are so strongly opposed to ticking, only to ask for more.
Finally, it has also been shown why the approach of a tickle hand alone is a cause of laughter before the touch. This is due to a deep layer in the big brain, which is already the cause of laughter in the expectation of the tickle.
According to previous research, rats react with "laughter" in the ultrasound area when they are tickled by humans. This "laughter" is mediated by the part of the large brain rind that serves the central processing of the haptic perception.
Laughing is suppressed during self-touching
So far, it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-contact and contact by others - that is why people can't tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers now found in the experiments at the rats that the laughter, as well as the activity of the area of the large brain, is being suppressed during a self-contact. This was also the case when living beings clean themselves up. During the foreign touch and the ticking by the scientists, however, the activity in the brain and the impulse had been increased.
But pass the self-touch and the touch by others at the same time, the laughter was also suppressed. This meant that the brain of the rat could not distinguish between the self-touch and the touch by others. The new findings suggested that people cannot tickle themselves because the self-touch activates a brake in the big brain.
The rats were also trained to tickle themselves. In the experiment they sometimes broke off this initiation early, showed escape behaviour or starvation. This ambivalence was equal to the behaviour of the children. The ambivalence of the tickle was a behavioral reaction that was the same in rats and people.
Disaster averted: large fire in French chemical works deleted
The large fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is considered to be particularly dangerous, has been extinguished. This was reported by the Normandy Prefecture of the news agency AFP on Friday. The fire had broken out the night to Thursday.
According to the authorities, no substances at risk of health have been released. The samples taken give no reason to worry, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said on Friday morning at a press conference. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in use with about 200 extinguishing vehicles.
Schools and kindergartens were closed
Residents were called not to leave their houses. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson criticised by his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first meeting in Parliament after the end of the Wednesday night period, but the Prime Minister is threatening to lead the country without agreements from the EU on 31 October if Brussels does not respond to his demands for changes to the Brexit Agreement, but it is not clear how he intends to achieve this.
The Prime Minister said about Cox, who had been working for the stay of Britain in the European Union, "The best way to honor the memory of Jo Cox and to reunite this country would have been to take off the EU." Cox was murdered by a right-wing extremist in 2016 during the referendum campaign.
Remembrance to the attacks of Oslo and Utöya is revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial to the victims is revealed in Norway on Saturday. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the iron roses) consists of about 1,000 iron rose illustrations. They remember the roses that thousands of people had spent in the days and weeks after the attacks before the cathedral in Oslo.
In the same place, the project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsruhe will be revealed - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and members of the victims. For the opening, among others, the Crown Prince Haakon and the Crown Princess Mette-Marit are expected.
On July 22, 2011, Anders Behring Breivik had first fired a car bomb in the Oslo government district and then shot dozens of participants of a holiday camp of the Youth Organisation of the Social Democratic Workers' Party. In total, 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran Releases British Tankers
The UN general debate did not solve the Iran conflict. But now there is a problem less. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran was able to stash into the sea again. It could be a puzzle in the peace plan of Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero," which has been held in Iran in the street of Hormus since mid-July, has returned to international waters. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk reported.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew are now going to Dubai for medical investigations, among other things, said the shipping company Erik Hånell. At noon the ship had left the Iranian waters. "It's nice that it's over," he said to the Swedish TV station SVT.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London called the establishment of the ship illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to affect the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said a communication on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guard had already been released in early September. The remaining 16 crew members were in good condition, said Hånell. They had acted professionally in view of the difficult and uplifting situation in the last ten weeks. The shipping company is now working to bring them back together with their families as soon as possible.
The British government, behind the establishment of the "Stena Impero," suspected a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar: a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was intended for Syria, had been put on the chain there at the beginning of July. According to the authorities, the delivery was against EU sanctions against the country of war in Syria. The evidence of the ship was received from the United States by the British.
Iran was talking about "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Suspects that it was a trade-off to get the "Stena Impero" released, London vehemently rejected.
The road of Hormus is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the world's oil exports are being shipped through the seashore. The tensions in the region have increased enormously over the past few months. Trade was brought into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers and drones.
The United States has left the international nuclear agreement in 2018, which was intended to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time to end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has been putting pressure on Iran to take massive economic sanctions against the country to force a more stringent and extended agreement to other areas.
The US is working on a coalition for the military protection of commercial ships in the region because of the dispute about the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia.
Iran's President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for security and peace in the street of Hormus at the UN General Assembly in New York. With the "Coalition of Hope" initiative, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf States and without foreign powers, wanted to ensure the security of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be a "war winner." In the light of the criminal duties imposed by US President Donald Trump on Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to redirect. Financial leaders of Asian companies, who are considering moving their production from China to another country, call India, in a UBS survey, one of the preferred alternatives. Of course, this does not only have to do with the uncertainties of the Chinese-American trade war. With a huge pool of young workers and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers, it seems to be a more important role in the global production chain in India.
But now India's focus has been on Trump's own. As a "Kingdom of Customs" of the White House, America has been calling the emerging country off the trade concessions for 2000 products at the beginning of June. The US is prohibitively imitating India's high customs duties and calling for better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and others.
On the world map of the trade wars, the riots with India are, of course, a side-view. In addition, America is looking at the world's largest democracy also through the security glasses. Delhi and Washington combine the concern about China's power claims in the Southern Ocean. Against this background, an army of American criminal duties against India is unlikely to take place. India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, who has just taken up a second five-year term, is therefore likely to be in security.
The problem is, however, in another place: the empirical-hardened thesis that open markets are accelerating economic development has a serious state in the Socialist Republic of India. Even under modes. His reform is mainly aimed at bureaucratic error, which has been suffocating every entrepreneurial spirit for too long in the multi-ethnic state. Companies now receive more rapid building permits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more effective insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions to liquidate seemingly high-debt companies more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic point of view, in India, much has turned to the better. However, in trade policy this does not apply. This is an incentive to protect internationally little competitive companies from foreign suppliers, the national conservative government even created new barriers.
In the West, Modi is the nimbus of the energetic reformer, who has been radically renewed in his country. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic Prime Minister knows only too well what the vocabulary of Western managers is like. But at the heart of the "India First" lawyer never went from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to dispose of anachronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition. Businesses who survive thanks to the scaffolding of their industries, are among the leaders of this national party and the people of the state.
Formation of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
According to a report, former French President Jacques Chirac will be buried in Paris next week. The former head of state will be buried in the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital on Monday, the news agency AFP, calling on the Chirac family. The funeral will take place in the close family circle. A public funeral ceremony was scheduled for Sunday in the Paris Invalidendom cemetery, as the media reported.
The goal of the competitors is: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Cup of Athletics
The top of the world was already in the long run, when the Khalifa International Stadium was being warmed down. In the first run of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to fluctuate dangerously. He was not able to hold himself on his feet well 300 metres before the target, but he was in an unhealthy position, when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly stopped him and he was supporting the last half-stage-round goal. The forces were reaching both, but the target was not enough to stop the current scene.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same thing," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he was completely unexpectedly drawing the attention of the journalists gathered. He was just shy, he didn't want to talk about his heroism at all. After all, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he had noticed that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help one of the sufferers. And anyway, he would be proud to represent his country that was invited to the World Cup. In normal circumstances he should not have even started. "That's why he was proud of my country."
He did this in the evening with strength - and much more intense than he would have thought. Because this heroine will remain in memory. In the end, Dabo even left his competitors Busby in the target and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, about five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this advance. It had all been used in the end, because the Busby, who was only in a great deal of help, was disqualified by the World Light Athletics Association at the end.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies in Lisbon, had started to set up a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, he was still disappointed: "I wanted to run 17: 55 minutes. I was already under 18 minutes." However, only in the course of training, the best times do not count.
Millions of Mash: Egyptians prepare for wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been strengthened in advance of possible government-critical protests. In the centre of Cairo there was an increased police presence on Friday. Several subway stations were closed, roads around the central Tahrir square were closed.
In recent days, the police have strengthened their road controls and partially searched the mobile phones of pedestrians on news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds were arrested according to two non-governmental organisations.
Answers of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, it was in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura that there had been no protests with hundreds of participants. They were directed against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who accused the critic of corruption and mismanagement. Such an open protest against the political leadership had not been in Egypt for years. The Egyptian architect and actor Mohammed Ali, who was living in the Spanish exile, who launched the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, has today called for a "million marches" in central places in the country, but he has called on a young army for the "of the people of the country," but he also called on a "the young people of the people who are not to come to the army."
The number of arrests in the context of the protests continued to increase, according to two groups of observers. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) had more than 1,570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. These figures were not confirmed at first. The government confirmed and did not comment on the figures.
Accidental arrests
Many people were "arbitrarily arrested," "only because they were" in the wrong place at the wrong time, "said HRW, by calling on lawyers, who were arrested. According to their lawyers, the allegations against the arrested are also arbitrary passers, from" dissemination of false information "to membership of a" terrorist association. "In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, they questioned and searched security forces in uniform, but also in civil clothing, according to HRW information.
HRW also criticised the censorship in the North African country. Consequently, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online dealers: Shipping traders should be able to donate more easily
Many back-sent packages are lost goods for online dealers. Around 20 million retours land on the trash. But there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online traders like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate back-handed products instead of destroying them.
Although it was not possible to free companies from the VAT on donations of goods, the Ministry explained a question of the Green Bundestag group, about which the newspapers of the Funke media group reported on Friday, but traders could set the market value of the unselling returns so low that they would have to pay no or little turnover tax.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg found that in order orders on the Internet, the federal citizens sent back every sixth package. About four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - then ended up in the trash. They would also cost the companies, according to the current legal situation, because the financial authorities are assessing material donations like a turnover that then comes with turnover tax.
Green Group Commissioner Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to make it clear by a decision that companies can assess non-sales products and donate them free of charge to non-profit organisations. Companies should be able to rely on not being punished for donations, not only for online trade, but also for other business from the model to the construction market.
Banksy art to auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament," is to be auctioned soon.
For Branczik, Banksys's work underlines "the reformation of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world into the basic attitude of animals and tribes." From Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it is auctioned on 3 October. It is estimated to be 1.5 to 2 million euros.
The work was first exhibited in the Museum of Bristol in the South West of Great Britain in 2009, where Banksy lives. This year the artist had again exhibited the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29. On this occasion, the work, which was formerly called "Question Time," was renamed "Devolved Parliament" ("Deleted Parliament").
The picture could change the owner for a million.
Finally, on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, at the first meeting of the House of Commons after the lifting of a forced break by the Supreme Court by the Supreme Court, had made a hard exchange of battle with the opposition. Johnson wants to make the Brexit that has been postponed twice on October 31, if necessary, without any agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has been involved in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the south-east of England he painted a picture that is a man who is breaking a star of the European flag with a chisel. The work sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors every day when entering the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
The violent verbal attacks by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit's opponents in Parliament do not, in his view, contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the campaign before the Brexit referendum in 2016, the current controversy is a "walk in the park," said Dominic Cummings at a book show on Friday. "We will enjoy this. We will leave the EU and we will win."
Johnson had attacked Brexit's opponents in Parliament hard in the past few days and accused them of "betrayal" to the people, among other things, and allegations that he could put the Members at risk because they could be the target of murder threats, he took off as "Humbug."
Cummings said that the only way to get back to rest is if the Members finally respect the British 's decision to leave the EU, and it is not surprising that people were upset that Britain had not yet resigned from the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the charged mood on Friday, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint. "We should speak with respect," said a statement. "And we should also listen."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for Uno-intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict at his first appearance before the Uno General Assembly.
Otherwise, a new war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said on Friday at the Uno-General debate in New York. "If this goes bad, you hope for the best, but are prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have been responsible for Kashmir. "You should have prevented it."
India and Pakistan have had three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers control a part of Kashmir, another part of China. At the beginning of August, India had withdrawn the status of autonomy from the Indian Kashmir region and thus increased the tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo are calling for the fall of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government is responding to the current protests in Egypt with a hard hand. It has been shooting at the population with a sharp munitions, more than 2000 prisoners in the prisons of the 60,000 political prisoners who are already sitting there. Protesting has never been safe in Egypt. But since the takeover of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus has done everything in its power to avoid a scenario like at the time of the Arab Spring.
But one of the reasons for the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation. Poverty, the lack of prospects and the feeling of being suffocated by the own government drove millions into the road. And this is a problem that the regime of el-Sisi does not get under control, no matter how hard it is to fight opponents. The situation has even deteriorated.
Today, every third party lives in Egypt below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. If you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, you have to decide who it is: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the repression but also the largest economic player. The military is building roads, houses, football stadiums, food and much more. That was already before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, even the dilemma is a lot of water in the world, if there is a lot of problems in the world.
Tüv-tests in the terminal: BER-Chef: No more "showstoppers" for city airport
Two months have been checked to see if the complex plant braid works in conjunction with the BER fire protection system. The operators are satisfied with the process, but the tüv is not yet finished at the BER.
After large-scale Tüv tests at the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators have confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is for sure, said Rauer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control body.
The airport manager Engelbert Litke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed examination, but also said that there were still shortcomings in the terminal. "We have many detailed issues, but we do not have a real showstop." He assured that the schedule until the start-up was still buffer.
However, there is evidence that the time reserve is no longer to be too large. The notice of termination is to be submitted to the Bauamt in the course of the first quarter of 2020, which was scheduled for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of power cables still need to be fixed, and the Tüv wants to examine them until February. "In order to create the conditions for the start-up of the operation, it is necessary to continue to work hard to deal with the shortcomings," said a written communication.
Litke Daldrop said in many cases it is about missing evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all the divers on which the cable tracks are hanging. The airport manager expects this to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal is not yet working satisfactorily. The problems had already led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time, it is about smoke stimulants that go down in a fire like a screen so that the smoke does not spread out. They go too far. 36 engines must therefore be replaced and then there will be new tests with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other building defects as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it should start operating in 2011. Since the beginning of 2006, the costs have increased from two billion to about 6.5 billion euros expected to be opened next year.
Since the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, the authorities are planning to expand the airport. Therefore, it is to be done in a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as the chairman of the Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new Managing Director. Financial Chief Heike Fölster is moving to the German Railway at the end of the year, Chief of Staff Manfred Bobke-von Camen is retiring next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She has set the airport finances on firm feet.
Chemnitz: Machines for drugs blown up - police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and he had to blow up a lot of machines in the Chemnitz city area! Now the perpetrator is finally in jail!
Over the past two years, the number of cigarette and parking ticket vending machines in Chemnitz and the region has increased significantly.
After two detonations at the end of May, the police took a 33-year-old German on Bu aerrgerstraße and on Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesperson Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation into the occurrence of explosive explosions in the crime unit with a particularly serious case of theft, which was carried out by the Chemnitzer criminal police, this suspicion was not only raised against the 33-year-old."
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed to a total of eight actions.
The police spokesman: "With the prey, he apparently financed his beta-drug abyss." The bomber alone had blown up parking ticket machines on the Bu-rgerstraße four times between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019.
The total damage caused is at least EUR 60 000!
The machine bomber is now in custody, and the police investigation against him is continuing.
It can be thought that he was also responsible for further machine explosions in Chemnitz and neighbouring districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is changing its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the middle of the prize campaign with cheap flights such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA takes over "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna," confirmed on Friday a press speaker from Austrian Airlines to the APA. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" had reported on this.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa low-cost airliner Eurowings is de facto disbanded. Of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft, four remain in Vienna. This will take over the AUA from January 2020 in the "Wetlease," including Eurowings staff. In the future, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Salzburg, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter machines to holiday destinations. The routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna is integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, said the speaker. The flight times are to be coordinated on connection flights. The aim was to strengthen the Vienna hub and to develop the decentralised traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serve as a "production company" for the group's sister AUA. For example, Barcelona and Rome would be operated with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device. Although the on-board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight crew members are from Eurowings. The Eurowings flights launched under the AUA flight number are no longer in Terminal 1, but in the same way as the AUA in Terminal 3.
After the Niki-Pleite airport, a price fight was launched at the airport of Vienna. The airport's daughter, Laudamotion, announced that the fleet would be increased to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish cheap plane will send four Ryanair machines, including crews, to Vienna, also in the so-called "wetlease," which the union criticised as a byway structure to the collective agreement.
The Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary's statement that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years, replied on Friday's AUA Executive Board Andreas Otto: "We will remain at the location number one in five, six or ten years."
Queen granddaughter Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four are married. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: In the Italian holidays in the beginning of the month Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is supposed to have stopped around the hand of his friend Princess Beatrice (31). This was announced by the palace on Thursday.
"We are extremely pleased to be able to announce our engagement. We are both so happy to start this adventure together and can hardly wait to be actually married," the couple, which has been together since October 2018, reported in the official communication.
And further: "We share so many similar interests and values, and we know that this will help us very much in the coming years full of love and happiness."
Sister Eugenie clipped the pictures
The official engagement photos have taken their sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also published on their Instagram account.
A generous festival
The wedding is due to take place in 2020. More information about date, place and everything else will be announced to the palace in the coming months.
But it is certain that the marriage of the number nine of the British succession and the real estate mogul will be a similar celebration to the wedding of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy nutrition - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really causes a heart weakness or an infarction? Hamburg researchers now want to look at the inheritance of 9000 healthy and sick people.
The analysis of the heritage of 9000 people means that Hamburg and Swiss scientists want to find out more about the causes of cardiovascular diseases.
The research project was the largest of this kind in the German-speaking area, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühlne Foundation supports the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the High-Mountain Hospital Davos, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy nutrition are one of the main factors affecting cardiovascular disease. Genetic factors determine the risk. But the interaction between genes and external influences is not known enough. Now the scientists want to compare the complete inheritance of 8000 healthy people with that of 1000 former patients at the university heart and vascular center at the UKE.
At present, more than 4000 of the about 20,000 relevant human genes have known possible disease-related changes in DNA - so-called mutations - were reported by the clinic. Every year, about 200 would be added.
The aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart weakness and heart attacks. The data could also be useful in the research of other popular diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, head of the university heart and vascular centre. New findings on the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as on cancer are possible.
The Chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there is a strong will to use the data also for the research of other diseases. The clinic of the Foundation in Davos has so far dealt with allergies. Now, on the medical campus there, a center for cardiovascular precision medicine was to be created and a professor for bioinformatics was to be created. In order to justify his commitment, the logistics manager in Switzerland said that he had been in the open heart three years ago in Hamburg and was to be very grateful.
The bioprobes of the healthy participants are from hamburgers who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study." With 45,000 subjects, this is the largest local health study in the world, according to the clinic. In the case of the inheritance decryption, the scientists were strictly aware of the protection of the anonymised data. It is about a petabyte (1000 terabyte) of data, said Holger Moch of the University Hospital Zurich.
Today, according to UKE, the property of a person can be decrypted within 24 hours. The pure cost of this is 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, has still cost several hundred million euros. The study is to start on 1 October, all 9000 samples are to be analysed by the end of 2020.
Nigerian police free hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, the police have released more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Coran School. According to evidence from residents, security forces searched the school in the North Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the still minor victims, as police speakers Yakubu Sabo reported. "The victims were abused. Some of them said they were raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys were held under the pretext of being taught and "improved" in the Koran. Indeed, the shooters were held by their teachers under "most disgraceful and inhumane conditions," Sabo said. About a hundred students, including children of the age of nine, were chained in a small room.
According to the information, the Coran School had been in existence for about ten years. Residents would have made the authorities aware of repeated irregularities in the institution. Parents would have been shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Coran School, said Sabo. They would have known nothing about the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to the police.
In the majority of the Muslim north of Nigeria there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often poor state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN refugee aid agency, more than 40,000 people have fled the border to the neighbouring state of Niger over the past ten months.
Chained and tortured: Nigerian police liberate 400 children from school
Police officers in a school in the north of Nigeria have freed almost 400 students from appalling conditions. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that indicate torture," said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
The children were discovered there on Thursday after a hint in an Islamic-shaped school, where the conditions were "unworthy" and the officials arrested the head of the school and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all of them boys, were kept at their school like slaves and put on chains. Some were sexually abused. TV pictures showed the maimed and injured students in a clearly bad health condition.
World Football Election: Further allegations after Messis and Klops Kür
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the World Football Association is awarded the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honor and thus the record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the World Football election, other countries have been accused of the Fifa. Egypt has not been evaluated at all - with a curious reason.
A lot of the Fifa has proved to be offensive in recent years: the World Cup fortresses, dubious plans of its President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. However, the Fifa World Football election has not been suspected of being unclean until now - if one does not consider that the voting-right national trainer and national team masters of the member organisations often vote for sympathy rather than objective opinion.
But after Nicaragua's captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies are now emerging: Egypt is complaining that the voices of national coach Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible vote list.
The Fifa apologizes to the fact that "the signatures on the electoral forms were given in capital letters and therefore were not valid." The Egyptian Federation has been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without answer.
Sudan's coach also surprised
Also from Sudan there is a cry about the election. While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally considered: with Lionel Messi in place one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. However, according to Fifa, the vote had been taken in the same way, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese association.
In his case, he was suspected that the Nicaraguan Football Association would simply vote in his name. "I did not vote for the # TheBest2019 Awards. All the details of my voice are wrong, thank you."
From the association came now the message: right, but of course no intention. The completed electoral documents were "miserably" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaragua selection, said in a communication from the association. However, the second captain Manuel Rosas had actually chosen. "We take responsibility for the administrative error," it said in the communication. Both Rosas and team trainer Henry Duarte would have voted for Messi, "as it is in the official list of the FIFA."
The other cases are now being examined by the Fifa in an investigation, but stress that the election process was supervised externally by the PriceWaterhouseCoopers consulting company. As long as Lionel Messi remains undisputed winner of the world football election - and Jürgen Klopp world coach of the year.
Ukraine affair: High-ranking Republicans speak out for official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have openly expressed their support for an official investigation against the US president and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican governor of the U.S. state of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are being established." He wanted to know more about the Whistleblower affair before action is taken. An impediment procedure can lead to the President's resignation.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which had shown that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selensky in a phone call to investigate the activities of the democratic presidential candidate and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine. Scott said that Trump had been watching the "for years."
The Republicans have so far held back with criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair, but few have shown displeasure. Scott's statements are now a first sign of this in Trump's party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already turned several times against Trump's policy, for example against the easing of environmental legislation and the tightening of immigration rules.
As another high-ranking Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also called for the investigation. "It is a deeply disturbing situation," said Baker. "The right approach and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and to get to the bottom of it."
Scott and Baker, as the governor of US states, have no formal participation in the proceedings against Trump, which is decided in the Congress. Their statements are therefore particularly symbolic. However, the first Republicans' senators have made a critical statement about the situation. In the middle of Romney, who represents the state of Utah in the second Chamber of Parliament, said that the case is "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing." US media also report that the Republicans have the first cracks in the world.
The affair could lead to the opening of an arrest procedure against Trump, and the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation to this effect, and they are accusing him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the withdrawal procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could make a so-called impediment. However, the decision to take a real withdrawal of office is in the Senate where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far no US President has been removed by an impediment procedure of the Office.
Were there torturers on the board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, they are supposed to have raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she had unlawfully taken on board the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees. After serious protests and international criticism - also by Austria's President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was reinstated after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now, new serious accusations against Rackete are being made. Three men who are being accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with the "Sea Watch 3." The suspects have been caught in a recording agent in Messina (Sicily) after migrants had recognized their pests in Italy. "We cannot rule out this, but we have no secure information about it," said "Sea Watch" spokesman Ruben Neugebauer of the German press agency.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country were raped, tortured and even killed. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically bullied and subjected to atrocities - through repeated and permanent physical violence," said the communication.
NGOs and aid organisations now point out that they cannot know exactly who is on the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports," said Neubauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why people are fleeing Libya. It is therefore very likely that the perpetrators are also on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this is done."
Italy's former Minister of the Interior, Matteo Salvini, immediately requested an apology from Rackete, who is still being found in Italy for aid for illegal immigration.
Musk is looking for extradition record at Tesla
Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock exchange with the prospect of new record numbers.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an e-mail published by the industry blog "Electrog" to Tesla employees.
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it was said in Musk's newsletter. The challenge was to bring the cars to the customers quickly. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
The investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of business with an increase of more than six percent. The course has not been so strong for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered over 95,000 cars and thus reached its top value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. In the current and next quarter, six-digit numbers have to be produced for this. Especially the most favourable Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
US budget dispute: Once again, only one bridge financing
The new financial year will start in the US on 1 October without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the American Congress and President Donald Trump agreed on an increase in the expenditure ceilings for the financial years 2020 and 2021 in August, the United States is once again in front of the new fiscal year beginning on 1 October, without spending plans. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision, a shutdown would have occurred on Monday at midnight, a part of the federal administration. President Trump still has to put the decision into effect.
Shutdown Abused
For the time being, the Federal Government is now being financed at the level and in accordance with the priorities of the expenditure plans for the financial year 2019, which will end on Monday, because Congress has not been able to agree on the 12 expenditure laws that allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities, and the Federal Government cannot, for the time being, benefit from the expenditure framework extended from 1.3 million to 1.4 million dollars for the new financial year.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, but the spending laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Senate dominated by the Republicans. Conversely, the Senate has also more or less prepared ten of the twelve spending plans, which are hardly majority able.
In the Senate, the Republicans seem to be trying to force $12 billion for the construction of walls, one of the major priorities of President Trump. The Democrats are interfering with the construction plans and their financing, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute about the construction of walls had already escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
At the wall building the spirits separate
At present, it is unclear how the parties want to get closer to this issue. More likely than an agreement on all 12 spending laws over the next seven weeks, an extension of the transitional financing beyond 21 November is also not excluded.
Against the background of the continued inability of the Congress to agree on the 12 spending laws in time, and the associated risk of a shutdown gain ideas for the automation of the process of popularity. Presentation S. 1877 on the prevention of shutdowns would automatically continue the financing of the federal administration at the previous year's level, stop the travel activities of the parliamentarians and keep their wages down until the new annual expenditure plans were presented.
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilization will also be open to single women and lesbians in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill that allows all women to use in vitro fertilization, which is likely to increase the demand for anonymous seed donations.
The presentation still needs the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate critics in the right camp had warned that in the future many "children without a father" could grow up. The French Episcopal Conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core part of a Bioethics law that defended Health Minister Agnès Buzyn as a "chance" for society. It represents the modern family in which children with only one parent or with homosexual parents are present. According to her idea, the costs of artificial fertilization for all women are to be borne by social security.
Fruit with sperm from dead husband further prohibited
The National Assembly, on the other hand, rejected an amendment which would give widows access to the sperm of their dead husband for artificial fertilization. In Belgium, Spain and the UK, artificial fertilization "post-mortem" is allowed. In the past, in Germany, there have been cases in which women in vain complained of the release of the sperm of a deceased person. The opponents of the provocation in Paris argued that such a child would have a "particularly serious fate."
Many members of the government party La République en Marche (The Republic on the move, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition, on the other hand, expressed their support for artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow would be imposed on a "double mourning" if their husband's death had not met her child's wish.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair for a widow to be able to be fertilized in the future with the sperm of an unknown, but not with that of his own partner.
So far, artificial fertilization in France is only allowed heterosexual couples that cannot bear children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that the parenting motherhood will continue to be prohibited.
In Germany, the artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - yet it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Compensation for climate: calls for flight for Unis become louder
A lot is being flown to the universities, and that's why the country wants to have a climate response there in the future, and the rectors say they have no money for it, but now they are also under internal pressure.
The universities should also be limited in flying. Photo: dpa / Julian Stratenschulte
The discussion on a climate change issue on flights from universities and universities, which was postponed before the summer break, is now in motion. After the National Rector Conference had skeptically responded to a corresponding advance from the Green-Black Coalition, the plans are being supported by the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral countries of six Baden-Württemberg universities and a pedagogical university for compensation of service flights, which was the first step in the process of being "urgent," at the same time, there must be a broad debate on the feasibility of flights, it is said that the decision on the matter is still in the Green Paper is not yet in the Green Paper.
Russia reappoints North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB, the prisoners were supposed to have been illegally fishing in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time, there was a change of shot between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and one North Korean were injured, the fisherman later suffered his serious injuries. But this time there were no injuries, it was said.
The Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages. The North Korean fishermen were therefore on the road to Russian territorial waters, where the coast guard of Russia, according to its own information, is going to patrol to protect its marine biological resources.
30,000 squid confiscated
During the re-checks, 30,000 squid were discovered and confiscated on the boats. In addition, the information was confiscated after three fishing and two motor boats and brought to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok.
Russia's fishing authority had also not issued a fishing licence to the North Koreans this year following complaints by local entrepreneurs. According to thousands of fishermen from North Korea, the media have already been arrested there this year.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained of high ecological damage by North Korean fishermen. They were fishing with narrow-scale synthetic networks banned in Russia. These would also bring small living beings out of the sea. Moreover, the networks would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to be replaced.
In the future, only 18,000 more: USA is reducing asylum ceiling
The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country in the world is shutting down against those seeking protection: As the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Washington confirms, the ceiling for the legal occupation of refugees will be further reduced, and in the future, the most likely are the ones to receive threatened believers and Iraqi asylum.
The US government wants to reduce again the already historically low limit for the reception of new refugees. In the 2020 marketing year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people will be left in the country, as the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. In the almost completed marketing year, the limit is still around 30,000 people.
The government of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the willingness to take in for people from all over the world in recent years. Under the predecessor government of Barack Obama, much higher reception limits had been achieved.
The oiled ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the US refugee programme in 1980. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the US "the most merciful and generous nation in history," a wording that strongly recalls the language used by the President-in-Office of the United States.
A "responsible approach" to refugees is aimed at allowing refugees to return to their home countries to help with the reconstruction, Trump explained. For his hard course in migration policy, he is given a lot of support from supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
A major point of dispute is the border with Mexico that wants to seal Trump. To finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the National Emergency. Whether there is a temporal link between the current measure and the current domestic policy developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selensky affair and a possible threat of withdrawal of office.
According to the Foreign Office, the US government intends to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and have thus been in danger, as shown by the Foreign Ministry's statement. However, from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be received.
The US wants to ensure that people from this "northern triangle" of Central America, in particular, apply for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has only signed migration agreements with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras to curb immigration at the US South border to Mexico.
Court orders the release of Orang-Utan from Zoo
An orangutan female has been transferred to a human apes collection station in the United States at the request of the Argentine justice from the former Buenos Aires Zoo. Sandra, born in 1986 in the Rostocker Zoo, was granted the rights of a "non-human person," therefore their release was mandatory. The animal was taken on Thursday night by direct flight to Dallas - but not as a passenger, but in the cargo room, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez said.
As the 53 kilograms of heavy human effin is not able to adapt to life in the wilderness, she is to live in the future in the open air of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 more orangutans and 31 chimpanzees, among them "Bubbles," former pet of Popstar Michael Jackson. However, before entering Florida, "Sandra" has to experience a 40-day quarantine in Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the U.S. state of Kansas.
After her birth in Rostock, "Sandra" spent a few years in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before being moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process of "Sandra" fundamental rights, which was intensified by animal protectors in 2014, helped to transform the Buenos Aires Zoo into an eco-park. By 2023, a research and education site is to be created there to preserve biodiversity.
Record for Swiss Extrembergsteiger: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The Extrembergsteiger Dani Arnold has a new Husarenrei in the Italian Alps at the almost 3000-metre-high great interest rate.
Without net, double ground or other tools, the Swiss forced the 550 m high north wall of the Great Zinne in a new record time.
Dressed with jeans, t-shirt and only supported by absolute dizziness, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the rise. He thus undercut the old best mark by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder at the Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European northern walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
The US sports product manufacturer Nike has recorded a clear profit plus despite the trade conflict with China. The net profit in the past quarter increased to $1.4 billion (just under €1.3 billion). This is 25 percent more than in the previous year, as the group reported on Tuesday. The reason for this is the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct," with which the adidas competitor directly turns to its customers online.
The sales increased to $10.7 billion in the three-month period until the end of August. The most powerful of the sales of Nike were in China with an increase of 22 percent. Thus, the Beaverton Group in the U.S. state of Oregon benefited from its approach to direct to consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Financial Director Andy Campion announced that Nike would continue to drive the "digital transformation" of the sports product manufacturer with strategic investment and thus increase its competitive advantage. Investors were pleased to respond to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sports product manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Life-long stadium ban on racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football professional Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the association from the Italian capital has imposed a life-long ban on a fan. The defender Jesus from Brazil was disgraced by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and asked his club to take action. "@ officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. # NoToRacism. Pride to be who I am," wrote the 28-year-old who has been playing with AS since 2016.
The club responded on late Thursday. He reported the fan's account to Instagram and the police. Moreover, the Roma supporters were never allowed to visit a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. The Italian fans regularly scandal racist attacks against black players of rival teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sport. In Italy the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. You have to identify and throw those responsible out of the stages," Fifa President Gianni Infantino said on the weekend. The occasion of the statement was racist songs at the first league game between Atalanta Bergamo and the AC Florence on Sunday.
But there were also discussions about the followers of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities have now made 38 ranting fans of record masters Juventus Turin with no stadium. Four of them are expected to no longer enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police informed them. The others are subject to bans of four to seven years.
The fans are associated with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of the ultra-fishing forces in the area of Juventus. The twelve are accused, among other things, of severe blackmail, money laundering and private violence. The club had launched the investigation with an ad last year.
The Ultra leaders are supposed to be behind the black trade in tickets after Italian media reports. They would have "military control" the ticket trade for the fan curve and would have blackmailed Juventus employees to get more favourable cards.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennia are narcissistic, generation Z is political - whole years are taken up with bold names. If you look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the particular sense of life of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" This call officially started on September 21 the crab catch at Gucheng Lake in Gaochun, which also opened the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Department of Public Relations of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which is the southern outreach of Nanjing in the province of Jiangsu, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "slow city" in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "slow city" movement. The city has the ideal ecological conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields." The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
The people of Gaochun have already started to grow crab in the early 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has developed into a major industry that has provided high income and has become an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. Over the past few years, Gaochun has actively sought to promote a large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab farming and technical-based crab farming, and the city has taken care of promoting more efficiency in agriculture and farmers' incomes.
In recent years, Gaochun has been preparing a reform on the "distribution of power, optimisation of administration and government services" and with care the service network for "permits under one roof, a team for law enforcement, a network for services, a platform for lending," which aims to fully optimize the environment for permits, services and development.
Gaochun is fully exploiting the advantages given on the ground by connecting to the southern Jiangsu and the southern Anhui and taking advantage of the development zone and its position as an international "slow city" as a guide to the development of intelligent high-end production companies, companies for biomedical and medical technology, for energy storage and environmental protection, from the cultural and health sectors, as well as from organic farming, which are leading in the "3 + 2" area. At the same time, Gaochun has been able to promote the development of a national, all the areas of tourism and the environment, "and the development of the public services of the" high quality of the tourism sector, "and the environment.
Conflict between Iran and USA: Ruhani speaks of the end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
After his return from the UN General Assembly, Iranian President Hassan Ruhani spoke of an alleged US offer to abolish sanctions. The United States would have envisaged an end to all sanctions in return for talks with the Tehran leadership, Ruhani said on his official website.
However, US President Donald Trump opposed the Iranian counterpart on Twitter: "Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there was a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the situation as follows: Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron have been present in New York and have called for a meeting to take place. "And America says that I am lifting the sanctions," added Ruhani. The type of sanctions that should be terminated has been discussed. "And they have clearly said that we are lifting all sanctions."
However, this advance had not been made in an acceptable way, criticised Ruhani. No one could predict the outcome of negotiations in view of the current criminal measures and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure."
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York. The background was the hope of Europeans to save the nuclear agreement negotiated with Russia and China, which is to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France's President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel on the edge of the UN General Assembly, had expressed the hope that Ruhani would meet with US President Donald Trump.
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - Almost 200 aftershocks
After the Western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within the shortest time, the fear of a disaster is growing. 34 people were injured at the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake on the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, the Turkish Vice President Fuat Octai said on Friday. The concern for a disaster is growing.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were therefore damaged. The earthquake of strength 5.8 had shaken the Marmararegion in front of Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the millions of metropolis. Now the government wanted to use a Commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Octai announced.
In the last 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is always ignored. Every year, poorly built homes collapse - among other things, made murmur by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
City planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open areas, which were registered in the centre as a refuge, have long been cultivated. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük-Bebens in August the building engineering chamber of Istanbul had warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not to be found to be unearthed.
The epicenter of the earthquake of Thursday was in the Marmarameer in front of the district of Silivri and in about seven kilometres depth, as the Civil Protection Authority told Afad. A smaller afterquake caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
The Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu told on Twitter, injured or damaged had not been reported at first. The state-sender TRT showed people who ran out of the houses in panic. Students were brought out of the buildings for security reasons in the district of Silivri. Some students wept as on pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable to the earthquake. Under the Marmaram, there is a section of the so-called North-American disorder that marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolic Earth. Turkey is always shaken by earthquakes. One of the most deadly was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time, more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of strength could threaten 7.1 to 7.4, but when it comes to the earthquake, it is unclear. At the earthquake on Thursday it met again the west of the country and Istanbul.
Companies design emergency plans, so-called go-bags have been packed with everything necessary next to door doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth is waving. When the next big quake comes, it is unclear.
After his return from New York, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered slight damage. Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul disaster coordination centre (Akom). According to him, two minarets of mosques collapsed into the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer.
Warning against quake in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users of panic report. Buildings were waving. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It had been more severe than that of Tuesday, a user writes. The head of the Turkish Red Half-Moon, Kerem Clinic, warned about a post-quake via Twitter. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to official information, the time of the quake is given at 1.59 p.m. (local time). Only a few minutes after the first quake, according to CNN Turkey, there was a quake, which was given at a strength of 4.0 on the judge scale.
Only on Tuesday had an earthquake of strength 4.6 shook the Turkish Marmararegion - it was to be felt until Istanbul. Also its epicenter was located in the Marmarameer west of the million metropolis, the Afad Civil Protection Authority announced on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a serious earthquake.
Researchers assume that there may be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul sooner or later - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually unload - and cause massive damage.
Strawberry researcher Sükru Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a warning. It was more likely, he said to CNN Turk. "These could be the signs of a larger earthquake," says Ersoy to the transmitter. "Sooner or later the big quake will also come."
A few weeks ago there had been an incident - the earthquake caused great concern also in Istanbul. In Albania there had also been a severe earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured. This year also on Lake Constance the earth had trembled.
Parliament: New ignition in Ukraine affair
Two brilliant documents provide new explosives in the Ukraine affair for the possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible withdrawal process, the US Democrats see themselves strengthened: the complaint of Trump and his controversial phone with the Ukrainian President, filed by an anonymous notifier, and he also doubted the credibility of the Whistleblower.
USA: United Airlines' passenger locked in the toilet - plane redirected
Because a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a flight from United Airlines has been redirected. The toilet door was blocked during the flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco, the airline reported according to the US media.
At an unscheduled port of call on Wednesday night (local time) in Denver, the woman could finally be released from the tight cabin. About an hour she was locked in it, US media wrote on behalf of other passengers. On the way to San Francisco, the passengers had to change the machine.
In a video spread on the Internet, which is supposed to come from flight 1554 according to the US media, it can be seen that several people are trying to free the woman. "We are currently working to open the door, ma'am. We are getting you out soon, okay?" says a man in it. The airline apologized to all passengers. The first was whether the woman was getting compensation.
The cockroach: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all the Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The Transformation," the British success author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book on Brexit Chaos in the UK.
The novel "The Cockroach" (original: "The Cockroach") will appear in German on November 27, the Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) announced. This is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sats," who was ignored or hated in his former life, but is now the most powerful man in the world. He sees it as his mission to implement the will of the people in fact, and is wild to be stopped by nothing and no one.
McEwan was quoted in the words: "When Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment when ministers are shameless as the Soviet leaders once were, when Brexiteers in high positions are begging for the disaster of a no-deal - then a writer has to ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to this: write." McEwan had only appeared in the spring of the novel "machines like me" about artificial intelligence.
Kafka's first story, published in 1915, is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "turned into an enormous insanity," is gradually excluded from family and society, and finally goes down. "Ian McEwan is bowing down to Kafka to describe a world that is in the head," said the Diogenes Verlag.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria's railway infrastructure
11.200 wagons in Austria and Hungary get whisper brakes to reduce noise from freight trains. Furthermore, sections of the rail connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are modernized and electrified.
According to the EU Authority, this will make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions, from the EU's Connecting Europe Facility Infrastructure Summit.
Thomas Cook: All trips to October 31 cancelled
The German tour operator Thomas Cook cancelled all travel until October 31, 2019, one day after his application for insolvency. "For insolvency reasons," the company announced on Thursday night.
This also concerns bookings of Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which have already been paid or fully paid. As is the case with travel with start from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In consultation with the insolvency insurance company the further procedure was examined, it was said.
Thomas Cook in Germany had been in the sock of the British parent group's failure and had filed an application for insolvency on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann travel, Öger Tours and Bucher travel, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurance company wants to transfer money to hotels from now on
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels abroad that still host Thomas Cook vacations are to receive money from the Zurich insurance company. According to Zurich, the payments to the hotels are subject to the condition that the vacationers are no longer invited to make extra payments.
Based on the booking information and without the submission of separate invoices, the hotels in the holiday resorts are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesperson of the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and provided that Thomas Cook travellers from these hotels are not immediately asked to pay individual hotel bills or otherwise forced to pay hotel bills," said Mr Bernd Engelien.
The insurance has therefore responded to reports from hotel guests who, according to their own information, had been forced to pay their own accommodation on the ground. Some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had strongly criticised this.
How many hotels are affected, on Friday the insolvent travel provider is agreed, said the insurance spokesman. According to Thursday, 70 000 Thomas Cook packages were still on the way from Germany. Zurich Germany has secured the holiday and return of Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the now announced payments to hotels by Zurich insurance only help the travellers who are still on the road. For Thomas Cook customers who want to go on holiday, it looks bad. On late Thursday evening the company announced that all travel until October 31 would be cancelled. This also applies to those bookings that are already paid.
As it is about travel with start from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In agreement with the insolvency insurance the further procedure was examined, it was said. In principle, insurance is also responsible for these cases Zurich. The sale of new travel is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurance company Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could be informed on the Kaera website about the possibilities of reimbursement of the travel price and make their claims through a web form.
Prince Harry destroys springmine in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry has continued the commitment of Lady Diana. In Africa, he is now walking directly on the trail of his mother.
The British Prince Harry, dressed with a blue splinter-protection vest, has burned and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola.
Almost a camp of the British Halo Trust at the village of Dirico, on Friday morning before running TV cameras, he created the ignition circuit. At a safe distance, the explosive body in the Savannah landscape exploded without damage. Although the Halo Trust alone destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades of bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 minefields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry then wanted to walk directly into the city of Huambo on the tracks of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same explorer who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to set out the way she went at that time. The pictures on which Princess Diana went through a clean minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She also had demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day African trip since Monday, starting in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
Brexit negotiations: The risk of no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly stated that he would not have a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations, but what statements have been made in the polarizing British for ever, and the recent judgment of the Supreme Court in the UK, like a Damoclesssword above the Blondschopf, has been cancelled at the beginning of this week, and a law adopted by the Parliament, Johnson, in the event of failed negotiations with the EU, has, however, always been excluded from the bilateral talks.
Boris Johnson thinks deal is still possible
But the pressure does not seem to go well past Johnson either. In the meantime, when visiting a hospital, he said that in the event of non-cleaning, he would support an extension of the negotiations by the end of October:
You know, we'll stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
And best with a deal. I'm very optimistic that it works.
And time is running out of the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. For about six weeks now, the EU and the British negotiators have time to prevent the withdrawal of Britain from the European Union without agreement, but the recent talks have not yet reached a breakthrough. An agreement until the end of October is now more difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not bring the law into force, a new shift in the date of departure is in force. The opposition does not trust the words of the Prime Minister. It is afraid that Johnson could somehow enforce the Brexit in the event of a no-deal.
US Authority: Other deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the US has increased to 12. In addition, there have been 805 confirmed and likely injuries in this context, the US Health Authority informed CDC. According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, there have already been more than 900 people involved, around 500 of them confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. In Europe, no similar increase in lung damage is known so far, and the complaints seem to be limited to users in the US.
The fear of new protests in Egypt is growing
Millions of times the videos of Mohammed Ali have been shared in online networks. The Spanish-based contractor and actor calls for a "People's Revolution." For this Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, who are accusing critics of corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes for mass news with one million participants in central places of the country.
The security authorities are in any case alert. In the centre of Cairo there was already an increased police presence. Several subway stations were closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were closed. In the past few days the police had strengthened their road controls and the mobile phones of pedestrians were partially searched for news and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, the protesters also gathered around the Tahrir Square.
Last weekend in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura there had been a protest with hundreds of participants. There had not been such an open protest in Egypt for years. According to the Human Rights Watch (HRW), the security forces responded hard. For the past week, almost 2000 people were arrested. Many of them had been arrested arbitrarily - just because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time," HRW reported to the prisoners on the basis of lawyers.
The organization also criticised the censorship in the North African country. Consequently, the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The general has been ruling the country since 2013 after he had overthrown the democratically elected Islamist President Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, opponents, bloggers and activists have been imprisoned and partially condemned in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs of Greenland Expedition Back
The Polar researcher Arved Fuchs returned on Friday from his Greenland expedition. He was welcomed on his arrival at the Hamburg port, among other things by the skipper Boris Herrmann, the climate activist Greta Thunberg with the race yacht "Malizia" over the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had examined and documented the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in the last few months.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the Polar researcher. He has been waiting for years for the young generation to come forward. For decades it has been known that the earth is warming. Nevertheless, many acted as if there were a planet B.
"What is happening on the sea often takes place under the exclusion of the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the munitions of the seas. In the expedition, among other things, was measured with a drone of Greenland glacier ice and fishing with networks for microplastic, it was said.
For his "fight for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's seas," the Polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" in the framework of the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who are at the heart of the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great example," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. "He is a witness to the changes that have occurred in the Arctic in recent decades."
Ture Spaghetti in Rome: Tourist paid for noodles 430 Euro
430 Euro for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Engelsburg in Rome: That seemed to be too much for two Japanese tourists. The bill with 80 Euro tip was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which caused hot reactions.
"Such cases harm the reputation of Rome. We call on the police to examine whether this is a fraud," a spokesman of Federagit, the Federation of Travelers in Rome, said the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The Japanese had ordered not only spaghetti but also fresh fish, the local owner justified himself. However, this is not to be found in the bill. A tip of up to 20 percent of the bill was also normal, the host said.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump could actually be faced with a withdrawal procedure after the turbulent revelations of the past few days, the Democrats want to examine this with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the speech is from weeks until a decision is made.
At the beginning of the scandal, the call to the public is supposed to be made with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj. The accusation of the Whistleblower, who has made the talk for concern about national security and the democracy of the US with his complaint, is monstrous: the President has abused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for an influence on the election 2020. He has used Ukraine's dependence in this to express and thus force it to act against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to be found in the now published co-writing of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not reflect the full text. However, the 25 July call is only an episode of a much larger story, in which the centre of which is in addition to Trump is his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story starts from the public's point of view in May 2019 when the New York Times reported to Ukraine by Rudy Giuliani's travel plans. He wants to meet with the newly elected President Selensky in Kiev, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. "We are not involved in a choice, we are involved in an investigation that we have the right to do," he says the newspaper. You may think it is inappropriate, but "nothing illegal." Giuliani himself knows that in Ukraine his intentions are being persecuted, because there is hardly any basis for my government to be "very helpful," because it could be a very helpful for my government to be for this.
The lawyer and former New York Mayor seems to have been infected with right conspiracy fantasies, which are fixed on Trump's counter-candidate in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine, said critics at the time to construct an occasion for the Russian investigation in the USA. However, this accusation was never to be taken seriously.
This is exactly the investigation that Trump will be talking about on the phone with Selensky in July. The version of Giulianis and the President is: The former Vice-President and currently promising candidate for the presidential candidacy of the Democrats, Joe Biden, has called for the release of the then Ukrainian general state attorney Viktor Schokin, who was responsible for the investigation of the gas company in which his son Hunder Biden was working, as a Ukraine representative of the Obama government, to be able to expel the people of his family.
In fact, the process was a little different. When Joe Biden asked the Ukrainian Attorney General to go, the investigation against the gas company was already closed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. In addition, Schockin was also accused of being deeply corrupt, the US government was not by far the only Western partner who was pressing for his release. Moreover, the Obama government also explicitly supported the investigation against the company.
Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp disorders: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive interference with Instagram and Facebook. Therefore, Germany, Great Britain and Spain are particularly affected. On the website allverkren.de users report that Facebook has not been charging again and again since about 3.30 pm. Instagram also issues the error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems to be affected by the disturbance, although not at the same level so far.
Instagram and Co. often affected by disturbances
It is not the first massive incident this year. Already in March and July, the services had failed for several hours. As in the previous cases, users are also taking advantage of Twitter to make their trouble clear.
Polish scientists saved in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists were rescued by the Chilean Air Force from the Antarctic ice. They were on the way with a tug boat and several miles away from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the bad luck - less than an hour the Chilean rescue helicopter needed for the recovery.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9: 30, we got the message, just before 10: 00, we started, and a good 20 minutes later we were over the hosiery."
Poland has been operating the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, and 19 scientists are working there.
Attention: Smartphone NIE charge without any charge
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently come on the market, which support wireless charging and sell very well - first of all the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. While the wireless loading of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature increases battery
Researchers warn of the wireless charging of smartphones. This is extremely harmful to the devices, according to the knowledge of the Universal of Warwick. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat development. If you normally charge a mobile phone by cable, the battery will be heated to 27 degrees within three hours. In the wireless charging, the researchers have measured even with the perfect alignment of the smartphone on the charging path, on the other hand, more than 30 degrees. If the mobile phone is located in addition to the coil, the temperature will increase even higher. In addition, the wattstrength of the charging path increases, which in turn drives the power consumption.
Capacity and life
According to the researchers, the temperature for the durability of batteries is a crucial factor. Each degree plays a role. When charging with higher temperatures, the battery not only reduces its capacity, but also does not last for so long. So, the life is less. The researchers therefore recommend that the smartphone always be charged by cable. Since an exchange of batteries in modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, this is likely to be a helpful tip. Apple has recently even increased the cost of an exchange of batteries - for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely comfortable: simply put the device on a corresponding charging path - these are already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without any annoying cable salad and tiresome plug-in. As Qi (stands for inductive energy transmission) is a world-wide standard, in which, exceptionally, even Apple is involved, there are few restrictions. However, according to the researchers, the technology should only be applied in exceptional cases.
Everest-Stau photographer: 13 thousand in six months
A Nepalese climber has, according to his own information, conquered 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) had reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and thus established a record, his expedition operator reported.
The former soldier wants to climb every 14 thousand in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible." He has already made international headlines: A photo of the mountain climbers who are on Mount Everest in the spring comes from him.
The picture of the mass barrier triggered a debate on greater security measures on the 8848 m high mountain and the highest peak of the earth. In May 11 climbers had died on the climb within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the climb of the 14th of the eighties: Currently, Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. The reason for this is, among other things, bad weather. At the beginning of week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wanted to talk to China to allow it to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is also a pregnant elephant cow, a police speaker reported on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned."
The four cadavers were found in a protected area near the famous and visited by many tourists former rock fortress Sigiriya. According to the police spokesman, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers in whose land the animals had previously been unharmed. At the same time, about 50 people are killed by elephants every year, most of the time, when the animals move through villages built close to their habitat.
In Sri Lanka, it is estimated that only about 7,000 elephants still live. In theory, their killing is the death penalty.
Contented British oil tanker is leaving Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after its arrest by Iran. This was announced by the maritime office of Bandar Abbas, according to the news agency IRNA. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard had established the British-flag tanker under the charge of disrespecting the rules of the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf on 19 July.
Management of Thomas Cook in the Critique
The responsible Economic Committee of the House of Commons wants to investigate the failure of the travel giant Thomas Cook in a comprehensive way. It is intended to deal with the salary packages of the Board of Directors as well as with the question of why the British government did not want to contribute financially to the company's survival-fighting business. "Our interest is to monitor the company as well as to control it by external auditors," said the chairman of the committee Rachel Reeves in London. "We are obviously dealing with a bad example of management greed."
According to experts, genes are overestimated at the risk of intestinal cancer
The role of genes in the family increased intestinal cancer risk has apparently been overestimated so far. To this end, researchers from the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg come in a current study. Other risk factors such as family diet habits are therefore likely to be more difficult than previously assumed. This has consequences for calculations of individual intestinal cancer risk, the DKFZ scientists stress.
Elon Musk increases Tesla shares
This was written by Musk in an e-mail published on Thursday (local time) by the "Elektreg" industry blog to Tesla employees. Demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110 '000 orders, it was called in Musk's newsletter.
The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to the customers, and Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla's shares went out of business with an increase of more than six percent. The course has not been so strong for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered over 95 '000 cars and thus reached its best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360 '000 to 400' 000 cars. In the current and next quarter, six-digit numbers have to be produced for this. Especially the most favourable Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Does the British government want to circumvent Brexit's law?
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is concerned about whether he is looking for a way to circumvent the last law adopted by Parliament against an unregulated Brexit, and, on Friday before journalists, he only said that his government would comply with applicable law.
The law requires the government to apply for a postponement of the expiry date if no agreement has been reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "surrender law," which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
On Thursday, former British Prime Minister John Major had said that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick to move the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU's exit.
Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is to reach an agreement."
Iran seems to be raising uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has increased the pressure on European parties in the fight to save the historic nuclear agreement. "Unfortunately, the European States show inability or lack of willingness to take concrete action," said Rohani on Thursday at a press conference on the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York. In the event that they were not in line with their promises, he proposed "further steps" away from the agreements of the 2015 hard-to-negotiate agreement.
The background is the conflict about the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return contained the commitment to normalise economic relations to Tehran. In 2018, the US went out of the agreement alone to force Iran with "maximum pressure" to change the course in the Middle East policy considered to be aggressive. President Donald Trump's government wants to negotiate a new agreement with more severe conditions and is now reinstating on hard sanctions against Tehran.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic now uses the centrifuges installed in early September with uranium or at least prepared for use. According to IAEA data, Iran is also preparing to build more than 300 further centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans were not prepared to carry their share of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and the burden of pressing US sanctions, suspected Rohani, but there will still be further talks that hopefully will bring about a solution.
Rohani continues to deny Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, the joint position changed: Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed the US assessment on Monday that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Hathi rebels in Yemen, supported by Iran, had confessed to the attack, but this was considered a false commitment by the US. "We have nothing to do with it," Rohani confirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who raise such accusations must provide evidence," said Rohani. However, the European leaders had not been able to do so in the talks with him during the UN general debate. Instead, they would only have called for the rebels in Yemen to not carry out an attack like this. Rohani had met with Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the past few days.
Prior to possible talks with US President Trump, the US administration's far-reaching sanctions had to be lifted, Rohani asked the government in Washington to turn to a policy of "dialogue and reason."
Comet of other star crosses solar system
Astronomers are currently watching a comet from the depths of space. This was first achieved. The comet allows for conclusions on other solar systems.
What was just a guess at the beginning is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depth of space was baptized after his explorer on 2I / Borisov and has aroused the interest of astronomers all over the world.
The far-travelled comet was discovered on August 30 by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissov at the Margo Observatory on Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter. Following several observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it was not from our solar system.
2I / Borisov after 1I / 'Oumuamua of 2017 is only the second interstellar object that was seen on a flight through our solar system.
2I / Borisov offers astronomers the rare opportunity to get insights into a foreign solar system from the vicinity before it disappears on never seeing again. First observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to that of our own system, as the astrophysical Institute of the Canaries reported. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is at this distance well above the typical speeds of objects that surround the sun," reported about Davide Farnochia of the US Space Authority in a communication.
According to the analysis, the comet is on the way to a so-called hyperbel track that leads it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as reported by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It is also responsible for the designation and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its explorer, the interstellar Swiss star, which was first led under the catalogue number C / 2019 Q4, was named 2I / Borisov, with the first part of the name pointing out that it is the second interstellar object that has been discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: In contrast to 1I / 'Oumuamua, 2I / Borisov has already been seen on the way. Thus, researchers will stay for many months for research. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and will then be seen with medium-sized telescopes by April 2020," explained Farnocchia. "After that, it will only be observed by October 2020 with larger, professional telescopes."
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. For example, a team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterisation of 1I / 'Oumuamua, in a first study determined the diameter of the celestial object to 2 to 16 kilometers. Images of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers from the astrophysical Institute of the Canaries (IAC) have already won a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar tail that offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to those of comets of our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar," said IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in our, added colleague de León Javier Licandro.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years, according to the IAU, suggests that these objects could open a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate how often such puncture visions are. One of the next interstellar visitors may be able to catch a planned satellite mission from the European Space Agency, Esa.
The agency wants to set up the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" (German, for example, comet-interceptor) at a waiting position in 1.5 million kilometres from the earth, according to Esa-Science-Director Günther Hasinger, or to an interstellar visitor like 1I / 'Oumuamua.
First landing on Peking's new Mega-Airport Daxing
On time before the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China, it is time: at the new Mega Airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger machine of China United Airlines has landed, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers will be completed each year at the new airport, and in 2025 it will already be 72 million. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion-year project. China's latest prestigious project is also called "sailors" because of its six-arm building structure.
The complex has four runway to be extended to seven later and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway will transport passengers to the city centre of Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction process, the Chinese had repeatedly stated that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006 - and much smaller - has been postponed again and again. In Beijing, on the other hand, a first passenger machine landed after four years.
New oversound aircraft is scheduled to fly in 2030: in four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - the British space agency UK Space Agency is dreaming of this. It is intended to make this flight, which was launched for the 2030's, a special drive at the overspeed of the event (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which is developed by the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, quoted the agency. "This is the technology that could definitely achieve this," said agency chief Graham Turnock to the station. "We are talking about the 2030 years of operation, and he has already advanced for the work."
In order to advance the project, the British Space Agency intends to work more closely with the Australian. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis is currently taking about 20 hours. As the only oversound aircraft for passenger transport to date, the Concorde had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 to 2003, and it took three to three and a half hours to do so. In 2000, there was an accident at the start of a Concorde at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, where all 109 passengers were killed. Last year, the American aircraft manufacturer of the New York-Paris-Paris route, the United States, announced a plan to develop the "Gaul," in conjunction with the United States, "the plan to develop a plan for the United States.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," writes Reaction Engines, among other things, on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound. Moreover, such aircraft are also usable outside the Earth's atmosphere and thus enabled the "next generation of truly reusable rams."
Arrest in Washington: Trump wants to track anonymous tipping in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair about the possible abuse of power by the US President, Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the information to the Whistleblower," said Trump on Thursday before the United Nations emissary at the United Nations in New York. The person concerned was almost "a spy" and in the past "a little different" than today.
This was considered a intimidation attempt against tippenders. The event was actually not public. However, several US media spread audio recordings of the speech on Friday. Democrats responded to the President's statement.
The Democrats in the US House of Representatives announced on Tuesday the preparations for an arrest procedure against Trump. Their allegations were based mainly on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence officer who raised serious charges against Trump and its government headquarters. At great public pressure, the signs of the notifier were made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the Whistleblower wants to have received information from several government staff, according to which the US President "uses the power of his office" to ensure that another country is in favour of the US election in 2020.
At the centre of the allegations is a controversial telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his colleagues to investigate, which could harm his political rival Joe Biden. This is about former business of Beiden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his protégé from Ukrainian justice. Biden is ahead of the race for the democratic presidential candidacy for the election 2020.
The Whistleblower also accused the White House with a view to the Ukraine phone call for cover-up: leading government staff would have tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under cover. As usual, an electronic text protocol had been made. However, this was removed from a database that was normally provided for by the White House, and instead was stored in a particularly protected system. So far, only a rough discussion protocol has been published.
The identity of the illustrator is not publicly known, and the New York Times reported that it was to be an employee of the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
Trump once again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the so-called "Whistleblower" had spread information from second hand, which had turned out to be incorrect. Therefore, there may be no tippers or spies at all.
The President of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, was concerned and complained that Trump's statement was once again undermining the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives, several investigations have been taking place for months in various committees against Trump and its environment. In view of Ukraine's allegations, the Democrats are now making new efforts to initiate a possible withdrawal procedure against Trump.
"The Whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation," said the Chief of the Secret Service Committee at the House of Representatives, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked ship sharply, threw him a false representation of things and once again called for the resignation of the chairman of the committee. Trump regularly shuts ship and had already asked for its withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former US government officials from the security and foreign policy areas, who were mostly active under democratic and also under Republican presidents, were behind the investigation of a possible withdrawal procedure initiated by the Democrats on Friday. If the allegations were true, that would be "a ruthless abuse of power" by Trump, it said.
There is no precise timetable for the further procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could attempt a so-called impediment procedure. However, the decision on an actual withdrawal of office was taken in the Senate where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far no US President has been relieved by an impediment procedure of the Office.
VW works council: jobs are reduced "creeping"
The VW brand's plans to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of production in Germany and Europe. This concerns the works council of the car manufacturer. The brand wants to reduce its annual production costs from ten billion euros to 2023 by two billion euros. Of which 500 million euros are to be saved this year.
The "future pact" negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. In principle, a job can only be reduced in the car manufacturer if it is virtually proven that the related activities are no longer necessary. Moreover, employment security is applicable until 2029.
However, as our newspaper now learned from works councils, jobs in production, which were not actually a disposition, are "slippery" over a different path - that is to say, past the official course. Thus, the free-going regular posts are often not reoccupied.
In these cases, the works council has no way of forcing the redeployment. Meanwhile, in many places, staff are missing, the compaction is increasing, the concerns of a gradual bleeding of the vehicle works would be greater. This also increases the fear that vehicle production could gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe because it is cheaper in other parts of the world. VW said only: "A change in the volume of employment is done as agreed socially acceptable along the demographic curve."
The VW brand wants to standardize production even more worldwide and to control new projects centrally. This is also to reduce costs and speed up decisions - the aim is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. At a management conference in Berlin, the production manager Andreas Tostmann said: "Especially in uncertain times from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the US and China, we are well advised to make ourselves critical."
There have already been successes in this way: for example, this year, for the first time since 2013, production costs per vehicle would be reduced compared to the previous year. Before journalists told Tostmann that the production time for the Gulf 8, which is to be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg, would be reduced by 1.1 hours. The exact production time figures for VW do not call it, according to our newspaper it is in the Gulf 7 round
20 hours.
In our region, the company Wolfsburg is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The works Braunschweig and Salzgitter produce components. For Wolfsburg, VW-internal is the rule that there must be built 800,000 cars every year to make the plant profitable. In 2018, however, only about 700,000 vehicles were used - due to the decline of diesel demand and the problems of switching to the new WLTP consumption and exhaust gas test.
As the production director Tostmann announced last year, however, in Wolfsburg a million cars are to roll off the band. This is to make the bundling of the golf production in the main plant possible - because the Zwickau plant, through the conversion to the location for the e-car production, is to make the golf production possible.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales of Gulf and Tiguan have recently been declining. Therefore, the expectations are now on the Gulf 8. He is to remain the wolf's bread and butter car for the first time, despite all the efforts to build e-mobility.
With Voodoo forced to prostitution: human traffickers condemned
Young women from Nigeria have been swindled, thrown into the Ruhr area and forced to prostitution. Six suspected human traffickers have to go to prison for this.
Six suspected human traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced to probation and detention sentences of up to eight years and three months on Friday in Bochum. The defendants had forced young women from Nigeria to the Ruhr area and to prostitution. In order to force their obedience, the sufficiently willing Nigerian women still had to take a ritual oath in the home before a voodoo priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought through the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan locks. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. In Germany, they were distributed to various brothels in order to deal with the alleged slurry costs of an average of 25 000 euros. The wage was therefore completely reduced to them.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the indentation and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women to brothel in the trial. "The work made the women physically and mentally difficult to create," said Judge Isabel Hoffmann at the verdict. "Some were really upset."
The judgments are based on professional and gang-related indentation of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, pimp and severe forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
Fim's permanent dispute with the Lufthansa Group has once again threatened the Ufo Air Services Union with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union will "inform on 14 October about the work-related measures in the LH Group," informed Ufo's collective board Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and its daughter Eurowings have been refusing to conduct collective bargaining with Ufo for months. It is also about whether the trade union has legally terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa.
On this point, Ufo now sees itself strengthened after a decision of the Court of Labour Frankfurt. Lufthansa wanted to see the collective agreements not terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examined the appeal against it. "I think that a second court sees the matter completely different," said Ufo's board of directors Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also submitted an application to the Frankfurt National Labour Court to have the Ufo reviewed as a trade union. The company argues that the trade union has not set up a representative board for months and is therefore unable to complete its role as a collective partner.
A strong leadership in the savings union, in which many members of the board of directors and the advisory board have resigned, was preceded, including the long-standing trade union leader Nicoley Baubles. The Ufo had suspended an already started-up vote on the strike of the cabin staff at Eurowings at the end of July because of the doubts about its leadership.
Facilitated entry: Saudi Arabia Announces New Visa System
So far Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet, but it is now to change, and the country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa provisions.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, the Commission announced that it would increase the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million a year.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is an historic moment for our country," said the President of the Commission on Tourism, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia is so far difficult to access to for tourists. Visas are usually only used for short business trips, religious pilgrimage or visitors with members of the desert state. With the new rules, the Ore-conservative Kingdom hopes to have more revenue from the tourism business. Riad, according to his own statement, wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In mid-September, several missiles and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in the east of Saudi Arabia: the country's largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oil field. As a result, national oil production was drastically reduced, the oil price shots were shot up. It is expected to take several weeks for the Kingdom's oil production to reach its old level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are in preparation for wedding
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for her wedding. The model posted in her Instagram Stories on Thursday (local time) several party photos on which she can be seen in the white wedding look. Reality-Star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organised a bachelor's party in Los Angeles according to the People magazine.
Justin posted several colorful, including bananas-printed suits on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me choose my tuxedo for the wedding." According to media reports, the celebrity couple wants to get married in church next weekend.
The bidders gave themselves the yes word in a New York State Office a year ago. There was no greater party at that time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently said that after the initial problems, the two found a common level: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship."
Two dead in the event of a plane crash in the Czech Republic
Two people were killed in the crash of a small aircraft in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreck was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Metschin), the police reported. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday night after the crew had given an emergency signal by GPS. In the search there was also a military helicopter in use. The cause of the accident still needs to be determined. The crash site is about 30 km south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 km north-east of Regensburg.
Half of European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, non-territorial species, non-sustainable logging and the growth of cities are the causes of the threat, the World Nature Protection Union reported in Brussels on Friday. It has examined the stocks of all 454 species of trees known in Europe. 265 of these are not found on any other continent. Of these 265, 58 percent were threatened. 66 were already at the highest level of danger and therefore before extinction.
The IUCN classifies endangered species in six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "endangered," "highly endangered," "threatened by extinction" and "extinct in nature" to "extinct." In total, it lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants worldwide as being endangered.
Eberesche and wild rock chestnut threatened
In Germany, in particular, the Ebereschen (Sorbus) was threatened, one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or by the transformation or weakening of their habitats."
It is also bad for the wild common rock-chestnuts. They have been considered as "endangered," stage two of the IUCN scale since 2017. The greatest threat is the Balkan-miner moths in addition to a mushroom. It has spread from South-East Europe over the whole continent since the 1980s and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild rock-chestnuts (Aesculus hippochestanum) in Europe to less than 10,000 specimens. Not taken into account in this assessment are the trees in cities, parks and alone.
Straucards and moose also in danger
The IUCN scientists at the same time created new European red lists for molluscs, shrubs and moose. More than a fifth of the molluscs and moose and almost half of all the ostracites were threatened, the IUCN says. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wild, to the introduction of species, agricultural practices and climate change. The molluscs such as snails played a key role in the recycling of nutrients in the soil and were an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overseen and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, Director of the European Office of the IUCN. "We need to limit the impact of human beings on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority."
Earthquake before Istanbul: 34 injured reported
In the recent earthquake in Turkey, 34 people were injured. According to the data, there were no deaths. Dozens of people should have left their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Octai on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were therefore damaged. Since the quake the day before there had been almost 200 aftershocks. The earthquake of strength 5.8 had shaken the Marmararegion in front of Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the millions of metropolis.
Now the government wanted to set up a Commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, announced Octay. In the last 20 years Turkey had not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable to the earthquake. Under the Marmaram there is a section of the so-called North-American disorder that marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian earth plate.
One of the most severe quakes was one of the 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time, the epicenter was located in Gölcük south-east Istanbul. More than 17 000 people were killed.
On Tuesday a quake of strength 4.6 had shaken the region around Istanbul. The authorities called on the inhabitants to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the half-time show
The Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the half-time show of the next American football final Super Bowl. The singers announced this at Twitter. "It won't be bigger," Shakira wrote about a photo of himself and Lopez. She is so excited to be on the Super Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020, it will be time in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez said that since 1996 she has dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl - at that time she saw Diana Ross fly to heaven at the half-time show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I will perform with another Latina." She could hardly wait to show us what we girls can do on the biggest stage in the world. "
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she was honored to be on one of the largest stage in the world and to represent Latin and Latin from the USA and the whole world. "And then also on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two "queens" were on a stage together.
Shakira is from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents come from Puerto Rico.
Fight against falling numbers of viewers
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most widely seen TV broadcasts in the United States. Even if you have last dropped the audience numbers: In this February the spectacle in the US attracted the least viewers for more than ten years. Nevertheless, it was still almost a hundred million people on average.
For the half-time show of the past Super Bowl there had been a stir in advance: in the fight about the handling of Quarterback Colin Kaepernick, media reports said that the top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to occur last February. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the half-time show - the critics were little friendly.
Kaepernick, then the quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, was on his knees in the season 2016 / 17 before NFL games at the National Anthem for protest against police force and racism. Kaepernick himself has been uniting since March 2017 and has no longer denied a NFL game. He did not want to challenge him for political reasons.
Cook-Plite: Hotels get money from insurance
Some banks are expected to get expensive the failure of the travel provider Thomas Cook according to a press report. There is a risk of high depreciation of outstanding bonds and loans. This also affects the credit Suisse, writes the "Financial Times" in its issue of Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or the Credit Suisse would probably have to write down the total amount of up to £1.8 billion (around EUR 2 billion) on their books, according to the report.
The creditors of bonds would have to purchase depreciation from 900 million to 1 billion pounds and the lenders from 550 to 825 million pounds. The amounts actually to be amortised should be at the top of the band's range, one expert told the paper.
The extent to which the losses of the creditors will actually be at the end of the insolvency proceedings will be shown. A person close to this procedure did not spur too much hope. For example, the about 40 aircraft of Thomas Cook in the UK were "old" and many of the real estate were in bad situations. The most money could be taken out with the sale of the airport slots and the brand Thomas Cook, it was said.
Rackete must have brought suspected murderers to Italy
The Sea Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who are supposed to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot rule out this, but we have no secure information on it ourselves," said the spokesman of the refugee organisation Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants would have recognized the three men in Italy, who were accused of raping, torturing and killing people in Libya, who were suspected to have been arrested in the host country in the Italian Messina. Newgebauer stressed that the refugee organisations could not verify who they left on their ships. "They come without passports."
On June 29, Carola Rackete had brought illegal migrants to the port of Lampedusa, and a ship from the Italian financial police, and the three suspects were to have arrived there on that day.
USA warn federal government in front of Huawei
The head of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the Federal Government of trusting Huawei's Chinese network equipment.
We believe that the risks are too great, "said Pai the" Handelsblatt "with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law," which each company "committed under Chinese case law" to follow instructions from the security bodies.
The current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests, "says the FCC Chief, which makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand a "declaration of confidence" from suppliers.
Berlin wanted to first try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, the "Handelsblatt" reports on its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology not only consists of hardware:
The software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time, "said Pai.
It is "very difficult to imagine" that a government authority, "no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks," said the FCC boss.
The Chinese company Huawei is presenting close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The company is not necessarily independent of the government, "said Pai, the" Handelsblatt. "
The United States was informed that government employees were placed within the company. Pai was recently in Berlin for talks to promote the position of the United States.
Chemieffabrik in North France is burning: schools closed
At night, residents hear explosions. A giant fire wall illuminates the sky over a North French chemical factory. The fire is extinguished after hours - but the cleaning up work could now take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and children's crèches remain closed in the region.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not open on Friday, the relevant prefecture informed. The Ministry of the Interior had asked citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not to put themselves on the smoke. There were no injuries. Farmers and breeders were called to bring their animals inside, to protect their food and to stop the harvest for the time being.
The fire could be completely extinguished on Thursday night, as the prefecture reported. There is still the risk that after the deletion there will be a spread of smell, so the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters and 90 police officers and gendarmes were in use at the fire site.
A giant black smoke column had previously been raised from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions at the Lubrizol factory, which produces an additive for oils. The production plant is located a few kilometres from the city centre.
According to the authorities, the plant in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous sites, which are particularly monitored. In the Italian Seveso near Milan, a devastating chemical accident occurred in 1976.
The Prefect of the region of Normandy, Pierre-André Durand, told the news station BFMTV that no "high toxicity" had been found in samples at first. However, pollution of the nearby Seine could not be excluded. In the river dust were built against pollution, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out early in the morning around 2: 40 p.m., the authorities reported. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis and is located on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Minister for Finance: "Germany must invest now"
The French Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs, Bruno Le Maire, has called on Germany to invest more in order to boost economic growth in the euro area.
Germany must invest now, the sooner the better, "said Le Maire on Thursday night at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The euro area economy was weak, the minister warned.
We must not wait for the economic situation to deteriorate to make the necessary decisions. "
It would have to be those countries that have budgetary scope for more investment, said Le Maire, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France did not have these areas of play, added the Minister and referred to the high government debt of his country, which is more than 98% of the gross domestic product. French government debt had to be "stabilized" and "reduced," said Le Maire.
In recent years, France has repeatedly made calls to Germany to make more public investment to revive the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to control its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020 presented on Thursday provides for tax relief of more than EUR 9 billion for households.
The French government is therefore responding, among other things, to the protests of the Yellow West movement. The new debt is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, according to the expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson evokes question about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticises the "surrender law" adopted by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law requires the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos-brexit. However, critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole, but this is the way the Tory politician is addressing.
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is concerned about whether he wants to enforce an unregulated Brexit - despite the last law adopted by Parliament, which is to prevent it. Johnson said to journalists only that his government will comply with applicable law.
The law provides that the government must apply for a postponement of the expiry date should not have reached an agreement with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "surrender law," which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
The former British Prime Minister, John Major, had said on Thursday that Johnson could try to "use political harassment" to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural trick that would move the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU's exit. Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is the one with an agreement."
Meanwhile, Johnson's chief advisor Dominic Cummings said that he felt the political debate about the Brexit as a "walk in the park" and showed confidence that the EU's aim was to leave: "We will enjoy this, we will win, we will leave (note: Red: from the EU)," said Cummings in the British newspaper "Telegraph."
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the election campaign before the EU referendum in 2016, is now acting as the head strategist in the British government seat Downing Street. He is to be behind the uncompromising policy that led the Premier to a very unspoilt situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they were all in front of Linda McCartney's camera, which has become one of the very big rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the great glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (bags) is deeply immersed in the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 to the death of Linda in 1998, was clearly proud and touched when he presented the picture band "The Polaroid Diaries" at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in mid-September. Among the illustrious guests were Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretender's front wife, Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch of the event, McCartney wrote at Instagram: "# ThePolaroid Diaries is a fleeting look into the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration for the legacy of LindaMcCartney as a committed artist and the immediate magic of the Polaroid film."
At Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona, until she found photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids made it, some hundred of which are now published in "The Polaroid Diaries" for the first time.
They are portraits, still life, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 1970s to the late 1990s. "She wanted real moments," writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword. And of course, one is always at the heart: her husband Paul - as you may have never seen him before.
There he danced with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, on the phone in the bathrobe with a bag on his head or wearing a moonboat. Of course, the McCartney were an extraordinary family, but it was not always a normal life in the McCartney farm in South England or Scotland. According to the BBC, Mary McCartney said that she had slept as a baby in a bed that her father had baked out of old potato boxes. And it was not always cleaned up at the McCartney's.
Like hardly any other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. The recordings of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It's about the decision click: you have to see when a great photo happens before you. And then you have to cut it in the exact right moment, "said Paul McCartney." If you cut two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo. "And Linda would have had the gift of always catching the right moment." She just knew that she had it, "said Paul in the eshua essay.
The light, the composition, the picture and the colors, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only a entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but also a great aesthetic pleasure in addition to all the anecdotes, where landscapes also look like abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the newly created Beatles album "Abbey Road," which was released exactly 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Turkey wants to continue to import oil and gas from the neighbouring country, despite the US sanctions imposed against Iran. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not stop oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there, "said Erdogan in New York, where he had participated in the UN General Assembly.
However, Erdogan admitted that Turkey had problems with the import of Iranian oil, as some companies "had withdrawn because of the US threats."
Nevertheless, Turkey will "continue our relations with Iran in particular on this issue and on many other issues," said the Turkish President, who had repeatedly criticised US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The US has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" towards the Islamic Republic since its departure from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the US, Iran is secretly pursuing an nuclear programme and is not following the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iran's oil exports and a serious economic crisis in Iran. In recent months, tensions in the Gulf region have increased considerably.
US government wants to limit the reception of refugees
The US government wants to drastically limit the reception of refugees, the US Foreign Ministry said on Thursday that the annual ceiling of a resettlement programme should be reduced from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees at present, equivalent to an average of 40 percent.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the US would continue to be committed to the support of refugees, but the main task was to protect and serve US citizens. Currently, the US immigration system is overburdened.
The US government wants to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups in the future: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and have thus been in danger, as the Foreign Ministry has said, but from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be received.
The programme set up in 1980 will select refugees from UN camps all over the world and relocate them in the United States. The ceiling for 18,000 refugees for the budget year 2020 would be the lowest in the history of the programme. The current ceiling of 30,000 is already a low value. When the predecessor of US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the White House, the figure was just under 85,000.
Aid organisations were very sorry to see the announced reduction of the ceiling. "This is a very sad day for America," said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The US would continue to damage its leadership role in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the US - legal and illegal - and according to its own data, the US government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming budget year. These figures are separate from the resettlement programme.
Donald Trump - "Get close to a snitch"
US President Donald Trump has accused leaders in the Whistleblower affair of the espionage. Whoever has given him the information he has given him, "comes close to a snitch," said Trump, according to a record of a private event on Thursday in New York. This is consistent with several US media.
So Trump spoke to the staff of the United States mission. When he was asked about the person who informed the Whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he answered: "This is close to a snitch." Then Trump added: "Do you know what we did in old times when we were smart? Right. The spies and betrayal, we used to deal with it a little differently than we do now."
Observers considered the latter to be a possible reference to the death penalty. The Democrats were very critical of Trump's statements and accused him of intimidation of witnesses. In addition, an attempt was made to impede a congressional investigation into a possible withdrawal procedure against him, the presidents of the committees on foreign, secret services and supervision in the House of Representatives.
The Whistleblower, in a now published complaint, is accusing the President of having abused his office in order to request an intervention of another country in the US election 2020. In particular, it is about his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Wolodymyr Selenskyj in the summer. Trump encouraged him to initiate investigations against his possible democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump denies any misconduct.
It is still unclear who the Whistleblower itself and its informants are. However, as the New York Times reports, the Whistleblower is to be an analyst of the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
Knotted refugee boat: Baby and young children drown in Aegean
People are constantly trying to get across the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. They regularly know the often too small boats. At the end of a tubing boat, seven migrants have now died - including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants were killed in the fall of a tug boat. Among the victims were also a baby and four other children, the Greek Coast Guard reported. Four children, three women and five men could therefore be saved from the floods from the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims should also be a lock, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had left Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group Inousses in the north-east of the island of Chios. Inousses lies between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea, mostly in too small boats. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on this route.
The Who Cancel Concert
A US concert by the rock band The Who has found a long end because of an inconvenience of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the show on Wednesday night (local time) in Houston his voice failed to work. At the eighth song Daltrey told the audience: "I think I should leave it as long as it is still running."
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend asked for an apology and added that Daltrey was "not able to speak now." The audience promised Townsend to come to his expense at a reparation concert. However, an appointment is not yet set.
For Friday in Dallas and for Sunday in Denver, The Who cancelled. They are to be picked up at a later date. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old band-mate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Renting suddenly stopped: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork will rise from the small start-up to the driving force on the world's most expensive real estate markets. But now the company is in crisis. Landlords have to fear billions of income.
The crisis of the office rental company WeWork is threatening to disturb the balance in the world's largest real estate markets. The company had set off founder Adam Neumann as boss a few days ago, moved the planned stock market entrance and started selling subsidiaries and values such as the private jet for the managers to gain financial margin for the coming weeks and months. In addition, the British "Financial Times" reported that WeWork had stopped the conclusion of new rentals with immediate effect, which is, among other things, the largest rental of office space in New York and London suddenly from the market.
WeWork rents large office areas in the long term and rents them in the short term in part small units to members. This can be individual freelance, small start-ups or whole departments of large companies. So far, WeWork is burning money with this business at a breathtaking speed. Last year, the company started a loss of $1.6 billion, with a turnover of $1.8 billion. This year alone, the rental costs of the rental of new large areas are expected to have increased to $2.5 billion. To limit the loss, the new management is now to have stopped the emergency and the rental of new areas with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded lease contracts with up to 15 years of maturity, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion, which could be a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for the whole of the real estate markets.
According to calculations by the economist Dan Alpert from Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, has been on just under 300,000 square meters of office space in the past 24 months. WeWorks's new contracts alone made it possible for the demand for offices in New York to be higher than the new ones in the market at this time. Without WeWorks expansion, the office space in the US metropolis would have increased in this time, as Alpert wrote in the "Business Insider." It is similar to London, where several dozen offices are now operating in the best location in Wek.
Even in the British capital, the balance on the real estate market could be significantly improved without further expansion of the aggressive start-up. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in an office house bought last year by the Sparkassen fund provider Deca for just under 100 million euros in the center of the financial metropolis.
Many landlords have converted their real estate to meet the requirements of WeWork with high investment. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the real estate owners would probably have to write off some of the expected billions of income. Access to the reserves of WeWork - which are already scarce - do not have any liability for the parent company, despite the long-term rental contracts. As a rule, the rental of the individual locations of WeWork is carried out by additional subsidiaries, known as Special Purpose Vehicles, which are only limited to the parent company.
Russia again captured numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In the past few days, a total of 262 poachers who had been illegally fishing in the waters have been arrested, according to the Russian domestic intelligence service FSB informed Interfax to the Agency on Friday.
It was only ten days ago that 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously, the border guards were shot and three of them were injured. This time there were no injuries, it was said. The Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way to Russian territorial waters, where the coast guard of Russia, according to its own information, is patrols to protect their marine biological resources. In the new controls, 30,000 squid were discovered. In addition, the data were confiscated after three fishing boats and two motor boats and brought to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok. According to the Agency Ria Novosti, the coast guard found in 2018 more than 8,000 infringements in total.
The Russian fishing authority had not issued a fishing licence to the North Koreans even after the actions of local entrepreneurs. According to the US, thousands of North Korea fishermen have already been arrested there in 2019.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained of high ecological damage by North Korean fishermen. They were fishing with narrow-scale synthetic networks banned in Russia. They would also bring small living beings out of the sea. Moreover, the networks would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they needed 200 years to be replaced. Even the ships themselves do not comply with the hygienic and technical regulations.
In the last week's arrests, according to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured. According to the FSB, a also wounded North Korean died later of his injuries. On September 17, Russian border guards first fixed a North Korean boat and then a second after it opened fire.
The United States is imposing an entry ban on ex-President Castro
The US has imposed on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children a ban on entry. The US Foreign Ministry founded this in a communication on Thursday with Castro's participation in "gross human rights violations." As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean State, he is facing a system in which thousands of Cuban people are arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As chairman of the armed forces, the brother of the dead revolutionary leader Fidel Castro was also involved in human rights violations there by supporting the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The contempt of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime is responsible for the current crises in Cuba and Venezuela," said American Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had made a ban on entry, among other things, against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, a bitter power struggle between the government and the opposition has been raging for months. The US has imposed a whole series of sanctions against Maduro's government to force him to the knees and to help the opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered one of the closest allies of Maduros. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of posted doctors. According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent many secret service agents to Venezuela to help the government in the repression of opponents.
New climate protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands of people want to go to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is planning to take part again in actions and demonstrations in dozens of countries worldwide. The beginning is expected to take place because of the time shift in New Zealand and Australia, before the protests move over Europe to North America. There, the climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to take part in a major rally in the Canadian Montreal.
How great the global commitment this Friday will be after the record participation of the last week is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday more than four million people fought for the climate. This Friday we do it again!," she wrote on Twitter. So far there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries in the context of the strike week, she added.
A good third of the world's demonstrators - around 1.4 million - had been involved in the protests in 575 German cities, according to Fridays for Future in 575 German cities. This time, according to a list of the movement, the people want to go to the streets in at least 65 cities, including in cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had set up the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 to call on its country's politicians to make a stronger commitment to climate protection. This has led to the Fridays-for-Future movement within a short period of time. The climate protests mainly involve students and students, but to an increasing extent also scientists and other adults.
Together they demand more ambition from politics in the fight against global warming and the threat of climate change. In particular, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming should be reduced to below 1.5 degrees compared to the pre-industrial period.
Thunberg had arrived in New York about a month ago after a two-week Transatlantic Törn with a high-sea racing yacht, where she had last participated in United Nations climate protests and summits. On Monday she gave an emotional speech to the UN, in which she spoke in an urgent way to the leaders of the world. In her home Stockholm she had been promised on Wednesday for her commitment to more climate protection of the alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Liveliood Foundation.
Russia forbids smoking on the balcony
The people of Russia are not allowed to smoke on the balcony in the future. This is a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," said a spokesperson of the Ministry of Emergency in Moscow on Thursday, the Tass Agency. The ban is to enter into force on 1 October.
If you still smoke, you have to expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette is to fire a fire, then the penalty is higher. According to the Ministry, the same burning candles are to be found. Also to grill meat on the balcony is no longer allowed.
Blow against cyber criminals - investigators lift servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time released a large server provider for illegal business in the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of hosting numerous websites through which international criminals operate their activities in a former Nato-Bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Mosel.
This was reported by the General Prosecutor in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday night in a major action. The Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
The suspect's clients are supposed to have been the operators of the world's second largest drug market in the world, "Wall Street Market," which had been destroyed in the spring. The attack on 1.25 million Telekom-Router was also controlled by a server in the Cyberbunker, according to the General Prosecutor's Office at the end of November 2016.
It was said that such a host had been removed for the first time in Germany. A web host provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
In the access action with the support of special units such as the GSG9, there were searches in Germany and in neighbouring countries. It was the result of almost five years of investigation. At noon the investigators want to inform about more details.
New global climate protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands of people want to go to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement once again planned actions and demonstrations in dozens of countries worldwide.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropolis such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a major exploration in the Canadian Montreal.
Climate protests, who are Thunberg's hintermen?
Justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. So much more amazing that a 16-year-old girl is holding the mirror before the people of power of this time. But what is behind it? Is it a willingness to help or a smart marketing of a climate activist? Historical master performance or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and brings young people to rise up for a better climate-friendly world. It is not the first time in Europe that a young person has been able to win a collection of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne has felt chosen to work for a more just world. At that time, he also has a lot of young people to gain for himself, and he has persuaded them to cross the sea to get to the promised land, as he has recently made a trip to a sailboat to America.
But is there a shadow side to this? Why is there a share called "We don't have time" needed to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers on her side. By the way, her mother has published a book, which has been widely sold, thanks to the daughter in the spotlight. Also well-known followers of Greta Thunberg were a little bit upset about the last PR show, or the journey with the boat was probably also too thick. This is also not well-founded, because the action has been very good for the media, and it has been a lot of money.
Here the spirits are now separate: is it morally right to enrich themselves financially in the saving of the world? Is it still authentic if certain groups of people work with stock exchange brokers during the world's campaign? No matter what position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflected point of view is increasingly important in a democratically-shaped society, because democracy lives from different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense to question seemingly pious projects from certain trendsetters critically.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A strange comet is crossing our solar system right now.
The astronomers' assumptions have confirmed themselves: a foreign comet is currently crossing our solar system - he is only the second of his kind.
Garching / Washington - For a long time, the researchers only suspected it, but now they have certainty: a comet from another star crosses our solar system at the moment. He was baptized after his explorer 2I / Borisov and is currently employing astronomers worldwide.
2I / Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers on Crimea
The body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissov on the Crimea. He looked at the sky with a self-built telescope and further observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind that was seen on the way through.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to get insights into a foreign solar system from the vicinity. Apparently, the comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the astrophysical Institute of the Canaries. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbel track that leads it out of our system.
Comet has been seen before arrival - and can be observed for several months
But before it is so far, the astronomers can see him in depth. Unlike his predecessor, 2I / Borisov has already been seen in his approach, which means that he can be studied from Earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia by the US Space Authority Nasa. "After that, it will only be observed by October 2020 with larger, professional telescopes."
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I / 2017 U1 "Oumuamua."
First findings about Comet 2I / Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be between 2 and 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because as the IAC researcher Julia de León says, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in our, in our, de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes beyond individual insights. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
The researchers have been busy with asteroids over and over again. Only recently, a giant asteroid was raging past the earth and came near it dangerously.
"Absolutely reprehensible": Rachel Johnson is horrified by brother
It is about Boris Johnson that it is more lonely. First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister, with clear words, heals the warlike language of the Prime Minister as "tasteless." It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitation," "fraud," Treaty ": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is constantly under pressure - at least verbal. At the Question Time in the House of Commons this Wednesday, this was a result of massive indignation from the opposition, and more critics have now spoken: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother used words like surrender, as if the opponents of an EU exit were to be "hanged, pulled, quadrupled, tipped and fenced." She considered this to be extremely reprehensible. She did not recognize the version of her brother, said Rachel Johnsons, who had been in the EU Parliament elections for the anti-Brexit party "Change UK."
She was particularly impressed by the fact that her brother Jo Cox mentioned the Brexit, an EU-friendly resident who had been murdered by a Neonazi a few days before the 2016 referendum. Her memory was best appreciated by the fact that Boris Johnson had been said in the House of Commons. "It is very flawless to refer to a Member who was murdered by someone who called 'Britain first', now criticised Johnson's sister. The perpetrator obviously came from the right-wing camp, which was" very sad for all that, it felt "
The widow of Cox also strongly criticised the Prime Minister. "It makes me sick when Jos name is used that way," he tweeted. The best way to honor it was to be passionate and determined for what you believe in - no matter what you think you are. But never to "demonize the other side." He also claimed that an atmosphere had been created in which attacks were more likely.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo had set up his post as State Secretary and his mandate as Tory Member. "I have been torn between loyalty to the family and the national interest in the past few months - it is an indissoluble tension," Jo Johnson founded the step.
Johnson's language also met with sharp criticism in the Church. As the "Times" reported, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticise the language that is "not worthy of this country." In a joint statement they said: "In the past few days, the language, both in debates and outside of Parliament, has not been acceptable. We should speak with respect."
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
The NFL sets a strong sign in the year of its 100-year-old existence: in the half-time show of the coming Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots are coming up. They promise "an explosion of fun and energy."
Latina power at the Super Bowl: The Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the half-time show at the upcoming final of the US football league NFL. The organizers announced this on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community in addition to JLo, because this has an incredible strength in the USA," Shakira reported in a video.
The final of the American football league, which will be celebrating its 100th birthday next year, will be held in Miami on February 2. In the metropolis at the southern tip of Floridas, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is a Puerto Rican origin.
"I love that this time the Super Bowl puts two women on stage - and two Latinas," said Lopez. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy."
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents had emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed with songs such as "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later published songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and is seen in the drama "Hustlers" in German cinemas from November.
Shakira was known in Colombia as a star of a telenovela and singer. She made her world breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Wheever."
The announcement of the half-time guests is expected to be a matter of tension in the US every time. This year many also consider the selection as a political gesture. Finally, the country, not least through President Donald Trump's immigration policy, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the largest US sports event and at the same time a huge advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones have been there for Furore. As a rule, the NFL final has seen over 100 million television viewers, it is now also very popular in Germany.
Last year there was political controversy in advance. The reason for the quarterback quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to stand up to black people for protest against police force, was the fact that the Maroon 5 rock group was in the process of being played, and that many of them had been criticized by President Donald Trump. In solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had rejected a super-Bowl appearance - including Rihanna and Pink.
An actor and a Youtuber is adding to Egypt's ruler: for the time being, Mohamed Ali would rather stay abroad.
The two men who have an influence on whether or not the streets of Egypt are back in blood have spent the past week both abroad. One of them moved back to Cairo on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-general, who in 2013 sent the Muslim brother Mohammed Mursi, the first freely elected head of state of the country, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisi's action against political Islam and did not lose Silbe on the human rights abuses in the city of Egypt, "he said, not to the people who were in charge of the war in the city.
The President of the other man, who is currently determining what is happening on the streets, is trying to mislead him. Mohamed Ali, of course, remained abroad, where he would take away the access of the security forces who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. A few weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor only a minority of the Egyptians. Today, he is the voice of the people who are in charge of the political discourse in the cafes, the living rooms and the teaspoons of the country: with his Youtube channel "Mohamed's secrets," Ali calls on his countrymen to rise up against his countrymen.
He goes to the head of state directly and in a very rustic language. While the people were hungry, the president was in luxury and being able to build magnificent new palaces, it is said. The army leadership, on which Sisi is based, is accusing Ali of corruption and enrichment. Because he has been doing business with these gentlemen for 15 years in his second profession, he seems to know quite clearly what he is talking about - at least that is the impression of many Egyptians, as the very exploding clicknumbers show.
After the first time in the past week since Sisi's handle had demonstrated thousands of people against his rule and almost 2000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested for the first time since the time after the power, Ali called for a "million march" for this Friday. The fact that so many people would dare to go to the streets was unlikely. But there were isolated smaller protests, for example in Giseh near Cairo and in the place of Kina at Luxor. Videos showed protests, whose participants Al-Sisi were in corruption, and the police were not trying to get rid of the police.
From the city of Mansura in the Nildelta, where demonstrators closed up last week with the president's portrait, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the outroads. In Cairo, several underground stations in the city center were closed because of "maintenance work," most of the streets around the Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 revolution, were blocked. And on the Rabaa Square, where 2013 followers of the crashed Muslim brother of the Moslem, were expected to be able to take a great deal of fire to the city's 800 people, and to be able to take a great deal of action here: a great deal of the war.
Mohamed Ali made these arrangements change his tactics: "Our goal does not have to be the Tahrir Square," said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera. "Let's not meet with police officers." But as a retreat, this is not to be understood: "All Egypt is the Tahrir Square."
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection seems to be much slower than the service provider, there are different testing possibilities.
Those who conclude an Internet contract do not need to trust the speed of the providers. Customers can check for their own details how much of it is actually achieved.
Finally, the pre-promised transfer rates are a component of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, the central consumer of Bavaria explains.
If the connection appears to be much slower than the service provider, there are different test possibilities. The measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them to the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the tests of the suppliers are carried out according to the provider-specific requirements and are therefore not calculated in a uniform and objective manner," the consumer centre of Bavaria, on its side, gives consideration.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set a reasonable time limit of 14 days for the provider to make the promised performance. This is best done by the person concerned in writing.
If this does not work after a number of requests, customers may terminate and may also demand compensation. However, if there is no success, only the action will help.
First high-ranking Republican for investigation
As the first high-ranking Republican, the Governor of Vermont has expressed his support for an impediment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are established," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wanted to know more about the Whistleblower affair before measures are taken - an impediment procedure can lead to the President's withdrawal.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate interventions by the democratic presidential candidate and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump has been watching "for years."
Republicans have so far been holding back with criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair; few have been displeased with it. Scott's statements are a first sign of this in Trump's party. Scott, a modern Republican, has already turned several times against Trump's policy, for example against the easing of environmental legislation and the tightening of immigration rules.
Spider-Man remains in MCU: More Marvel-Film planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August it was announced that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would not be part of the "Avenger" universe anymore. It was completely unclear how to continue with the movies around Tom Holland.
Now the surprise is that after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home," Spider-Man will receive another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). This is consistent with several US media. Therefore, the film is to be started in the USA as of July 16, 2021.
In the "Screenrant" magazine, Marvel-Bos Kevin Feige is quoted: "I'm glad to see that Spidey's way is continued in the MCU. I and everyone at the Marvel Studios are very pleased that we can continue to work on it... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in various universes, as Sony is still working on his Spidey verse. You never know what the future will bring."
But how does the sudden good news come about? Sony Marvel is supposed to have made an offer. According to industry magazines, the Disney group, which also belongs to Marvel, would participate with 30 percent in the revenue of coming Spider-Man films. However, the message is not confirmed.
This is how Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry show up in the "Suits" final
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" has now arrived in the United States at the big final. In the last episode there were many happy ends and as many cameo performances. And also the generous couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who worked for many years in the series, was crowned in a charming way. Attention, the following sections contain spoilers for the series final.
One way forward: in the final, Duchess Meghan did not return for a last farewell as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some of the most memorable scenes with today's Duchess were shown again. For example, the moments of the failed and the successful wedding with Mike or how she welcomed him after his severed sentence.
But her real husband, Prince Harry, was also mentioned in the "Suits" final, of course, in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) is just heading towards the altar to marry his fiancé Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a very promising comment about his approach. Whether he has actually overtaken a touch, the dusty Harvey wants to know about the groom, only then to be snippet: "Louis, you are not the Prince of England."
Aegean: Baby and four other children drown in boat accident
When a refugee boat was found in the Aegean, a baby and four other children drowned. In total, seven people died in the accident, as the Greek Coast Guard reported on Friday. Nationalities were still unclear.
The boat fell near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 174 people were killed. Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer has now announced that he would like to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the responsible EU Commissioner, he wanted to be informed in Turkey about "what the situation is about the refugee situation," said Seehofer on Friday. He then wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens to help deal with the situation.
A speaker from the EU Commission confirmed on Friday the planned trip of seavictims with EU Commissioner for the Interior, Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Minister for the Interior Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, there are still unusually many migrants from Turkey. On Tuesday alone, 654 people transferred to the Greek islands, it was said by the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey deal still working?
The increase in the number of people who have recently expressed doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey Agreement, which was concluded in 2016, provided that the EU could send back all refugees and migrants illegally to the Greek islands via Turkey. In return, the EU wanted to take on a Syrian refugee from Turkey for each of the displaced Syrians.
However, the processing of asylum applications is only a matter of time on the Greek side because of the lack of staff. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, there are almost 29 400 people on Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos. The worst situation is the situation in Lesbos: 5200 migrants are currently in a camp with capacity for 650 people.
Never since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016 had it been so many, the state radio reported.
Climate change: heat leads to more heart attacks
According to doctors, climate change will be testing the health system in the future. Climate change is "certainly" one of the greatest challenges for the health system over the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society for Cardiology. In particular, the cardiovascular system made high temperatures and large temperature origins within a short time and led to more heart attacks. Especially people with cardiovascular diseases, elderly people and diabetics are affected.
Green politician must be responsible for embarrassing photo opanne
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the campaign - was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green Chief holds a multi-way cup in his hand in a photo. But now it came out: the cup was manipulated.
Ottawa / Canada - It has remained unnoticed for quite a long time - and finally noticed. The reusable coffee cup with metal straw, Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens, was never in the hand. On the party's website she was seen in a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published and also spread to the media - and there the cup was still a snout (papp) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green Chief must be responsible for photopanne
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and that the Party is producing Fake News to appear more credible on the subject of "environmental protection," and this is in the middle of an election campaign for the lower house election, in which it is increasingly difficult for Trudeau to do because of a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral in the social media and started the discussion about Fake News. A user shares a comparison of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their presidents to hide their disposable cup."
May was shocked and argued on her blog that she had not known about this action. To underline this, she posted the original: She, in conversation with citizens, a cup in her hand. However, she was right, she was from Bamboo. She always brought him in. One of the party's speakers said that it was just about putting the party logo in the picture, and not to cover up something. From the photo, there is only one part to be seen on the website.
May writes that she is sorry for the employee who did this. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she said to the Guardian at the same time asking herself something from her overcommitted team: "If they want to work on a picture again, could they not do something with my face, so I look younger?"
The German Greens have also come to Shitstorms because of their use of one-way plastic, or because of flight travel - their pictures were not fotoshopped, however. So the boss of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate ice cream with plastic spoon, as merkur.de * reported.
Influencerin wants free upgrade: life-long flight ban at Cathay
It was said that Jaqueline Ng was an upgrade by mail from Cathay Pacific. But when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontaneously get an upgrade for the business class - many passengers dream of it. Sometimes they are lucky, and the employees at check-in offer a change from the economy class for free.
This case, however, shows how not to do it: A self-explained influencerin has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. Instagram follows Jaqueline Ng more than 65,000 users. On May 30 she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7.
On the flight, the employees refused to upgrade Jaqueline, although they had shown a mail in which their Cathay Pacific allegedly proposed an upgrade. The letter wanted the influencerin received from a marketing employee of the airline. The airline, on the other hand, accused Jaqueline of falsifying the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-distance flight. This time, the woman was supposed to have shown the same mail, but with another reference number. The staff at JFK airport were sceptical: they were hacking at the headquarters. And in fact, the employee from which the mail was supposed to be from should have stopped the mail contact with Jaqueline. This also confirmed the mail system in which the messages did not appear.
The airline staff at the airport canceled Jaqueline's ticket and imposed a life-long ban on Cathay Pacific. For 1,400 US dollars (about 1,280 euros) she had to buy a new ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencerin turned to Elliot Lawacy, a company that represents consumer interests, because Cathay had paid her the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also called back the costs for the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: for Cathay, the influencerin has committed fraud, it is closed for future flights. The airline's terms and conditions also state that it does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with this - and now turns on a lawyer.
Oil prices are based on the report on the ceasefire in Yemen
The oil prices fell by more than one dollar in the shortest time of Friday morning. Last, a barrel (159 litres) of the North Sea species Brent 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price of a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
It was a report by the Wall Street Journey on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia in mid-September had brought down five percent of the world's oil production. The Hathi rebels allied with Iran in the civil war country Yemen had recharged the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, is responsible for Iran. A ceasefire would disarm the political tension in the region.
If an agreement is actually reached, one could focus on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, head of the raw materials strategy department at the Saxo Bank of the news agency Bloomberg.
The oil prices continue to move down the last few days. A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost up to almost $59, Brent almost $65.
Last of all, Bloomberg had reported on insider that the repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia was moving faster than expected after the attack in mid-September. Consequently, the production volume had reached another eight million barrels a day and moved back towards the original amount.
Last but not least, there have been press reports calling on insiders to report on the rapid progress of the state oil company Saudi Aramco in the repair work. However, raw materials experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco was currently trying to avoid a stock exchange plan and negative headlines.
At the same time, there was a little relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the capture by Iran and the recently released release on the way to leave the port. The crew now prepared the departure, while the ship is still in front of the anchor, told the Swedish broadcasting company Erik Hånell in a text message on Friday morning.
However, the US announced that it would move defence missiles and soldiers to the Iranian archenemy in Saudi Arabia. The fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom had, in the past few weeks, made oil prices very much higher.
Injury against Trump is getting worse
In the case of possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, a number of leading government officials have made an intense effort to prevent the word-reading of the White House, following a controversial call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, which was an anonymous guide. The spokesperson of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, explicitly accused the White House of "covering up." Trump spoke of a "witch hunt."
North Korea considers third summit of Trump and Kim to be questionable
North Korea has expressed doubts that in the nuclear dispute there will soon be a third summit of leaders Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. The meaning and the prospects for success of such a meeting are questionable because of the lack of progress in the implementation of agreements at the first summit in Singapore, said top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday, according to the agency KCNA.
The US had so far not done anything to implement the decisions of the summit in the previous year, said the advisor of the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He also criticised increased US sanctions and the joint military maneuvers of the United States and South Korea. But he hopes for a "wise" and "courageous" decision to bring Trump back to an approach.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim was to bring before he was ready to do so. The negotiations on the disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile programme have been under way since the failure of the second summit of Trump and Kim in February in Hanoi. In June, both of them met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to revive the discussions, but to date without great success.
Prince Harry: Weapons manufacturers should help with mine clearance
With a blue splinter-guard vest, the British Prince Harry has symbolically lit and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola. He was close to a camp of the British Halo Trust at the place of Dirico. At a safe distance, the explosive body exploded. With a view to getting Angola to 2025 minefree, he later called on the running TV cameras: "I call on all the countries whose names are on these weapons, but who did not help to get out of the way."
Pound under pressure - interest reduction expected
British pound under pressure
In the light of an early reduction in interest rates, the pound is losing value over the euro.
Frankfurt speculation on an early fall in interest rates of the Bank of England (BoE) is adding to the pound sterling. On Friday the British currency was in favour of up to 0.4 percent to 1,2269 dollars.
The result of the sales were statements by the Notenbanker Michael Saunder. This led to a reduction in interest rates, even if a chaotic brexit could be turned off because the uncertainty would affect the British economy in the foreseeable future. This statement was surprising, as Saunders was considered to be a supporter of a restrictive monetary policy, said Analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the Brokerhaus Activ Trades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burden on the economy of the Brexit Hickhack without directly signalling a reduction in interest rates. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country out of the EU without a divorce agreement on 31 October.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk, but it could pay for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Other Russian manipulations proved
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is being manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, the former director of the World Anti-doping Agency (Wada) and today's head of integration of the World Light Athletics Association.
New details on the Doping scandal in Russia are coming to the start of the World Athletics World Cup - and they are destroying the little credibility that Russian sport had gained at the beginning of the year and only at the start of the year. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-doping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out that they were falsified.
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sport had been revealed. The Wada had closed the Russian anti-doping agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banished from the world stage. After an individual examination at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, the International Olympic Committee had held around 270 athletes of the country under a neutral flag, and in the winter games in February 2018, 168 Russian athletes were at the start. They were also allowed to take part in the World Cup in the various sports, which took place in the summer with the WM as a host in Russia.
Positive findings are missing
The following September, the Wada lifted the Rusada-Bann again, but requested access to the laboratory and the samples in question. The data should provide information on the extent of the cover-up of doping cases during the state doping. They should help to punish athletes afterwards. Three months later they were finally delivered.
However, the chairman of the independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Light Athletics Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the Doping data from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory has been manipulated. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the Task Force received the right data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" of Friday. "We have identified numerous discrepancies between the data that the Wada received from a Whistleblower, and those that they were received from the Russians in January."
The World Cup not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The only organization to hold the Lichtathletics Association is the Bann of Russia. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes under a neutral flag start. They had to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada manipulations had already put in place and Russia had asked to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening the renewed blockage of the Rusada and in the worst case also the exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
