Barack Obama receives the Nobel Peace Prize as fourth US President
American President Barack Obama is coming to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth US President in history.
He also receives the diploma and the medal and a check of over 1.4 million dollars for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House arrives tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the north-way metropolis and will be busy all the time.
He first visited the Nobel Institute, where he met the five Committee members who elected him from 172 people and 33 organisations in October.
The President's couple then planned a meeting with the Norwegian king Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit will reach its peak with the ceremony at which Obama takes over the prestigious prize.
He is given this as the fourth president of the United States, but only as the third to receive the prize directly in office.
The White House already avided that Obama will talk about the Afghan war in taking over the prize.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he knows that he is taking the prize as a president who is currently at war in two countries.
A few days ago, he strengthened the efforts of war by sending further troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony Obama also received the gold medal, the diploma and the check over ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate the money for charity, but he has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The event programme then provides for a banquet with the President and his wife, in which, in addition to Norway's king and queen, the Prime Minister and another 250 invited guests will be present.
Obama was very restrained from the beginning from the price.
He said, for example, that he has the feeling that he does not deserve the price.
He also repeated several times that the price is not only for him, but for all those who seek the same values as him.
As soon as the announcement was made, he stated that this was "a call for action."
Natural Protector is accused of extortion
The Leitmeritz police accused the chairman of the civil society "Leitmeritz Nature Protection Community" for blackmail.
In several cases, in the last year, he made appeals against some construction procedures, for the withdrawal of his appeals he called for money from the investors to his advantage, said the Leitmeritz police spokesperson, Alena Romova.
The Chairman of the Leitmeritz nature conservation community, Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in prison, and he's under a prison sentence of up to three years.
The Sortier-Dumpster in Brno does not smell good
In Prague people can sort the drinks packaging, in the South Moravian villages you can find the Sortier-Dumpster again on step and step.
And in Brno?
There you have to reserve a few minutes to find the appropriate garbage cans.
I do not want to say that the waste separation in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that the Council is not taking sufficient care of this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is located in the waste separation in the Urwaldliga, not only because we, as citizens, are always allowed to dispose of paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers, but above all because of the number of waste tons for such waste.
Have they ever tried to dispose of, for example, the PET bottles in a collection basket?
It's just art, it takes time and a lot of nerve.
The only place I've found so far, by chance, is the Moravian Square across from the strapped goose.
Mr Unterka should not annoy us his colleagues, but that is far too little to me.
Apart from the fact that waste separation is not a honey leak in other parts.
The whole series of my friends therefore prefer not to sort out the waste at all.
Out of laziness.
It is too far from them to the garbage cans.
I'm not surprised.
I offered to dispose of some glass and plastic bottles even after the party.
But on the Konicova road, I didn't see any colour waste tons in sight.
Fortunately, I came to the right place when I was on the tram.
The garbage was almost over.
This is still the center of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn't it?
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably leave the Brno Socialists cold.
They prefer to buy the city an ice hockey league that makes us feel ashamed throughout the Republic, rather than buy a few more garbage tons and offer the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my adoption with official statistics after looking for a while on the Internet.
According to the data of the EKO-KOM company, Brno is really the worst in the entire district of South Moravia.
The "Paroubek" budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sickness benefits
In spite of the government's view, the Left Party gave more money to farmers and officials, there is no more money in the budget for pensions, health care and construction savings.
But also not for the state-of-the-art or the international court-martial.
This will cause even more problems to those who will be in the government in the second half of next year, says the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists have enforced the increase in pay for some groups, they were expecting the government to pay additional attention to the sensitive expenditure, old-age pensions or health care. "This is just a postponement of the problems to the future, minelaying," says Janota.
More and more interest is paid from the loans, and one must eventually refund the money.
Too much to choose from, the state fund is empty.
If social benefits or costs are not reduced for the public sector, the tax should be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party now gave more money: the fire brigade, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for their children.
For the pensions or the health money, from whose account has disappeared 1.8 billion, people don't need to be afraid, they get that money.
But at the price that the state owes itself even more - in the next year, not only 163 billion will be missing in the state funds, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will increase more and more quickly and, together with this, costs and interest.
The state will need the money to compensate for it, then it will no longer be enough to increase VAT only slightly or to reduce the maternity money, as the government did in its counter-deficit package.
As a result of the money-laundering in favour of a number of electoral groups, five billion will be missing in the next year for the development of motorways and railways.
These are mainly the sections obtained in the competition, which can no longer be redesigned and possibly cheap.
To get the highest, which is also not free.
This means a delay or a cessation of thirty large buildings, also at risk of Europe's money-creation, the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka warns.
The CSSD has proposed that it solves the flow of money salomonically - it attacks the CEZ share dividends, where the state is the owner of the majority, and from them the money is then distributed into the transport fund.
The problem is that the level of the dividend is never safe and it is not an infinite source.
Last year, the budget was 18 billion from CEZ.
Every year, the dividends pay for environmental damage liquidation, fill in the pension account, and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
This trick also increases the actual budget deficit to the non-level of 5.7% of GDP under EU rules.
This does not end the carnival of the upheavals.
Almost three billion have been cut in the budget for various compensation for victims of communism and crime or for expenses for court disputes, even for building savings.
Whether the state can manage without this money is not safe.
It's just a game of luck.
If we lose an international trial, then we have to pay for it anyway, Janota makes it clear.
The Minister will then have to save the money internally or at worst attack the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing for the two-million-dollar project "Staatskasse," which has already been launched, which is intended to enable on-line monitoring of what the individual authorities are spending the money on.
The first stage starts in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions would come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
The Americans expect a mobile phone for the future, on which the user can switch by pressing a single key between different operating systems.
The plans presented are promising.
It is enough to press just one button, and from Windows Mobile will change Android within a few seconds.
This is exactly what the American company VMware wants to present, which focuses on the development of the virtual software for the computers.
We allow you to run two user profiles on your phone at the same time.
You can switch between them, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti explained by the company VMware during the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented last November and presented for the first time a few days ago.
The market will be in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is not a fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented the smartphone test model with two operating systems to the journalists.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM memory of 128 MB, on which at the same time the mentioned systems Windows Mobile and Android ran.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
The company VMware is now working with the European and American operators on smartphone virtualization and to the customer the devices will come within the year 2012.
Snow light on the mountains tortures the hotel owners
Sneelless slopes do not only make sorrows to the giant mountain residents.
The lack of snow also frightens people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Giant Mountains you can still get free rooms for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are often visited.
People go through the offers, determine the prices, but they are now afraid to order binding.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on matsch," the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, led.
If you want the New Year's stay in the spindle mill exactly according to your ideas, you should no longer hesitate to order.
If you prefer saving and where the quality of your stay comes in second place, you can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mostly only weekly stays for the New Year's Day.
I think that they will be trying to sell it for a while, but then they must also give up and deal with shorter times.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly, appreciated Jandura.
The travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi always offers free beds at all winter dates.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
In our offer about half of the places are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, the director of the travel agency Ingtour, Petr Scheifert, led.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can also offer the New Year's Eve in Giant Mountains, but there are less free places here.
The first fourteen days of February are also well received, and the rest of the winter dates are sold on average.
This year's interest in winter stays is also negatively affected by the fact that there is no snow in giant mountains.
People are waiting to see if snow falls.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowy within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schefert.
Conversely and slightly better than last year, the rooms at the Hotel Horizon in Pecpod Snezkou are managed to occupy.
We are about five percent better than last year.
On New Year's Day and Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holiday in January, and in February the business will also run well, the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada informed.
80 percent of the New Year's stay is also occupied by Hotel Omnia at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, half of the beds are still available at the latest hotel in Janske Lazne at Christmas.
We were very surprised this year of January, for which we are already about 60% occupied.
A little weaker is now February, but in the moment the snow comes, the interest in the remains in the Giant Mountains is also likely to increase, the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch, led.
The giant mountain hotel owners are now waiting for a larger snow show.
On Thursday it should cool off and if precipitation occurs, it should be snow on the mountains.
But after that there will be another warming, Jiri Jakubsky informed from the Czech weather office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Replay is Mother of Wisdom
It is almost strange, with which student-enthusiasm Barack Obama, the President with his reputation of the brightest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan question, which he himself thought was the stupidest.
When he finally watered out his long-awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he wrote it on the copy paper from the Busch-Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only did he use the term "as in Iraq" in the text several times, he even used the name of the January 2007 Bush Declaration as the name of his own declaration: "New way forward," without any hesitation.
He himself, three years ago, criticised the Bush idea - sending fresh troops to Iraq, which was plagued by the civil war - as "irresponsible and in their follow-up to the tragic decision."
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy, which was based on recommendations from the military, was the only possible one, and to the extent that it was very successful, that today the news about Iraq no longer speaks at all.
The reputation of Bushs was not improved by this, because objectively he left his successor a much more grateful starting situation than it was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat itself.
The military have again asked him to increase the troops' account, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghanistan operation General Stanley McCristal, who even despite the subordination habits was very critical of the beaming shooters in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to be able to reverse the situation for the better.
The President hesitated for three months, but did not come up with a better idea, and so he betrayed the general of the people by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has pressed for a further 5,000, even though he was originally expecting at least 10,000.
The whole Obama strategy is highly problematic in its intention to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to complete this process within three years, leaving more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the halved increase will bring the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Even in spite of the brotherhood of recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well structured and its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is marked by the contraindication - no one can rely on and no agreements are held.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces used to change their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally set up correctly, will only remain headway behind which patriarchal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the uncertainty of the conditions that further complicate the Pakistani and Iran influences.
The building of a "capable state," which is the minimalist objective of the whole operation, is also very unrealistic.
Time horizon of Obama's strategy alienated by its Voluntetarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the verge of the explosion.
In this sense, the little soldiers who have broken into the war cry about the "early return" are creating a miracle here can only create a truly romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible because the Taliban will accept this as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan is at a disadvantage.
Europe's politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters the way in which the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindukusch region.
Another possible factor that can radically affect the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect Iran, there is a very serious question for the United States whether the problem cannot be solved with troops.
This question must be answered in the period in which America is going to Obama for the victory of Afghanistan.
However, any solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that three years to the presidential election remain, and therefore there is still enough time to reach another strategy if it were to prove to be a total failure.
The managers of the Bank Goldman Sachs no longer receive premium bonuses in cash
The leaders of the American Bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive premium bonuses in cash this year.
This is what the company has announced, which is thus responding to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers will receive shares instead of the money, which you can only sell in five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn from managers in the event of excessive risk.
According to the Reuters Agency, Goldman Sachs is in the forefront of efforts to connect the premium bonuses of Wall Street with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, the former banker of the company JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott, led.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of the criticism after she put aside almost $17 billion for premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of premium bonuses during this year is likely to exceed $20 billion according to the Reuters Agency, despite the measure shown today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries at the beginning of the financial crisis.
On Wednesday, the UK reported that it intends to charge the bankers' bonuses, which exceed £25,000, once with a 50% tax.
Similar steps are also being taken by France.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prize in all fields, except physics.
Five record women today in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden took over this year's Nobel Prize in the specialist categories and for literature.
In addition to the four scientists, the German writer, Herta Müller, was among them.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine has been awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with her countryman Jack Szostat for research in the chromosome area.
The prize for chemistry has been awarded by the Israeli Ada Jonath, together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for information on the ribosom structure and function.
The last Laureatin awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, which the American Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson received for analysis of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman was awarded a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, the scientists Charles Kao and George Smith, together with Willard Boyl, carried this prize for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital chambers, fax devices or astronomical remote tubes.
Each of these winners has received the diploma, the Nobel Medal and a certificate of the purchase of the money.
This is 10 million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several winners in each category, the money price is divided among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, has already received the most expected Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo this afternoon.
He has recognised in his speech the controversy of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his way, and is also at the top of the country that has two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that wars in certain situations are necessary for the struggle for world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering the resignation. Klaus has invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus receives on Friday morning the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who is thinking about his stay in the government because he does not agree with the implementation of the State budget for the next year in the form that was released by the Assembly of Members on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps the stay of Janota in the Cabinet will be the issues of Friday's meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also further deepens the crisis of public finances.
The president, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate with the Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday about his further stay in his position.
According to the budget law, which is now being signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should operate with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
In Parliament, however, on Wednesday, the Left Party proposals on money laundering were voted on and the money was increased for public officials' salaries, for the maintenance of the social benefits and direct wages of farmers.
The government has stopped the proposals of the Social Democracy that it should cover up the budget deficit.
The left-wing party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right-wing party, on the other hand, has therefore created a sharp domestic political dispute, which raises the question of the further work of the Fischer official cabinet, on which the ODS, CSSD and the Green Party agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, practically liquidates the package of austerity measures implemented by the fisheries government in the autumn, which, according to their understanding, is intended to end the state debt.
Klaus, who can sign the state budget law but does not have to, today at the discussion breakfast with the entrepreneurs, said that politicians have neglected the "serious problem" which is "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances for a long time.
In his opinion, there is no more good solution today.
An improvement could only bring about a strong government, which could build on a wider consensus of the political parties.
The ODS president, Mirek Topolanek, pointed out that the budget is terrible and the government should weigh its further existence.
The ODS position president, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the civil servant's office with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party obviously no longer works.
In the editorial department, Prime Minister Fischer referred to words similar to "strong expressions."
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the budget deficit was terrible, that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that exceeded 200 billion crowns.
As early as Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the State budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeaten" of the world shows a lot of the country, whose fight and victory despite some criticisms, that the main role was played by an American actor.
The story tells about sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic as well as their first black president, Nelson Mandela, represents the American Oscar actor Morgan Freeman in his life history.
Freeman said he was asked by the ninety-one year old Mandela to present him in the Eastwood film.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
I told him, "If I'm gonna play you, I have to meet you.
The seven-year-old actor who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama from the box area "Million Dollar Baby," was already the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which, at the end, became a slave-holder, a fictional US president, and also God in "Evan Almighty," but rarely anyone who is still alive and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was in prison for 27 years for his active activities in the end of apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "undefeated," and at the same time this is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was to speak as he
The film is a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to agree on the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people still remain racial and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes that he can agree his people through sport, so he decides to agree on the rugby players who are one of the world's outsiders.
After all, the South African team is going up to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked on it for several years to bring the Mandela story to the wall of the cinema.
He had no other purpose but to play this role in such a way as to approach it as closely as possible to reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was, of course, to speak the way he did.
The actor said if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I've found that if I shake your hand, I'll take your energy, it'll be transmitted, and I had the feeling that I know what you're feeling, he said.
For me, it's important to be a different person.
In the film François Pienaar, Matt Damon is the captain of the national rugby team in which the white players have considered.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I rang the doorbell, that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, "I look much bigger in the movie."
Despite the obvious differences in the character of the actors compared to their actual models, he has received "Invictus" under the direction of the director Eastwood: "Unbeaten" positive reviews and one also talks about prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summed up his evaluation in the following words: "That was very good history, very good film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light secret about Norway dissolved: The Russians have tested a rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only admitted yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
However, the start was not successful again and the rocket, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, will become a nightmare of Russian generality as well as the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on the ground at the rocket test had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava has mostly not been started at all or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers you already write about "Bulava" as a "rocket that does not fly."
A rocket that does not fly, but shines
This already 13th attempt, ran normal at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that technical damage to the rocket occurred.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time, "Bulava" started from the Atom-U-boat Dmitrij Donskij, which drove under the water of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows the shooting from the submarine.
This is why it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indefinite flying object over the north was actually the damaged "bulava."
In addition, the Norwegian have not doubted since the first moment that it is a Russian missile.
This time, the generality has kept an eye on it and claims that one cannot speak clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fail and the accident only affected the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines were immediately damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test start was made without a mistake, the leadership of the Ministry of Defence only considers six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore fulfills the generality with optimism and it is still claimed that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and will even carry up to ten hypersound nuclear warheads with a total weight of up to 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with the CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
At the age of 51, the legendary defensive player Vjaceslav Fetisov again presents himself in a professional hockey game.
The former world champion, Olympic winner and Stanley Cup holder will help his team CSKA Moscow out in distress, and will probably be in the Friday duel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently President of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas got hurt, we urgently need another defense player.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed to support the team.
We just need to clarify some remaining formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will only concern one game.
I mean, Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morals of other players, and fellow player Nemcinov performed.
When Fetisov comes back to the ice area, he becomes the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, the legendary stormer Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford at the age of fifty-one and was able to benefit from 15 hits and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championships and he also triumphed in Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Cup.
In the second part of his career, he also made his NHL success, where he twice overtook the Stanley Cup in Detroit's dress.
He has been a member of the ice hockey star room since 2001.
Hyundai gave in to the trade unions. All overtime are cancelled
The management of the Nosovice car factory Hyundai agreed with the trade union on the lifting of all overtime.
The union announced the willingness to strike on Monday due to frequent overtime.
This was confirmed by the speaker of the Hyundai car factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unions on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, December 19, voluntary overtime was proposed for the reason that two working shifts would be worked, said Vanek.
The Sedmicka.cz website wrote that the company offered the employees who would work the Saturday shift a bonus of CZK 400.
The employees will also receive this in the afternoons for the Saturday shift of November 28.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of the employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay for the overtime supplement or they can take a leave on 28 December and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek said.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift are paid the fare and lunch.
Taking into account that overtime was the most urgent and burning point in terms of the trade union claims and complaints that had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the lifting of all overtime for the month of December, said Vaněk.
The employees of the car factory had until last week been forced to work almost every day after the eight-hour shift for 2 hours.
As soon as the agreement is signed, the trade unions will withdraw the willingness to strike.
Further negotiations between the management of the car factory and the trade unions will be held on Friday afternoon.
The trade union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree on the fulfilment of the demands and sign a common document, they are ready to stop the strike.
Last week, on Wednesday, the situation in the car factory was very high when about 400 employees spontaneously hit because of continuous overtime.
They also protested against the bad payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management held that the employees had to make the overtime to meet the automotive delivery requirements.
The trade unions also demanded in their Monday call that the employees who had interrupted production last Wednesday should not be punished.
In the field of overtime, the trade unions call for a minimum reduction in overtime work.
In addition, this year they are calling for the payment of 5000 kroner.
The Nosovice car factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
The series production was started in the company in November last year.
By this September, about 80,000 vehicles were manufactured here, and the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works with 'steamed' HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new connections to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts in the viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the connection to common virus variants does not work as much as one of the existing medicines.
The AIDS disease cannot be cured yet.
However, patients can extend their life and prevent the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your administration is accompanied by a whole range of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus reproduction also results in the development of resistance viruses that are no longer effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, the VSCHT (Chemical Technology University) Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to dealing with virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances called metalocarborans act on the protein responsible for the proliferation of the HIV virus.
Metalocarborans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus reproduction in a different way than all the medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists come to new 'improved' compounds, which have been prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
The Metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multifaceted cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms, coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Homecoming and permanent virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the virus's life cycle.
Without the HIV virus division caused by HIV protease, no mature infection virus particles would arise.
When we turn off HIV protease, we also turn off the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the scientific newspaper Journal of Medical Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of connections in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is then systematically changed.
A little weaker, but reliable
The effects of this series of substances against HIV protease have been tested in the reagent glass, including their resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of the metalocarborans on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as that of the clinically used medicinal products, but it does not lose its effect on the resistance variants against which the medicinal products used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action as well as its other characteristics, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical developments, makes the metalcarborans interesting links for further research on the development of effective medicines against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the laboratory for structural biology of the Institute for Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute for Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
The fight for budget. ODS went off on fishermen, who is fighting
The president of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for the next year as "horrific" and the Prime Minister of Jan Fischer's government was to consider its further existence.
The statement of the ODS called the Prime Minister "strong statements."
It's supposed to be time for the analysis.
The Vice-President of the ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the Cabinet of Officials, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party, obviously no longer works.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister has to decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it comes to the fight against the increasing deficit or whether it is his absence in office with the help of the Members of Parliament.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, and that is what Necas has pointed out.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the budget for 2010, but with amendments to the left-hand party over 12 billion kroner.
Parliament has increased the money for public officials' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has been holding back the proposals of the Social Democracy that it should cover up the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should operate with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
The ODS has left the room before the vote, so it has met the government's wish, because the budget that has been changed is only a less bad version of the budget.
Disappointments and senseless
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, has spoken about his disappointment and a sense of senseless, against which Prime Minister Jan Fischer has pointed out that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to resign in the event that the amendments were adopted, the situation would look different.
According to Czech television, Janota has registered with the Prime Minister for Monday after the government business.
He has indicated that he is considering his further stay in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment at the budget negotiations.
The extent to which fishermen are in favour of the further fight against the budget deficit, according to Necas, the nominations of social democracy (CSSD), which had implemented the changes in the budget, have nothing to do with the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-enhancing laws, such as those relating to sickness and pensions or the service-law novel.
Topolanek: The Ministers nominated by ODS were not mistaken
This is a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The Ministers nominated by the ODS have not made any mistakes, Topolanek has highlighted in a text message from the US.
It has mentioned that in some ministries there are people in an alternate position who are committed to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if fishermen decide not to fight the deficit level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that it is based on the majority of the left that is currently in Parliament."
Then he allegedly cannot count on the support and tolerance of the citizens' democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if that is up to date, then I will deal with it, the Minister of Defence Martin Bartak, nominated by the civil democrats, told the journalists in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels at the European Council in the afternoon.
The ODS resigned at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Mr Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget on Wednesday in Parliament if the Prime Minister explicitly asked the members of the civil democrats to allow the budget to be adopted.
We do not feel like an orphan, we are not small children, he then answered the question whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party president in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't realize my voice was missing.
Even when I left the mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be mainly about the Bolshevik of Parliament and the destruction of everything positive, Topolanek himself reacted.
According to the new roadmap of the CD (Czech railway), less trains will be driving at about the same price.
As from 13 December, the Czech railway will end or limit some less outloaded fast and local trains, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total volume of transport will be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new roadmap compared to today.
Most tariffs, including basic and customer travel rates, are not changed.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava area receive several connections to the capital, and the railway uses trains of the type of Pendolino for this route.
The fast train will no longer drive to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less fast trains will also be driven on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced.
The largest reduction is planned by the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (KönigsGraz), a total of eight percent, while an increase can be expected in Prague and the surrounding area.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route are also lifted and on a few days a week the operation of some fast trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis is reduced.
One of the major changes is the introduction of the new direct road from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem have to change.
It is the fifteenth road of the Esko local transport system, which is open thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance routes to the capital will end in the destination station Prague - Hauptbahnhof.
The CD introduces more connections SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperde / Jesenik will be in the time range of two hours.
With the Pendolino, passengers can no longer travel to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's account for regional railway: an increase of 200 million
The rapid trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, the overall railway will receive four billion kroner in the next year, as in this year. The local trains will provide the districts, in total they will pay eight billion kroner in the next year, and the state will shoot three billion.
This year, the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local and fast trains, the railway has re-concluded a ten-year contract, so far the contract has been concluded for only one year.
The rail is praising the system, and perhaps that is why it did not take the form of an increase in the price of the large majority of the tickets.
There are changes only for one-day network tickets CD Net and for cheap internet tickets eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the price of CD Net is increased from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price eLiska will then depend on the drive-by, until now it was uniform for the journey between any district cities and cost 160 kroner.
The Philippine Millitante capture more than 50 people, the children were released.
Millitante today kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some primary students and their teachers.
This has been mentioned by the Agency AFP, which originally informed only over 65 kidnappers.
All 17 children held were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
The abduction was carried out in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 Millitante allegedly used the hostages as a living shield in the escape from the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to issue the remaining hostages.
According to the Agency AFP, the Millitants are part of the New People's Army (NPA), which is the arms group of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police were following the kidnappers for the violence that called for revenge between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the right of standing was imposed because of the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of November 23, which was related to the election to the Board of Governors, there were 30 journalists.
Because of the suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this South Phillippin province and his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
There are also Muslim separatists active on the island of Mindanao.
But those who resumed the peace negotiations with the philosophical government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman a.k.a. Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwood comes into the American cinemas "Invictus: the Undefeated," which includes part of the history of life of the former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been given to Morgan Freeman, who was allegedly elected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
Matt Damon has received the co-performance role of the legendary South African champion in Rugby, Francois Pienaar.
With the film's cinema start, the reactions of critics as well as the public become loud.
Nelson Mandela
His name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on July 18, 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988, he received the Sakar Prize, and in 1993, together with de Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are put in the film because it comes into the cinemas at a time when in South Africa, on the one hand, the preparations for the World Cup are cultivating, but at the same time, the media are shaking the world public with frightening news about the growing racial hatred and the discrimination of the inhabitants by the black majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are for the time being consistently positive, despite many reservations about the occupation of the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is still proud of his own words on the new film.
I have been dreaming about this role for many years and I have prepared for it well.
Several times I met Nelson Mandela personally, so that I can receive his energy, as they say, he performed in the interview after the film's festival premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can get the personality of Mandela and his message with this film.
This is a story of South Africa, but it affects every human being, he added.
In the dress of the Rugby National Team
The film is based on the book by the British writer John Carlin, freely translated 'In the role of the enemy': Nelson Mandela and the game that the people have united, portrays the South African advocate of human rights within his first presidential election.
In the course of the film, Morgan Freeman is trying to bring together two racial and intersected groups, and as Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also plays a role in the South African National Rugby dress at the World Cup, which South Africa won at the time.
For entering the lawn in the dress, which is almost like a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela harvested large ovations 14 years ago, mainly from the white audience and has thus gained the recognition of the white population.
The rugby championship may make it possible to bring the people together to a single people, the rugby player led Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa is improving will only show itself.
However, the white South Africans are skeptical, as in the recent interview for LN the Rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny area transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switchboard near the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
The fire was carried out in accordance with the spokesperson of the Usti nad Labem district fire brigade, Lukas Marvan.
Originally, the fire brigade wanted the transformers to burn out, but later it changed the view and now the fire is removed with a mixture of water foam and special oxygen.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer internal circuit.
No one was injured, the Havarie did not risk the safety operation of the control system according to the company speaker, Pavla Mandatova.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, and the damage will be measured only after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one in accordance with Mandatova.
For more than 10 years, nothing similar has happened to the company Ceps, errors of this kind are rare, it added.
The power supply was not interrupted according to the spokesperson of the company CEZ for Northern Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, and the fire of the trafostation did not affect the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps is active in the Czech territory as the sole operator of the control system, the electrical lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 switching systems with 67 transformers, which transfer the electrical energy into distribution system and line line with a length of 4339 km.
Jancura raises the charges for slander against three CSSD leaders.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today raises a criminal charge for slander against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a 20-minute inteview in the radio journal.
The action is related to the company's efforts to operate regional transport in some districts.
However, all regions have finally signed the long-term contracts with the Czech railway.
All three leaders are attacking us and saying that we are taking out the raisins, and we have only made the offer about the extent to which it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech railways because we would know the prices of the Czech railways that were completed last week.
So we have nothing but to defend ourselves.
Because of this slander of the company Student Agency, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he pointed out that he has evidence from all the districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek considers that the charges for continuing the media show of Jancura, which serves him as a free advertising for his society and for his own person, are being collected.
I am, of course, ready to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I also call on other leaders to do so.
I assume that on this matter too, it will become clear that it is Jancura who is manipulating the public in the case of regional rail transport and using lying and false arguments, said Hasek.
Jancura reported last week that he has invested several million crowns in the advertising that will point to the adverse step of the districts.
He told the radio journal that he was going to stop the campaign after Christmas, and he wants to continue it after New Year's.
He specified that he would lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jancura, after the districts agreed on regional rail transport with the Czech railway and had not made any calls for tender for the contract in a high of 150 billion kroner.
According to Vancura, such behaviour is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
According to Jancura, he was already threatened by a member of the CSSD because of the criticism of the train traffic in the districts.
The only threat was if we did not forget that we could then also lose the bus licences.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don't say his name, Jocura told the radio journal today.
Vaccination against pneumococci free of charge and voluntary
Inhibition against pneumococci changes the inhabited area from January.
It is to be the first for the families free and voluntary.
But already, voices are reporting that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Cultivate the preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococci.
The Institute is already setting the maximum prices of the vaccines to be paid by the health insurance companies.
The experts are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Vaccines for free for August children
From January, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococci, which were born on August 2 last year and later.
The condition is that they have not yet received a dose of vaccine.
If you have started vaccination in the past year or earlier, you have to pay for further revaccination yourself.
The first dose must be given between the third and fifth month of the child's life.
Last year, a quarter of the families had their children vaccinated against pneumococci.
The parents paid 1600 kroner and more for a dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
As a whole, the experts estimate that the health insurance for the vaccine doses spend 300,000 to 450,000 crowns a year.
But they save in the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 a year on all the children's surface vaccinations.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococci cause central ear inflammation, but also severe infections including brain inflammation and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections have caused us to die of up to 28 children up to 10 years of age after a study in hospitals.
Outside the Czech Republic, compulsory vaccination of children against pneumococci was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be compulsory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be a duty in the future.
As of January, this is to be paid by the insurance companies and voluntary.
For example, the head of the civil society Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky, mentioned that the compulsory vaccination would be better.
His association has been promoting pneumococcal vaccination in the long term.
The experts at the international conference in which our association was involved were not very satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
That's not exactly ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have managed to enforce at least that.
I believe that this is the way we have to go now, led Kalovsky.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococci.
At this moment we are not considering this at all, his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen said.
The voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors say.
The chairman of the specialist company of practical pediatricians, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, one could think about the reduction in the number of repeat vaccination "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary vaccination," says Mr Cabrnochova.
The experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococci from next year.
The vaccination against pneumococci is also groundbreaking in the fact that it is paid as the first area vaccination by the health insurance companies and not by the state.
Insurance should spend the money on prevention, thus saving them for further treatment, colds Cabrnochova.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
This, however, is a concern of the practical pediatricians who are concerned about the purchase of the vaccines.
According to the original project, the vaccines should be purchased by the insurance companies and the doctors should receive them in the same way as other vaccines issued by the State to them.
However, some Members feared that the insurance companies could "get the money out of the health insurance system."
The doctors will therefore have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait for the insurance companies to pay them.
According to the estimates, the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
This is not going to be easy, says Cabrnochova.
US artist son involved in "Museum theft"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal 20 million dollars of paintings from his father's museum.
According to the Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught with a trailer when he invited 90 paintings into his vehicle.
They say Frank Frazetta junior and another man used a excavator to enter the museum in the Pocono mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his representation of figures such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
As the news agency Associated Press reported, the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family flaw.
The agency reported, according to a police statement, Frazetta Junior was told by his father that "he should enter the museum with all means to bring all the paintings to a camp."
The agency informed us that Frank Frazetta had refused to grant any permission.
Labour defends budget and tax increases
Ministers have defended the tax increases and expenditure stops announced in the preliminary report against the criticism of the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
The Conservatives said that Alistair Darling had "left" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by pushing out the decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor of the Treasury was also under fire to target workers with low and medium income.
His main proposals include a 0.5% increase in social security and a 1% cap on public wage accounts for 2011.
Social security
The trade unions, on the other hand, have protested that low-wage earners are being punished for a recession that they have not caused and have warned about upcoming "problems."
The increase in social security - to about £3 billion a year - has upset the private sector, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on the economic recovery.
The increase, which is limited to those who earn more than £20,000 per year, will concern about 10 million workers.
TYPES OF THE PRIORITY REPORT
Increase in social security by another 0.5% from April 2011
This year the economy is shrinking by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on bank bonuses
1% increase in corporate tax for small companies rejected
Tax rebates for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase of government pensions by 2.5%
According to the estimates of the Treasury, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be poorer by £90 per year and someone with £40,000 per year will be less than £190, while a person with an annual income of £10,000 will be richer by £110.
Ministers said their target of halving the deficit by 2013 was "difficult decisions," but they also said that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would be on the 5% of the top earners.
Minister of Finance Stephen Timms argued that the outlined tax increases and expenditure stops would be "a drop on the hot stone" compared to the necessary measures.
"These are large figures. They will bring us the halving of the deficit, and this is absolutely necessary over the next four years" he informed the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
Forecasts by the Labour Party on future economic growth - which will influence the extent of new debt and the speed of the deficit transfer - were called into question after the Chancellor of the Treasury was forced to revise earlier figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year - much more than the 3.5% reduction forecast in April - while the debt would be at £3 billion higher than previously estimated.
"missed opportunity"
The Conservatives, who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn against the "debt crisis" of Labour, said that the planned debt of £789 billion over the next six years is untenable.
They added that Ministers have failed to present a credible plan on how they will pay back this and are "cynical" in the face of difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place by June 2010 at the latest.
"They didn't say anything about what they were going to do," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had their opportunity to do this, and they let them pass."
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour is insisting that schools, hospitals and the police should be kept from future cuts, unlike those proposed by the Conservatives, who see the deficit reduction coming faster and sooner.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money generated by the tax increases and expenditure stops is used to cover expenditure for next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are "built on sand."
The political editor of the BBC, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcement - such as the above inflation adjustment for some invalidity pensions next April - the Treasury Chancellor would suspend the accusation of the beginning of the vote, as the money could simply be recovered in the next year.
Labour is insisting on providing extra assistance when people need it most and that the situation will be re-examined in September 2010.
"High budget"
Although the ministers have not announced any budget details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public expenditure will only come to bear in the medium term.
The recognised Institute for Tax Investigations said that the figures of the Chancellor of the Treasury would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly in the future also in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It only shifts the pain to later," said his director Robert Chote.
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, economic advisor to the economic audit company Deloitte.
"This was only the hollow pre-annual report. The markets recognize this."
FBI is investigating "arrests of US citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported US citizens for the suspicion of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in an attack on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Pandchab province, and the American Embassy in Pakistan informed the BBC.
The FBI said it's being examined whether these are the same men that were reported missing in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. State Department said they're also looking for information about the men.
Three of them should be Pakistani descent, one is Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, of course, we are very interested in the charges they are being accused of and under what circumstances they are being held," said Mr Ian Kelly.
The FBI speaker Katherine Schweit said the authority was informed about the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there, if they are actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington reported that the men were arrested in a house that belonged to the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the local police have already been interested in the house before and that no charges have yet been filed against the men arrested.
The news agency Reuters reported that it refused to comment on the arrests, but she said that the US must "work closer with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."
The five students were reported missing by your families in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns "abuse" in Iran
According to a report by the Human Rights Organisation Amnesty International, human rights in Iran is still as bad as in the past 20 years.
The report detailed "abuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
A man who was quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected previous criticism of its human rights record.
Official bodies said that such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and dozens were killed, leading to the largest road protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Dozens were arrested and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
The BBC-Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the abuse claims and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak prison.
But since then there has been no tolerance from the authorities for criticism, said our correspondent.
"Wrong confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and of the protest against the election results.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head. They threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was, still bleeding and half-unconscious, released on the street, told Amnesty.
The defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some protesters who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in August in prison and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that abuses have taken place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been held in a container in a prison in Kahrizak with 75 others for more than eight weeks.
Amnesty recognised that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the unrest after the election and the government's reactions, but so Amnesty, the mandate and the power of these institutions would have been unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 people have been arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
In the city park Skihang was established
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a landmark in Bristol into a competition track.
The ski slopes of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who were fighting for money prices.
At the top of the slope in the Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump at the beginning of a 100-metre long slope.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope, but it was also quite intimidating.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city that shine below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talents."
Awards were awarded for the best pieces of art or tricks performed on the slope.
After the event on Thursday night the snow is left to melt.
Still her and we
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted for a ban on the construction of minarets and the concern about the alleged Islamisation of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a well-founded and well-thought-out report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the most clearly secular societies in Europe - and integrated.
Some readers will read this new book in admiration for the last work of the author: "Why the French do not love headdresses" (original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and well-argued study of a dispute that the country has shared and worked for over a decade and a half and its effects are still to be seen today.
Bowens's latest book offers a more comprehensive and cooler spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutions that now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as it calls Bowen "Islamic Freedoms."
He is a good listener, he gives debates between teachers and students about the questions that concern them most.
Should a Muslim be married in a mosque or city hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it allowed for a Muslim to use a interest-oriented banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profane matters, he claims, which make up daily life, quite unlike the political dramas that the media employ.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
You don't have all the arguments on your side.
The Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who interviewed Bowen are mostly disagreed with their Salafi counterparts - supporters of the purist Sunni Islam, which is associated with Saudi Arabia - which today show a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires a give and take on both sides.
He questions the extent to which French policy-makers (and the intellectual elite, who so passionately guard the separation of church and state) really feel obliged to pluralism.
He points out that Muslims may experience a rougher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who in turn had to make their historical compromise with secular republicanism.
He is more likely to see a "sharpening of the value screws" than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book you are inclined to say "Yes, but not yet."
The most comforting view of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that marks it melts at alarming speed and takes with it life that can't survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have recently entered open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their keel water.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws a natural history of the icons of the North, the polar bear, in "On thin ice."
Enjoyed in the complicated history and politics of the whaling, he describes the long tradition of the Arctic researchers who have proved themselves in the hunt for the polar bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with an polar bear as a brave 14-year-old ensign to the lake, who was only fighting with the gun cobbler of his muskets, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears who were caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought into zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears at a performance.
Even today, zoo plants still have a million of the life of a wild old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the polar bear in Singapore became very green by the algae that grow in the hollow hair of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat to the survival of the species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, the laying continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters use high-performance storm guns in helicopters and motor sleigh-driving inuit to bring their prey to the ground.
Ironically, the ice will remain the longest in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the Ice" (original title "After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine "New Scientist," offers a clear and worrying description of the science of the Arctic and a striking insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of the changes.
But that is not due to a lack of explanation.
The pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century had for the first time shown the confusion of the package.
In the Cold War, submarines measured the shifting degree of underrun.
A useful addition is satellite measurements and the large-scale application of measuring probes on ice mountains, but still much is achieved by unscathed people who camp outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the strange, tiny world of the flow system within the Arctic ice, which is formed by saltwater rinse, which is pressed together when freezing.
But, starting from the bear on the ice to the microscopic little wonders in the ice, all of them are threatened when the summer ice is once passed, which is expected to take place between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months... that could be us"
Marine fancists were among the 6,000 who settled in Arlington Kranze
The high-rise de'Angello Robinson travelled seven hours by bus to put a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other naval fancists who took the trip of Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they entered.
In a few months, from where we're being brought back, we could be, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I'd wish someone would do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to put cranes on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the grape-cane manufacturer Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this journey every year, stop in different cities along the road to carry out events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also set up a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America (cranes all over America), which has also extended the event to other countries.
This year, volunteers put more than 16,000 cranes on the graves in the Arlington cemetery, in areas at the Pentagon, in the graves of the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York and in the memory of the United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation for the second time donated more than $150,000 for the purchase and transport of the cranes.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster said that she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is their way of giving them back something that made the sacrifices.
She said it was a small contribution to help civilians support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family tomb.
Packed in layers of warm clothes, the volunteers walked across the extensive lawn areas and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from the 1st and 2nd World War and the Vietnam War as their goal, as they are not visited as often as the newer graves, the organizers said.
The mood was cheerful, children played and couples held their hands while wearing the fresh pine branches to the gray gravestones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red loop attached to the upper part.
The section 60, which is nearby and where veterans of the wars are buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained almost quiet.
The United Service Organisations donated 1,000 cranes to decorate this section, but the dark mood of the current wars filled this area.
Individuals wept open, others prayed and families and friends held on to each other in the icy air.
Some read out the names carved in stone, while others turned to small black and white space cards that had been put in the wet mud for those whose tombstones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears in front of her son's grave.
She was driven 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio to visit the tomb of Marine Francee Officer David Shane Spicer, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free, my son paid for it, she said.
"If I haven't been in a long time, I want someone to remember him."
Buyers of the US government arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a US government contractor who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been able to be identified, works for Development Alternative Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for customers such as USAID, the US International Development Authority and the World Bank.
Consular officials from the US interest group in Havana are trying to get access to the prisoner who was arrested on 5 December.
The special charges have not yet been published, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything under the charge of "danger."
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include light protests and critical writings, are at risk of arrest.
The anti-government graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community, led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to receive prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase the tension between the Castro brother's communist government in Cuba and the Obama government, which had sought to achieve a "slow" approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy is important for the United States to provide a return when the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and coveted products in a country where the average earnings of a government employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has only since this year allowed normal citizens to buy a mobile phone, they are mainly used for sending text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost a daily wage.
Internet use on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government agencies such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is limited.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few US citizens who are in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press spokesperson of the US interest office in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't give any more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the issue of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the Human Rights Watch group, which recently produced a hard report on freedom in Cuba, entitled "New Castro, the same Cuba," a reference to the use of Raul Castro as the leader of the country that replaced the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants would be arrested, convicted and imprisoned very often within one day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries were moving towards more dialogue.
Pakistani government representatives reveal plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers, and said that they hope that this case could help to uncover an extensive network of terrorist attorneys who are searching the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said that they had been looking for an opaque insurgent, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he found them because one of them had made comments on terrorist attacks on the Internet video page YouTube.
Saifullah became the leader of these men after their arrival in Pakistan and tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Qaida and his terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah could not convince the Al-Kaida leaders that men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern city of Sargotha, far from the ineconomic mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were considered part of a hidden operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government official, who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were not discouraged and were still trying to get the right recommendations to get access to the Al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI - underlines the crucial role of the attorneys in identifying future terrorists and perhaps even more important in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US intelligence service has made it a matter of utmost urgency to place human assets within Al Qaeda.
The recruits of the organization act as a doorman who does not let those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who may be spies.
American wannabe recruits are subject to a special examination by A Kaida, said analysts.
However, due to their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered to be extremely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the top analyst of the NEFA Foundation based in the USA, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years as to who they allow access, because the US intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to get someone into these groups, what better way to go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?, Kohlmann said.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Ten thousand demonstrators call for climate "action" in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets on Saturday and called for cooler action in climate protection by the negotiators at the Bella Congress Centre of the city.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, while the police estimates were about 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists lit small explosive bodies near some government buildings in the city centre.
On a day when the UN-supported climate negotiations were low, thousands of activists migrated through the city with transparency, saying "There is no planet B" in English, and one in Spanish, which said "The Earth says" Enough. "
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the travel to Peru, her mother's country of birth, makes her aware of the heart-breaking problems the country has to face because of the already noticeable effects of climate change.
This is part of the reasons why I have decided to participate in the great demonstration - to pass the word on and appeal to the world leaders to bring about a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it has to be done now and there is no more way around it.
The police stopped the protesters from coming too close to the Bella Centre and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carried pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited in demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be called, as he is involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothes lit up several explosive bodies near the Copenhagen main channel, near which there are several ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, and added that they started as a light rockets, but then were followed by "a few great explosions."
Inside the Congress Centre, people gathered in front of TV screens to follow the demonstration throughout the afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the consciousness of the main functionaries, such as Su Wo, China's chief climate negotiator.
When he was asked if he thought that the demonstration had a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I was not aware of."
He then continued in Mandarin and said, "Because the place of the event is large, I can't hear what is happening outside."
He noted that it depends on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the focus of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "one can also say that they disturb the negotiations or the freedom of other people."
Test data show persistent race gap
The math performance testimonies were welcome good news for the public schools in Washington, D.C. last week.
Although the Washington district is still far behind the schools of the country that produce the highest performance, the testimonies show that the fourth and eighth students have made faster progress in the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent power gap between African-American and white students, both at local and national level.
The average score of the white fourth-class students from Washington D. C. rose from 262 to 270 in the last two years (on a scale of 500), but only three points from 209 to 212 of their African-American age.
The performance gap actually increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the African-American eight-year-olds was basically the same, it fell around a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average white student score was not included in the test data, as the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap, which separated white and black fourth-class students in 2003 when the first NAEP was recorded in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score that children of both groups have reached has grown in this period, the difference has hardly been reduced with now 58 points.
Some of the district's educational supporters expressed their concern last week that the results of the school chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty have been promoted to a large extent by white students, who are already powerful children anyway.
This indicates that we have increased the overall assessment by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, board member of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that is advocating equality of education in Washington D.C..
I do not jump up and down for a range of two or three points, said the democratic Washington City Council member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of the Eaton primary school.
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee, said that the message of the checkpoints is that the city's middle schools need urgent attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
But what frightens me is that we do not spend almost the time and energy we need to use for our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the low-performance students.
This autumn, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new reading plan, the Wilson reading system, aimed at students in the upper classes of primary and secondary school, which have not been able to master the basic skills of reading at the beginning of their school career and which are significantly behind their equal classmates.
Daily mathematics, a curriculum that focuses from kindergarten to the sixth class of games and life-like experiences, was brought to Washington under the former senior school inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is attributed to some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to make the best measures available to the students who are below the level of the grades, said Rhee.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system, while continuing to provide the additional money and resources for the low-performance schools that are necessary to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, Professor of Education at the University of California in Berkeley, studying urban test results.
The conventional cure is to focus its resources and management reforms on schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C..
The objective could create political consequences that are working against this important item on the agenda.
The weak point is, of course, as with other urban school inspectors, that they are trying to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we create a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the urban areas so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to close the power gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with the charter schools.
One must increase the school year to about 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teacher's union last year for 185 days a year, which he considered a "milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than future prospects
The travel bus reaches Gettysburg College with a loud pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, is getting out and blindfold a moment at the sight of the white pillars, the brick stone sad and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela's parents have barely completed high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was saved in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eight students of the group, who explore Gettysburg, where the school costs $38.690 a year, was more of a fearful visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! I will be here soon!" said Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the Führer announced that they had now entered the building for science.
"Wow, really?" she said carefully when she was told about the low professor-to-student relationship of the school.
The college in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the children visited on their three-day tour and now they have fully received the intended message: the question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who do not end high school or become pregnant as teenagers, but on the other hand, there are also hundreds of thousands who receive the college training necessary to get into the middle class.
In truth, one of the five "second generation" of Hispano-American students is closing off college - which is a remarkable achievement, as many of their immigrated parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without having completed high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country's labour force.
Those who study powerful children say that they often have a natural affinity for the school and an innate drive to success.
Many of them also have parents who set their children high goals and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But guidance programmes also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like them to get to college, especially if these efforts continue for a long time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents have no experience and skills to help them search the system, then a single measure will not solve the problem at any time, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California in Davis, who investigated Hispanic American students.
We need to think about making a support network available to these children from pre-school to high school.
The Federal Programme, which was funded by Gracielas College Tour, is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - Raise a course - and provides more than 300 million dollars a year for local school systems to start college preparatory programmes that start when low-income students are in middle school and continue to run until they finish high school.
According to the US Department of Education, the programme has helped more than 10 million pupils since 1999, of which more than 60% have gone to college.
Iraqi Ministry of Oil closes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to rebuild its damaged infrastructure at two auctions closed on Saturday.
The 10 contracts of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil concluded with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralyzed for decades by war and economic sanctions.
American companies were only able to record shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid for participating in the second auction that started on Friday.
The only company that has made a bid has drawn the short.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for auctioned fields in June.
The small-scale representatives of American oil multis at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war, and instead of US companies, Asian and European are setting the way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, which were still highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability by the withdrawal of the US military have probably prevented American oil companies from doing so, so analysts said to be more involved in Iraq, which has the third largest proven oil reserves in the world.
US companies were in some cases disadvantaged because competitors, in particular the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that could conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Larger US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintain close relations with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have been with technical advice in recent years, have gone out empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts that were announced this weekend.
The state of China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and has been able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Oil, Assam Jihad, that China is on the way to becoming one of the great ones in the world economy as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can measure itself with its suppliers and will fulfil its obligations to Iraq.
The pre-selected companies gave bids, which were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil that the Ministry was willing to pay to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Top planner of the Al Qaeda apparently killed in Pakistan
In an obvious US missile attack along the Pakistani border to Afghanistan, a top-level deployment planner of the Al Qaeda was supposed to have been killed this week, US terrorist representatives reported on Friday.
This would be, if it were confirmed, the second deadly attack on a high-level terrorist organisation responsible this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities in the region, were to have been killed by a number of missiles that met their vehicle on Tuesday near the city of Miran Shah in the province of North Waziristan.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired by a type of drone used by the CIA in the lawless tribal belt of Pakistan.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a government representative of a Pakistani civil intelligence service from Miran Shah said by phone.
Local people suspected of being part of the militants ran to the place and quickly took everything that was left of the "completely destroyed bodies."
The local authorities have not been able to confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US counter-terrorism have led to indefinite evidence that Somali was one of the dead.
Somali was described as the leading military planner of the Al Qaeda, who led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracy all over the world, a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, and pointed to the delicate nature of the US air attacks on Pakistani soil.
If one assumes its central role as given, this also included the planning of attacks against the US and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the leaders of Al Qaeda and turned them into operations plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second American government representative said that Somali had quickly ascended into the Al-Kaida hierarchy and maintained best links with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second representative of the government, but this does not reduce the danger he presented to us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somali would be the second leading Al-Qaeda or Taliban leader who was killed since September when a similar attack on Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal area and three other top activists were killed.
The pace of the attacks by the CIA's drones has decreased from an average of six operations per month to two since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a non-profit organisation.
The decrease can be based on improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability while at the same time killing suspected informants brutally, reported the page.
The leading UN envoy in Kabul will resign
The leading UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his office in March, ending a stormy term of office, which was ravaged by allegations of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election supported by the UN.
Eides is being taken away when the Obama government decided to send another 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN Envoy said that he supported the increase in the troops, but he also expressed his concern that the US military withdrawal schedule, which is to start in 18 months, could lead other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the development of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, said Oide in a phone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian helpers to help in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The military-side force increase must correspond to an increase on the civilian-side, he said.
Oide said that he did not set up his office, but only fulfilled an agreement with his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted to notify UNO-
President-in-Office of the Council. - The next item is the report (Doc.
What I said is that he better start looking for a successor, said Oide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has, according to UN representatives, started the search for a replacement.
The UN representatives say that he has considered the Swedish-Italian-based Staffan di Mistura, who has recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who has previously led UN peace operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September to prefer President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and to cover up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Oide has rejected all the accusations, but he also said that the accusations of Galbraith - which was fired - "have undoubtedly been detrimental to the mission because there was already a great deal of scepticism about international interference in the election."
Oide said that he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the aid measures of the American-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also called for the UN leadership to allow its successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries who are sponsoring for the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Oide expressed his disappointment at the limitation of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the difficult UN recruitment arrangements have undermined its ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed so that since May, he said, I could only hire one person.
This is disastrous and must not go on like this.
US Defence Minister Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Minister of Defence Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world's powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran, because he did not take part in talks about his nuclear plans.
Gates spoke on a 7-day journey through the war areas in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of about 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq and played down the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
There are no good options in Iran, he said in response to the question of a soldier about the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things that is on my mind is if we have learned something from Iraq over the last six years, which is its own unpredictability to the war."
The Obama government is considering a sanctions package aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranians.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed to "convince the Iranian government that it is in fact less protected with nuclear weapons" because "its people will suffer from the sanctions.
On Friday, in an opinion by the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the American government joined the European top politicians in warning that Iran will have to expect "credible" consequences if it does not comply with the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear surveillance organisation, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology should be gained only for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that it would resume the talks to limit its nuclear programme and would refrain from a substantial part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has pressed for this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
But Iran seems to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreements since then -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is disagreed on whether to commit to the United States.
The fact that Iran has simply left the international community on some of the proposals that they had already agreed to in early October has, frankly, brought the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, together in a way that they have never been in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, said Gates.
President Obama set the 31 December deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before pursuing other options, including those referred to as "imposing sanctions" by Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton.
In an opinion issued in New York, the Iranian representation at the United Nations condemned what it called on Thursday "unsubstantiated and uninformed claims" by some security council members on Iranian nuclear activities and said that they are ready to continue the talks with the United States and five other world powers "in order to achieve an appropriate long-term solution."
Gates, who was supposed to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before he flew to the rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish government representatives in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, in particular with regard to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict in order to prevent delays in US plans, to reduce American troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to dispel the Kurdish concern about the upcoming withdrawal of troops. US representatives quoted Gates, who said to Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish regional government, "We will receive your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you. "
A change in course in the ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that gave them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain other children" and "A baby more means a grave more."
They learned these lessons so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly began to change course this summer through the low birth rate and the ageing population, and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their answer was direct and final: "No way."
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child there is nothing left, said Wang, 31, a staff leader with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously thick, reconciled single children, who are lovingly called "small emperors," a population crisis in the country is emerging.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy came into force, the UNO-
The number of population groups from 60 years of age and older is expected to rise from 16.7% of the population by 2050 to 31.1% in an explosive way, much above the global average of about 20%.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with an educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-old and older people accounted for almost 22% of the reported inhabitants of Shanghai, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Head of the Shanghai City and Family Planning Commission, has said that couples of the productive age must have babies to "help reduce the ratio of the ageing population and alleviate the labour shortage of the future."
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the developed countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
In the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy should probably be the most controversial available, which has been introduced by the ruling Communist Party to date.
Married couples who are in breach of this policy must expect enormous fines -- up to their triple annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination at their workplace.
Chinese government representatives have attributed it to this policy that the critical demands on natural resources could be avoided, against which human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who have already had a child to abort.
Many couples had also had sex-selective abortions, creating an unnaturally high relationship between men and women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude to one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where both husband and wife were single children -- and in 2007 the tone of many hard slogans was reduced.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that government representatives have recently even discussed more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children with a single partner.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Posters that taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines that describe in detail who is eligible for a second child and how to apply for approval.
The city administration has sent out urban staff and family planning volunteers to visit couples at home and push information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not exactly encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Decommissioning reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outer areas of Shanghai said that a recovery in the applications of couples who want a second child after the launch of the campaign can be seen, the urban districts do not report any change.
For the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, as an example, only four to five applications are still received per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city expected for 2010 will still be around 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai municipality of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want to have children anymore.
They want to give their first best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that this was also legally allowed.
But they have, like many Chinese, only a small health and life insurance of the government.
Without a social network, they say this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West falsely judge the one-child policy as a human rights issue, Yang said, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yeah, we're being robbed of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not simply a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples indicate psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the head of staff, said she only wants a child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and used to take care of everyone.
We are not used to taking care of others and do not really want to. "
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who belongs to a translation company, said it unblatantly.
For middle-aged parents with a double career through which the birth rate is falling, he said, it's about being successful and you have to be selfish for that.
The age group of today's 20-39-year-old grew up to see their parents fight during the early days of Chinese capitalist experiment and they do not want a life like this for themselves, he said.
Also a single child, he said, makes huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the space question -- "You have to change your apartment" -- and life planning -- "When the child is 9 months old, you already have a CV for the best preschool."
Most of his friends are ready to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group draft emission reduction plan
The UN-funded climate conference - which has so far been characterised by wild potions and mutual accusations - has again put a focus on Friday, with the publication of a document, which will record an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with the industrial nations facing the greatest burden in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final policy agreement on greenhouse gas control, has identified both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But he was seen as important progress in a negotiation that is about to take place, as next week more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, which was drawn up by a UN working group specifically set up for this purpose, is silent about the amount of money that rich countries should give to the poor countries so that they can cope with global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large emerging economies can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global temperature increase that policy-makers would contribute to.
The process is given great flexibility, according to John Coequyt, head of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has designed the six-page document, has put together a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's leading climate protection representative, Yvo de Boer, has called "the big whole."
It shows the basis of a possible agreement where the industrial nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25-45% by 2020, compared to the 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15-30% over the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95% by 2050.
The European Community has also given a boost to the talks on Friday through its commitment to provide US $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - from the master of floods and droughts to the prevention of deforestation.
Friday still brought the same verbal fireworks that had determined the talks in the last week.
The American climate expert Todd Stern has rejected formulations that require binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for developed countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging countries, if they are not financed by the industrialized countries.
This train announced that the Obama government is running a harder line with China than the Bush government's representative not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without major emerging economies standing up and taking action, says Stern, who also complained that the text does not go far enough, to ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave his opinion one hour after the Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister He Yafei said that the leading American climate negotiator was either missing "reason" or it was "highly irresponsible" of him that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States would not help China financially to master global warming.
As the future economic direction of the great world powers is at stake, both within the industrial nations and between the industrial nations and the emerging economies have opened up breaklines.
The current fight is also related to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to the rescue of the planet, where China and the United States command themselves for their respective commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the great powers are fighting for who should bear the costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have gone more aggressive in taking the countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions into account for their actions.
This is clearly a game that will develop a new economic dominance, says Ulate, who is also active as a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding Treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will lead to a political agreement in the best case.
The alliance of the small island states with 43 members presented a 24-page draft Treaty on the early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who is leading the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states "is putting political pressure on the whole political process," partly because they are now united and are calling for action from emerging countries, such as China and India.
The talks were given a new urgency when delegates focused on the fact that most of the open questions had to be resolved before the leaders arrived to reach an agreement.
High-level representatives, such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice-Minister, escaped their aircraft and rained through the Bella Center's course to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to cover claims that will be negotiated during the next week.
The pure extent of the meeting -- 13,000 people go into and out of the Congress Centre every day, guitar-playing activists take part in night shows, in which they make fun of the countries that they think are betraying and selling, and draft contracts are handed over by hand rather than by e-mail -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just building up: almost all major ministers are here now and from Wednesday, 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for Global Policy of the Organization Conservation International.
The heavy weights are coming.
Great Britain's first 225 km / h fast train redefines the feeling of assembly
Monday morning at 5: 13, a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce a mission that is a revolution in traffic in the UK.
The first high-speed train in the country will reach the London St. Pancras 225 km / h during its flash drive from Ashfort, Kent, and will take 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, Lady Kelly Holmes will then be on board the first Javelin Pendler service from London.
He hopes that the new UK service will eventually link to an international rail network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large metropolitan areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become living pendler cities, working time would be radically reduced and the change of plane and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three great parties believe in this vision.
But the many billion British pounds required for the construction of a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and environmental concerns could still stop the British high-speed track.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, will submit the report to Lord Adonis, according to the Times, on 30 December.
This will give it a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new line to link London to the West Midlands will pass with a range of five metres in urban areas and in places where the impact on the environment is controversial.
In the open area, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 will also create three options for a larger, north-leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is a Y-shaped route, where a single high-speed line would lead to the West Midlands.
The line would split into or near Birmingham and one branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best functioning option," said a railway insider.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 40 minutes.
The first part of the line, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to return the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to today just over an hour.
The designs offered the trains the opportunity to drive at a speed of 400 km / h, which would make the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was designed to allow 400 meters of long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people to drive on it.
Up to 18 trains could be in operation per hour on the London-Birmingham route.
This would in turn mean that an end station would be needed in London, where 20,000 travellers could be made per hour.
In view of the spatial constraints in the capital, an existing station is expected to be developed to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will tell us whether or not this plan should be continued, but the long-term public consultation and planning measures will mean that a final decision will only be taken after the parliamentary elections.
But even if it moves the wheels, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would have to change from high-speed lines to existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, which would keep the travel time between London and Scotland at more than three hours.
This is considered to be a key point in order to ensure a change from the plane to the rail, a benchmark for the rail revolution.
Tax payers are charged for a mortgage for 75,000 pounds of orange from a conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading member of the Conservatives' house, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangerie that he was able to build in his home in his constituency.
The party's prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron, complained that members of the House must live "of lean rations," has increased his mortgage by 75,000 pounds to build an oak-wood plant at his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest rate, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
Those responsible for the House of Commons approved the applications at that time and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a review of the expenditure of the House of Commons. Last night Duncan said that the requests could have been "not even cleaner or more understandable."
Duncan, one of the richest under-house members, has a two-story house in a village in his constituency Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have reached a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living and dining room, but the Fees Office, an expenditure control centre of the lower house, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he built a winter garden, which is called "orange" in the plans.
Neighbors described him as a "glass house for entertainment."
Duncan was also not invited to comment on the increased use of funds during a recent investigation into his previous mortgage contracts by the Committee on Standards and Privileges.
The Committee cleared him of the breach of the rules last month after an examination of his expenditure.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage of over 271,406 pounds (300,000 euros) from his London house to his constituency, which he had bought in 1991, one year before his election as a Member of Parliament.
This week published documents show that Duncan received about 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) a month as a mortgage interest rate by March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than £1,800 (€2,000) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan's RBS mortgage did not change during this period, which suggests that the total increase was used to finance the money increase of 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros).
The normal non-refundable RBS mortgage rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it is still standing.
The latest documents published by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to claim his right to 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month this May.
Duncan lost his position as an opposition leader of the House of Commons in September, after an undercover reporter filmed him when he said after the spending scandal that Members of Parliament would live "of lean rations."
"It essentially means working for the state that you have to live from lean rations and how S * * * * * e is treated."
He said, "I have spent my money on my garden, and I am entitled to a small portion of what is in it.
And I could have called in all the fucking money, but I'm not. "
The Member of Parliament, a millionaire from his former oil wholesaler's career, was first attacked in May because of his expenses, when it became clear that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden before he had explained with the Fees Office that this could "be considered an exaggerated demand."
An activist, as a protest in Duncan's lawn, dug a hole in the form of a pfundmark after it was known that he had claimed 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When he was questioned about the increased mortgage last night, Duncan said, "This had been approved by the Fees Office and subsequently by Legg for the increase in value."
He added: "There is no debate about evading and going through or bending the rules or the like.
Everything is completely transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It could not be cleaner and clearer at all. "
Come all you believers to admire Brighton's beach huts-adventure calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new living content for the winter months as an interactive adventure calendar.
"Beyond," an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for every December day with Christmas songs as a theme.
The event started on December 1 and visitors were allowed to watch the latest cottage every day from 17: 30 to 18: 30 with free light wine and traditional Mince Pies, filled with dry fruit pastries.
The selected Christmas songs are "I saw three ships," "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël," where the house decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an honorary clergyman of the Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important to people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we expect people to come into a strange old building as a church? I think the Church should go to people and organize inspiring celebrations.
The idea for the beach cottage Advent calendar started as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and living place and we are trying to express this through our spirituality. "
Strong mobilisation in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people have demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen to call for an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate warming, where the police have taken hundreds of arrests.
At least thirty thousand people according to the police, hundreds of thousands according to the organizers, have marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the edge of the United Nations Climate Conference, which should lead to a conclusion by Friday, which could enter into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, the increasing mobilisation in the world for the climate contributes to what is illustrated by these demonstrations that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, had broken display windows with paving stones and hammers, found a journalist of the AFP.
Anti-unrest police officers have intervened immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that, according to you, 600 to 700 people, mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, were arrested in the east of France, in April, in these extremely violent splinter groups that have already made themselves known at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has strongly criticised the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters were arrested "without distinction," and has stressed that about a hundred of you "were still held in the streets on Saturday evening," despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and seat position.
The rather peaceful move has gone from Parliament to the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The protesters have stopped about 500 meters from the building, without trying to get in.
A stage was installed to welcome the speakers, for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the protesters have arrived with buses and trains from the large European cities, but also many Asian people, including some Chinese and Korean, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of you with sky blue raincoats, made a first run in Copenhagen in the morning, as you followed the call of the friends of the earth, "to form blue tides" for "climate justice."
Today, we are going on the streets to demand a reparation of the ecological debt in favour of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, filippin activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't go on and tell ourselves: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, watercourses you can walk, just as it has never been in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Agreement, the movement of globalisation critics has approached environmental organisations.
European Commissioner José Bové, the form of globalisation critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate warming and the fight for a different world."
The Asian-Pacific area, where there are many islands that are particularly at risk from warming, has given the start of the demonstrations.
According to the organizers in Australia, about 50,000 people have gone to the streets.
In Manila there were a few hundred people, most of them students who marched in red and hacked bandanas in which you raised the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or in Djakarta, but also in Canada, there were a few hundred demonstrators to demand a strong approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organised by the network "350" have gathered a few hundred people, in Paris, in Marseille (south), in Lille (north), in Bordeaux (west) and in Lyon (east).
Some people have gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its President, Georgia denouncing that this is a "prank."
On Saturday, Abkhazia elected his President, this happened a little more than a year after Moscow had recognised this pro-Russian separatist Georgian area as independent, and Tbilisi denounced the "prank."
About 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for control of the South Ossetic region, another Georgian secessionist area that was recognised by Russia.
The election offices closed at 5: 00 GMT.
The vote was about 58% a few hours before the election was closed, according to the Abkhazian election committee.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous President, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of a reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the one hand, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakachvili, regrets that Abkhazia is now under Russian occupation, has declared his press speaker, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognised the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceive it as a part of Georgia, which is legally occupied by Russia.
After it had separated from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, with several thousands of people dying, Abkhazia wants to prove by this choice that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, has declared Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen Mr Bagapch.
She was one of the electors who chose to choose a turntable in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the black sea.
Large signs on which Bagapch is to be seen on the side of the Russian President and the Head of Government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are located all over this small area, which has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhazian people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as an allusion to the support of Moscow, especially with regard to the decision to recognise Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, answered and raised a glass of vodka.
The opposition, for its part, which was represented by the former Vice-President and two Russian businessmen, Zous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticised the agreements made with Moscow last year, such as the one in which Abkhazia Russia leaves the control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims neither to support the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus a vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reaches this limit, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos worldwide, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated all over the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagene Climate Conference, where the police, at any time ready to use, have arrested about 700 people on the edge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people according to the police, hundreds of thousands according to the organizers, have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which will receive delegates from 193 countries by 18 December, who are looking for an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
From Parliament the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The protesters have stopped about 500 meters from the center and have not tried to penetrate.
A stage was built to welcome the speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Some moments after the train had passed, a group of demonstrators, dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began to smash in slices, a journalist of the AFP noted.
Anti-unrest police officers have immediately circled you and intervened without consideration by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people were arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent splinter groups that have already made themselves known at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April.
In the evening, a police officer during the incidents, which, according to the police, were provisionally arrested, suffered an injury to the chin by a paving stone. Four vehicles were burned near a occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups under control," said the police spokesman, Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the order forces were in the air.
Most of the protesters who arrived by train or with their own vehicle from German major cities, London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asian people, including Chinese and Korean, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in the sky blue raincoat, formed in Copenhagen in the morning after the call of the Friends of the Earth, a first group to represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice."
"Today we are going on the road to demand that the ecological debt be repaid to the people of the South," said the activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't tell ourselves that we still have time," says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa there are rivers that defeat, there are watercourses through which you can walk, which was never the case before."
The first time in the history of climate diplomacy, launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of the opponents of globalisation has approached environmental organisations.
The French MEP of the European Parliament and the globalisation critic José Bové, said to AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice." "There is no difference today between the fight against global warming and the fight for a different world."
The organization Oxfam has mobilised several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who are turning to the masses.
The Asian-Pacific area, in which many islands are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given the impetus to the demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the organizers, about 50,000 people have gone to the streets.
In Manila, a few hundred people, in the majority of students, have made advertising in red with bandanas, in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital for solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Djakarta, hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France, during the demonstrations organised by the "network of 350," several hundred people were united, especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the fields of geography and history are strengthened by the school reform of the Lycéen.
The national education minister Luc Chatel explained in an interview, which appeared in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dianchen" that the fields of geography and history are strengthened from the school reform of the Lycéen, even if they are not compulsory in the terminal (12th year of school).
"The pupils of the Première (11th year of school) now have every four hours and the same programme," Mr Chatel confirmed.
For the Minister, "this hypocrisy must be overcome," because after him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile," but, in general, a concentration "of the best students."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a subprofile of the scientific," he continued. He said: "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals who would have been outraged by the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical lycees."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanité showed that almost seven out of ten French (69%) are critical of the government's project to remove the compulsory teaching in history and geography in the terminal S (12th year of school with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also affected this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the right.
The Minister replied that there was no question of limiting the philosophy of the programme of terminals.
Luc Chatel also defended the education reform for teachers, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) had called for a protest against the project, which she considered to be the victim of the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister stated that they were subject to a professional aptitude test at the beginning of the year in Master 2 (M2) and at the end of the year an approval examination, in which their teaching skills are examined.
They also carry out internships during the year in the M2 and then teach as a teacher in the internship one year before the students.
He also said: "If you add all the internships offered before the performance exam, you can reach more hours you have spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
The Minister finally stated that he wanted to "offer the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in the education of the people."
He once again confirmed that he wanted to abolish the school card "by 2012."
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the commitment at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change," had to face on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in the Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As a journalist of the AFP found, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, at which experts turn to the audience for 15 minutes with film-based contributions.
One would like to do something to reach people and to give them the feeling of wanting to experience more, Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, on the edge of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name that the students gave to the fish in the pool of the school.
"Among the experts were selected around the twenty participants, even after their charisma," he specified.
"You can talk for hours about climate warming, but the core targets can also be set out in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who only spoke freely with the help of foils before about 50 people.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he stressed in the hope that the listeners might see that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos made by these conferences will be available online on the school page from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is planned for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Late payment: angry prison guards, actions planned
On Friday, the law enforcement officials' trade unions called for a general day of action to ensure that the premiums and overtime paid for budget reasons were paid before the Christmas holidays.
The second union of law enforcement officers ("FO-Pénittiaire"), called on the employees who are not in service to demonstrate and block them on Tuesday morning in front of the prison, to draw attention to the "theft of what they are entitled to."
The third law-enforcement union ("CGT-Pénittiaire") called for "a strong mobilization in the various prisons," on which the non-payment of overtime, night supplements, and Sunday and public holidays in December will become a "shameful and unacceptable" burning market.
The first union of law enforcement officials, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Union (UFAP / UNSA), called for "general mobilization (...) to show the dissatisfaction and anger."
The management of the law enforcement body and the Ministry of Justice stated that overtime in 2009 had increased significantly and not all were provided for in the budget, but they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice said in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the unions of the law enforcement officers to ensure that the payment is made in the next month.
"I am well aware of the efforts of staff to maintain and modernise our criminal justice system," the Minister of Justice informed in this letter.
"I have instructed the Court of Justice to take immediate action to ensure that such a situation, which has been created by a lack of assessment of the overtime, is not repeated in the future," added Mrs Alliot-Marie.
The December wage is therefore lower, except for the management staff who benefit from high service and target premiums, the UFAP / UNSA explains for which the "budgetary constraints" must be maintained.
"This is an absolute scandal," the inter-regional trade union FO in Marseille is outraged and announces "all meetings and appeals" to boycott up to new instructions.
"The staff will not be working on Sundays and public holidays if the hours of October in December are still not paid. This also applies to their overtime," the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne is also at risk.
"At a time when more and more tasks are being put on us without more staff being hired, the attempt to enrich the staff's money is more than inappropriate," said the Bordeaux CGT union.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget, has stated that it is wrong.
Obama thinks he's always sharing Christmas better than he gets himself.
The American President, Barack Obama, who will be spending Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, has been talking to the TV talkmaster Oprah Winfrey about the fact that he is always giving better gifts than he gets himself.
On a special broadcast broadcast on Sunday evening via the ABC channel, the President and his wife Michelle gave an insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrative home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be with the game.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," says Michelle Obama, adding that the dog is also given a gift of course.
Michelle Obama strongly rejected her husband's claims on the quality of the gifts. "I made you beautiful gifts last year," she nailed the president.
"So please," he said, "the first lady's pearl chain," and who gave it to you? "
During this one-hour broadcast in an uninterrupted atmosphere with the well-known TV host Barack Obama had vehemently supported during his campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts that they had loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a ten-course bike and also a basketball that his father, whom he saw very rarely, had brought from Kenya for Christmas.
"I remember when my father visited us for Christmas and brought me a basketball," said the president.
"Only much later in my life did I understand that I had this ball from him."
The first lady remembered her puppet house.
"I didn't know how to order the furniture in a house at all, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace. But I loved this little doll house," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reoperates, RTL confirms that he was transferred to artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operating in Los Angeles for significant "damage" after an operation in France. According to the people around him, the situation was "under control," although RTL confirms that the singer was put into an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was reoperated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles, after the American doctors found "damage to the operation of a tape disc incident" that he had suffered in Paris on 26 November, according to his production company in Paris, which added that these damage would have required a re-operation.
However, the singer's production company wanted to make it clear that the situation was "under control" and said that a new medical advice would be available in 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, the partner during the last tour of the singer, Johnny Hallyday was moved to an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications."
However, only after 48 hours was there a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he opened his eyes added RTL.
At the request of the AFP there was neither a confirmation nor a comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "from certain sources" it is clear that after his first operation in Paris "no drones were laid."
The rocker was operated at the international clinic of Parc Monceau for a tape-disc incident.
The procedure was planned for several days by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available for comments to RTL on Thursday night.
After the surgery of Johnny Hallyday, the singer was admitted to the Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a follow-up infection after the procedure.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, felt to RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through a "deep valley." He assured, however, that "no need to worry" about the rock musician, as he was "a good fighter."
"He called me before he left for Los Angeles. I told him it was nonsense to sit on a plane for 12 hours after such an operation, that's not possible," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the producer of the singer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "responded well to the antibiotics" and that "the infection was contained."
Mr Camus also said that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and he had not felt any particular concern.
However, the concern for the health of the singer had grown ever greater since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after he had crashed on his yacht.
Two months later, the general surprise was that Johnny Hallyday had a "small bowel cancer surgery," which led to a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long tour 66 as a farewell tour as planned.
Since then, however, every health problem has been widely commented on. Fans and journalists have not missed the fact that the singer on stage had difficulty in moving.
It was only in mid-November that the people surrounding him had to depose of a new delivery to the hospital.
Euro-2009 / Short track: First place for Bousquet about its favorite distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medallion winner at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, got an international title on Thursday about its favorite distance, 50m free-style, at the Euro-2009 on the short track in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, on which the polyurethane suits were allowed for the last time, there were only three world records, while a true record flow was expected.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m layers and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50m layers of the gentlemen.
A pity for Bousquet, who wanted to reach the world record at the 50m free-style, whose record he holds in the big pool (20.94).
At one of the two royal distances in swimming, 50m-free style, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed to be in 20.53 seconds. In a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet forced the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he did not manage to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"One can believe in ever greater and in this case I said, when the world record is in my reach, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which are prohibited from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epoch in Istanbul, which began in 1999 at the same competition for the first time.
This time, the use of the combination has not paid off for the German Paul Biedermann, two world champions in the pool this summer in Rome and world record, in the end.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m of free style (3: 32.77), yet he has won the second best time in his career (3: 34.55), in front of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3: 35.75) and the Danish Mads Glasner (3: 36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't get a world record today, but I defended my title and did my job. "
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," said Biedermann.
USA: Grave plate at Zola estimated at 1.5 million US dollars
A Roman grave plate, which appeared in the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated at $1.5 million on Thursday above its value, according to the art dealer Sotheby's.
This record is two meters long and 63 cm high. It comes from the III century after Christ and was always rated at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble, on which "four scenes of the Dionysus in a sophitic architectural decor, surrounded by Satyren and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," said Florent Heintz, Vice-President for the auction of Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby's, on Tuesday to the AFP.
It was sold among hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still in progress, but this part is certainly what the buyers have offered most of the time," says the Spokesman of Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy to the AFP.
The discovery of this purchase of the marble by Emile Zola goes far back.
The record was at home in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, after which she appeared at the French actress Cécile Sorel, who was used in her bathroom in her Paris hotel and at Paul Reynaud, Minister in the III. French Republic and President of the Council, before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next 50 years are in the dark.
In the search of the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of a "heritage of Emile Zola," which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart."
Zelaya's exit attempt from Honduras towards Mexico has been evicted
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the crashed Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to domestic soil to be no more compatible after this passage by the coup government had refused to be unacceptable.
After a telephone call with President Zelaya at night, everything seems to indicate that there is a disagreement about the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, said the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
According to the Immigration Authority, the aircraft provided by the Mexican Government, which had arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of the transfer of M. Zelayas, had returned to its place of origin.
The Putsch government wanted to "thank" Mr. Zelaya and ask him for political asylum abroad.
The President, however, refused to do so because he wished to return to Mexico as the most welcome, acting head of state.
The coup regime "has suffered a new failure by moving me to give up on my costs (...), they wanted me to thank," said on Thursday M. Zelaya to Radio Globo, in which he has often spoken since the beginning of the political crisis that has already lasted five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here well and I like to stay ten years, here I have my guitar, added the President-in-Office, who had fled to the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, under the attack of some chords.
The Mexican Embassy has presented us with a request for action, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not include a request for asylum, on Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of the Interior of the Putsch Government, explained to the Honduran radio HRN.
I did not ask for asylum in any country, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with the channel Telesur, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible exit from Honduras, he had stressed, would only take place as President of the Honduran people.
The rumours of an exit of M. Zelayas had mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the President, who had become the Brazilian Embassy and had gathered around them, and the military there had increased his commitment.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, criticised the position of the coup government.
This, according to his assessment, reveals the marginal nature of this government in the face of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the Socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on 28 June, on the day of the people's debate he organised in preparation for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica he had come back surprisingly on September 21 and had fled to the Brazilian Embassy.
If he leaves this, he will be arrested for high-treason, which he is accused of by the judiciary, the coup government says.
President Roberto Micheletti has succeeded in organising a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr Zelaya.
In the course of the controversial election, Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States, but was rejected by the Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Cogress had voted massively against M. Zelaya's return to office until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street in the upswing, the US's trade balance nourishes optimism
The New York Stock Exchange concluded on Thursday with a high level, the figures of the American trade balance show a price recovery of the United States shares and their partners: the Dow Jones has increased by 0.67% and the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the figures at the closing of the stock exchange, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, the Nasdaq, again dominated by technology, from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The extended index Standard & Poor's 500 was registered at 0.58% (6.40 points) at 1.102.35 points.
There is good news from various sectors, Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotally under the premise that the market is only focused on "half-full glasses," she said.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are mainly focused on the figures of the American trade balance, "which has an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
The United States's trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October in relation to September to 32.9 billion dollars.
In contrast, the analysts had expected an increase in the deficit.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The great news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in goods exports, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, Christopher Cornell commented on business research economy.com.
In return, the unemployment reports in the United States have increased in the last week against all expectations and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, the mean value of new job seekers during the last four weeks had "fallen to the bottom of the year," Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors stressed.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of government bonds to 10 years has increased to 3.482% compared to 3.432% of Tuesday night, while the profitability of bonds to 30 years has increased to 4.492% compared to 4.408% of the previous day.
Cuba: Hundreds of Partisans in Power whistle "Ladies in Weiss"
On Thursday, some hundreds of the partisans who are in the Cuban power, who have come together in Havana for the purpose of the World Human Rights Day, have been extorting political prisoners and, as a result, have also been prosecuted by another rally, which has temporarily arrested a good dozen dissidents.
For the forty "ladies in Weiss," wives or close political prisoners, the government's partisans were on the open road under Raul Castro, just as they were in the centre of the main city on the march to demand the liberation of the political prisoners, a journalist of the AFP confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "mercenaries!," "the road belongs to the revolutionaries!," "There live Fidel and Raul!" the authorized partisans with a high fist ran against the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilians who had appeared to "ensure their protection."
A similar demonstration against the "ladies in Weiss" had taken place on the eve of Havana, where there was no injury or arrest.
On the other hand, a dozen dissidents, who also took up the demonstration on Thursday in the face of the International Human Rights Day, were temporarily arrested by civil police, confirmed a reporter from the AFP.
According to this journalist, the police forced the dissidents of the government's partisans to enter civil vehicles by force.
The temporary detention of dissidents in such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As candidates at the Sakharov Prize issued by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Ladies in Weiss" organised an unapproved march for the purpose of the "request for the release of all political prisoners," the number of which has about 200 persons according to the dissident list, said Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda is in prison for 20 years.
M. Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents who were detained in March 2003, of which 53 are still behind bars.
The Cuban authorities feel that the regime's opponents are "mercenaries" or "agents" in the service of the declared archenemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on the demonstration events that took place on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and "counter-revolutionary."
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of the impoverishment of rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of expression.
Crazy kills eight-year-old with a knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A lunatic, armed with two knives, killed an eight-year-old on Friday at late afternoon at the main business time in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Haute-de-Seine) and injured five more people.
According to the first information of the survey, the 28-year-old assailant had injured the eighty-year-old in or before a pharmacy on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives and this, according to police information, with witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, according to a police syndicate in the hospital, is responsible for the consequences of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he put on a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the three-siders, intervened and was hurt.
The first two victims were seriously injured at the hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injured person is at risk of life, as he, according to police sources, appears to have been affected by vital organs.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events, and according to a police source she has been hospitalized in the "shock state."
The armed man, who, according to police records, seemed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, should immediately have escaped on the road, the same Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have hurt two more passers, apparently by chance: a three-year-old and a four-year-old, while the latter of them were heavy.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two meat knives, which he was carrying behind his back, declared at the site Arnaud Pressé, a member of the Syndicate Alliance of the Haute-de-Seine area.
Several passers, including young people, are supposed to have, according to the witness reports identified by the AFP, tried to banish the madman.
I saw a guy in the three-siders with a green vest.
Three young people tried to intervene.
They didn't make it because the guy was well built, so Alberto reported a waiter of a nearby bar.
A horde fell over him, he added, including a city police officer who broke his wrist.
Still on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of house number 61, two city police officers, including their superiors, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with knife marks, so police information.
The event took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garene, where there are a number of shops.
Passengers have come to me to tell me that there is an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I put her in first-aid position and noticed a beating wound in the stomach area, told Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about three-year-old person, was injured by cut wounds.
State police forces have finally arrested the man who had no ID papers on him.
The Public Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre has commissioned the District Department of the criminal police of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) to report the case.
The crazy one was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source does not rule out being admitted to a mental home.
According to another police source, there were six police officers who would have liked to put him on the Clichy Police Commission where he had been taken away.
He was "in a state of exaggeration" like "all the spiritually confused of this kind, in which the forces set themselves free during the passing of the death."
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for a stop to law enforcement
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski, for the time being on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, Western United States), has called for the prosecution of his client, who is currently in court at his place of residence in Switzerland due to a civil violation of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of the "pianist," has accused three judges of the appeal court in the second district of California of gross procedural errors at the time of the negotiations in 1977.
I am calling for the right to be punished, said Mr. Hummel, before he added that the behaviour of Judge Laurence Rittenband, who was responsible for the case at the time of the trial, "let it run down a cold back."
According to him, the - now deceased - judge knight band, before he fell his judge's claim, had discussed with a prosecutor who was supposed to have told him Roman Polanski deserved a breeding house -- which is a serious procedural error.
This discussion was raised in the documentary film "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and sought), specifically by the understanding prosecutor David Wells.
At the end of September, M. Wells had finally declared that the authors of the documentary had "lied."
If the Court of Justice refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel asks for the conduct of a process that would enable him to provide the evidence of his argument.
The charge, for its part, has repeated the evidence already explained at first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the lifting of the facts put before the defendant cannot be seriously considered as long as Roman Polanski does not appear in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled from the United States in 1978, even before the proclamation of the sentence for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years old.
He has not travelled to the United States since then.
The Deputy Prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had stated that Roman Polanski must "be there to attend the trial."
Do you want to spread the message on this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, who escape is a way out?, asks Mrs Asayma.
In her opinion, "the filmmaker asks the Court for a favor and thus despises his authority."
One of the three judges - who now have 90 days to announce their decision - even pointed out that "there are other escape alternatives."
Hummel was not the only one who had requested the termination of the prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also called for the lifting of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client would no longer bear to be harassed by any relife of the Affaire Polanski and added: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough. "
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September, on the occasion of an American arrest warrant.
After he spent two months behind bars, he was then sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad in anticipation of a possible extradition.
Wall Street is slowed by the rise of the dollar and closes without course.
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday without a course in a market that was torn between better indicators than in the US and an increase in the dollar: Dow Jones won 0.63%, while Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
On the basis of the final figures available at the time of closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased by 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq has given 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The extended index Standard & Poor's 500 has increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"To be honest, the market is rather quiet," said Mace Lichtsilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains very limited, the volume of trade has become very small and I think that this will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than provided for, "which have helped to improve market vision to the soundness of the recovery of the economy," the analysts of Charles Schwab summarised.
In the US, sales in the retail sector increased by 1.3% in November, thus already two months in a row and far more than planned.
In addition, American consumers' confidence has improved significantly in December, at 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the Institute of Michigan's index preview.
However, the indices were slowed by a new increase in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest level over the euro for two months, "pushing down the sectors that are vulnerable to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost some ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The return on the Treasury loan over 10 years increased by 3.540% on Wednesday evening, compared with 3.482% and the bond over 30 years to 4.497%, compared with 4.492% of the previous day.
Election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month's tour of South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World will cross the last hurdle on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world and to watch this one billion years ago.
During this great beauty fair, which is held for the second time in a row in the Johannesburg area, five of them have already taken their ticket to the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were selected as Miss Sportive or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
This was a true structure of pleasure.
To visit beautiful cities, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Hoorn, was just extraordinary.
I've seen a lot of things and I've had a lot of experiences!, said Miss Sierra Leone with all the enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live from Midland, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday, 5: 00 (15: 00).
I couldn't imagine a more beautiful country to hand over my crown.
This experience was just fascinating.
I'm happy to have made this experience twice, Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova stressed in the heat of South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes."
After a month of gala, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the Miss now focuses on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to step into the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present in this election, and to imitate Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywood stars.
It is, of course, the dream of every woman to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but this is not just about the appearance.
We are ambassadors of our country, and I want to come home with the crown, and I want to give Miss India a broad smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition is underlined with music and dance.
The candidates are defiant in traditional traditions and not to be forgotten, in the swimsuit.
The performance is presented by a television presenter, the Chinese Angela Chow, the ex-beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean and a person responsible for the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it is able to receive the world with an unbeatable kindness and pride, assures Julia Morley, President of Miss World.
As last year, the candidates made a safari, the famous township in Soweto, but this time it costs by bike and local cuisine.
The meeting with the South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave their hands to them, was quite extraordinary.
Not usually for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noticed.
Her most beautiful memory, however, is undoubtedly the draw in Cape Town (southwest) to the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to promote a little more for this event.
I'm wrong about people I could probably never approach.
I will certainly come back to the 2010 World Cup, promised by Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive" according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive," his son David assured on Friday when he arrived at the airport of Los Angeles, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, David Hallyday explained to the press when he got out of the plane, where he arrived shortly after 1: 00 local time (21: 00 CET) from Paris.
The son of the singer, who made a relaxed impression, assured him that he would "go to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was sent to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection following an operation on November 26.
The singer was "put into an artificial coma this night in Los Angeles to relieve his strong pain and to carry out his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma by the doctors of the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he was sent to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection after a tape-disc operation on November 26.
The singer had to undergo surgery again on the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the disease caused by the last procedure.
His wife Laeticia took part in a school event at the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where her daughter Jade went to school, a photographer of the AFP.
The head of the department of orthopaedic and traumatological surgery at the Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer in the hospital in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer has heavily burdened the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated on 26 November at the Clinique Internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told he did the most pure massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said they were completely upset, Mr. Camus said.
I heard about the possibility of a trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "travelled to Los Angeles with the permission of the Paris surgeon."
I made a personal call with this doctor, who assured me that he considered this trip to be completely unproblematic, which had surprised me very much, since I already have two tape disc operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he announced to RTL that the singer had apparently left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything."
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artistic environment.
He had the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he was practicing at that time.
In 2007, he had also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematoma after a brain bleed.
But he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, who has been convicted several times because of failed operations and not to be forgotten, because of tax evasion and fraud.
I Olivier Metzner, a doctor's lawyer, has called him "a man without a scruple," who has to be responsible "regularly" before the board and "anything else is recommended."
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This said that the intervention was "perfect" and the post-operative investigations were "normal."
The operation "did not cause bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have occurred since last summer, seems to be in question.
It is clear that it is a little too short for the tour to continue on 8 January (in Amiens), said Mr Camus.
The UDF Party Alliance (Union for French Democracy) is becoming energetic and calls on the Nouveau Centre Party to stop using its seal.
On Friday, the Party Alliance, under the supervision of François Bayrou's Party Modem, strongly responded to an attempt to take over the seal, once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, on the part of the President of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, and called on him to no longer use this seal on a document, under the threat of a judicial persecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, as he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political heritage after giving his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party partner is the UMP, also wanted to reaffirm this strategy before the National Council of the NC on Saturday.
In his efforts he had received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now with NC), who was entitled to the UDF brand, as he was the first to apply for this brand at the Institute of National de la Propriété Industriale in 2004.
However, the office of the UDF Party Alliance under the supervision of François Bayrous's friends broke the silence and clearly understood that they could not be expropriated and set a time limit for the Minister and the Member to no longer use this seal and to give it the property rights of the brand under the threat of a judicial persecution.
In the last few days, you have made many statements that you would propose to your political movement to take over the UDF seal +, wrote the party alliance in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the Modem Party and Senator Jean Arhuis of the Central Alliance.
They also believed that you had the right to have the name of this movement + Nouveau centre +, the slogan + today's UDF + printed on their political material and on the home page of your website.
As you know, you are not entitled to the use of this seal, the UDF's office explained and called on the party NC to "immediately remove the mention of the name UDF from all material and (its) website."
It also called on Hervé de Charette to "transfer the property rights of the trade mark to its legal right to claim."
If you refuse to do so, we will bring an action against you in order to respect the law and to defend the legitimate rights of the UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they stress that "UDF" has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978 and that Morin and his friends have "made a choice" to leave it in 2007 to establish a competitive movement, as others had already done in 2002 to establish the party "UMP."
The party Nouveau Centre has no rights, according to the signatories, to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocracy française).
They continue to recall that the last Congress of the UDF in 2007 adopted the three-year accession to the Modem Party and the establishment of a office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the office continues, "he was not a member of the UDF for three years but of the UMP at the time he applied for the brand name.
It benefits in a scandalous and fraudulent way, from the lack of deposit of the acronym UDF to do this for itself.
You also point out that this lack of respect is in the best way to turn into a crime, and the strategy of the NC is to ironize: "It seems more worthy to us in politics and in life to make a name for ourselves rather than to try to get out of anonymity by, in a fraudulent way, using a name on which you have no legal rights."
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier is condemned for exploitation of weakness
On Friday, the Court of Justice of Nanterre decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he took advantage of a weak moment of the eighties in order to take advantage of some of her assets.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his start photos, will have to be responsible for the exploitation of weakness in court on 15 and 16 April 2010, a criminal offence punishable by a maximum of three years of imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a process in this affair that is worthy of the Saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter fish themselves while at the same time holding the reins of the L'Oréal Cosmetic Empire.
However, the 15th Chamber of Penitentiary ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially under the conditions provided by the Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday will submit a report before 10 March 2010, in which you will clearly state whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she's going to undergo this investigation.
I will talk to her, said the lawyer of Mrs. Bettencourt, Me Georges Kijman, after the trial.
As regards the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the court.
This is an excellent news (...). The opinion will prove that he (banier) has manipulated this old lady, who has to be protected, he confirmed.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has initiated a criminal action against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, and accused him of taking advantage of her mother's weakness for years in order to take advantage of donations of a total of EUR 1 billion in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
On her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always objected to being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considered to be a long-standing friend.
Although the court had to examine the admissibility of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' plaidoyers led to a major family debate on Friday.
For example, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt called for three letters sent by his client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she was suspicious of the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "please explain to my daughter that I have written to Banier for fifteen years, one to two times a day.
I have never been able to speak since she was married. "
The Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre once again considers that the applicant had no right to react in this way, especially because a court judge has refused to initiate a court-martial proceedings against her mother in the last few days.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not protected and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place, "confirmed the representative of the Public Prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court has now decided to give a judgment after the procedure for the admissibility of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers has taken place.
Manager revolution or the end of strategic early disclosure?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the great French companies our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been for nothing...
For over a decade, the attitude of management of large companies regarding its employees, said the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumer before the marketing revolution: It is for the staff to join "values" determined the best as it was previously on the consumer products designed by the technicians in the plant to hang.
By giving the customer in the center of the companies the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquest of the markets in the place... although the authoritarian temptation products separate factors to impose preferences of the customers again regularly!
Demobilisation of employees can lead to fatal demoralisation.
The self-murders of France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of a much larger phenomenon that affects the employees in particular.
This demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, in particular those of R & D, which is even more important, on those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economic = Economic Intelligence) "calls for a proactive approach and a forward-looking view from all the parties involved," claiming a commitment from the employees to which the instructions of authoritarian management completely contradict.
We therefore call for an operational revolution, which would be to put employees at the centre of the company's concerns in the same way as customers.
The very conditional benefits of internal opinion polls
Will the internal opinion polls, as the questionnaire, which Orange has submitted to its pay agents, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I was able to see that, in the face of a new situation, the whole structure, after many detours, is in the process of doing what it has always done, as a matter of priority.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases in proportion to the meaning of its own failure.
And finally, because most leaders have a much simplified idea of human behavior.
This is the first time that the school has been established in the history of the school.
They take over by intellectual comfort the old behavioristic theory, recently reactivated by the American "neurosciences" and unknowingly widely spread by research institutes and through the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to use the "lever" (sic) for employee engagement, a current survey of Ipsos, published by the Ipsos, strengthens the leaders in a position on a mechanistic control system that is not suitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern companies requires the adoption of a final view of human behaviour.
It is to integrate a fundamental protocol into any consideration or practice of management: for wage earners, the commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means of achieving part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At the moment, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this concept of motivation of the employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a given doxa, which allows them to assess what it offers them to achieve their life objectives through their perceived image.
With the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, the managers of the companies can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and place their human resource management back in the right place.
In this way, they create a fertile soil that is favourable to the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The Oslo speech: the "just war" brings praise to Obama from the right
On Friday, the American rights welcomed Barack Obama's speech on the eve of Oslo and was satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives who had mocked the award to Obama on October 9 applauded the President's speech this time, following the example of the former Vice-President candidate in the 2008 elections, Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, said Palin, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the US Today newspaper, and added that she herself raised the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war in her published memoirs.
The war is, of course, the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried to justify the use of violence on Thursday in Oslo; a way of explaining his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, expressed the view that the President had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I thought that the speech was really very good, the former president of the House of Representatives, who particularly recognised the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in Obama's words.
In some parts, this speech was found to be quite historical, said Ginrich, who was interviewed in the radio show "The Takeaway."
The previous Member, who is considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to have seen a "President of the Left," who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they could "not be free and could not give a price for peace if the use of violence did not exist."
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor at Washington Post, Obama has "made a very American speech."
In addition to being a "cosmopolitan," as he always does, "he" spoke like an American president, "pointing out that Europeans" live in a security bubble that they have not created and for which they do not do much, "Gerson said.
Among the few unconvinced rights, former UN Ambassador John Bolton, a falcon of the Bush era, called the speech on the National Review Online website "boring, high-pitched and uninspiring."
To the left of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama is defending the use of the armed forces.
If you pack the war under the cover of justice, the massacre of the innocent can be easily justified, he warns.
The press of the moderate left remains, however, on the President's side.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama early, called the speech itself "monumental work" for a speaker like him who is known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo "offers a progress plan to manage international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression," said the California daily.
The New York Times believe that Obama "announced the necessary discourse" and calls his speech "dark and exemplary at the same time."
Remote drivers: Three marathons for an agreement to ensure the supply for Christmas
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the trade unions of the road association and the TLF - the only employers' organisation that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday evening, which will put an end to the strike order and the threat of a serious supply shortage at Christmas.
At the signing meeting on Friday night, the State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, welcomed the agreement, which was launched on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators broke up on the early Friday morning in the hope that the agreement would be signed quickly in the late morning.
Even though the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours have passed from the beginning of the meeting at 11: 00 until the conclusion of the agreement and the agreement was not signed until 18: 00.
The conflict "would have hurt the companies a lot," and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The agreement provides for an increase of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages is therefore up from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"This is not very much, but we first start small," says Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now instructed not to block the supply centres.
"However, there will probably always be some returnees who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
The TLF President Philippe Grillet spoke of a "good agreement," although it was "difficult to allow these increases in wages in the face of international competition."
According to him, the increase is 170 euro per month for the low and 100 to 120 euro for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on common sense and respect for the employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historical agreement."
Richard Jaubert (CGT) commented on "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel costs and a 3% increase in the overall budget for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will in particular enable the issue to be addressed in the 13th month and the modernisation of collective agreements.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "the reduction of the taxes on employers of EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment by the government to the 2009 draft law on adjusted finances, which was adopted by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday-Friday.
The government calls for "an identical" vote from the Senate.
The TLF's signature allows the agreement to apply first to the companies connected to this organisation and then to the whole level of the profession in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
This will be the case "in the shortest time," insurance Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organisations can only delay the procedure.
The FNTR association denounced "fraudulent trade" because the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for some of the carbon tax."
The State Secretary for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but in order not to break the Gans-Esser on the next Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the Otre Association, the agreement threatens to "throw a large grave to small and medium-sized enterprises in the industry over the next 12 months."
Line REA: Disorders this weekend, trade unions dissatisfied with the proposals of RATP
The disturbances on the RER A line, the largest high-speed rail network in France for the Paris and Île-de-France areas, continued on the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the second day of the strike between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (independent Paris passenger transport administration), the strikers continued to wait with their demands for wage increases.
At this important shopping weekend before Christmas there were no trains between 10: 00 and 20: 00. On the central line (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the central line was only one of four trains ready for use.
The connection to SNCF's trains was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced passengers to switch.
The department store chain Galeries Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP is trying to connect the big business to traffic technology."
The RER A line passes through the Paris conurbation from the west to the east.
The section of the RATP connects the villages of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of two trains was scheduled for the main traffic time, and almost none during the low traffic time.
As already on Thursday, there was no human force on the platforms, as the inhabitants of the Île-de-France had adapted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less overrun than usual, especially because of the lack of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29) said that he had been up "one and a half hours earlier to get to work on time."
The SNCF, which had planned to provide services to passengers by staff and officers, pointed out that no bottlenecks had been encountered at Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by SNCF on the RER A line or towards Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or drove through Saint-Lazare train station to ensure the connection to the Metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, the general meetings of the strikers were again held, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had considered to be "poor" after the meeting with the top of the leadership on Friday afternoon.
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for the REA line on all relevant aspects, working hours, career courses, etc.
This is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud) they demand a long-overdue wage supplement.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP itself put in place its wage award proposals and stressed that the top of the leadership is "unable to solve a problem, while this was also possible for the long-distance drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting on the "comprehensive examination of working conditions" was planned for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers."
In the morning about 150 drivers visited the establishment of a committee in Paris.
It was once again the top of the leadership, which until now refused any discussion during the strike, and suggested a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to extend to the RER B line after an announcement by Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations call for a wage supplement of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépentants). They also complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travellers are travelling daily.
The drivers of the RER line, which have many years of professional experience, receive a gross wage of between EUR 2.200 and EUR 2.700 as well as a wage supplement of EUR 600 to 650 for shift services as well as Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court announced on Friday the dissolution of the pro-Kurdish main party of the country; a decision followed by the immediately angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the government's work very difficult, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community in order to put an end to the conflicts that have been going on for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a "place for activities that are detrimental to the independence of the State and its indivisible unity," said the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç, four days after the decision to the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to impose the resolution, and he also pointed out that 37 of the party's leaders, including the chairman Ahmet Türk and the parliamentary member Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political action for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity, the Turkish and Tugluk enjoy, and the confiscation of the party's goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
The party leaders expressed their views before the verdict that the parliamentarians would rather leave Parliament than meet as party-free parliamentarians.
The decision followed a procedure initiated in 2007 by the Turkish Federal Court Attorney Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya. He accused the DTP of following the "instructions" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is considered by Ankara and many other countries as a terrorist organisation.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has "no connection" to the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The ruling of the Constitutional Court is in between the government, which is seeking to reach the Kurdish community and proposing a number of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to defeat the support of the PKK by the Kurds and to put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP confirm that a resolution could lead to a re-outbreak of tensions in south-east Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the conditions of the PKK's chief Abdullah Öcalan had led to a conflict with the police in recent weeks.
Since the court's announcement, thousands of protesters have gathered in front of the premises of the DTP in the million city of Diyarbakir in the south-east, which is mostly populated by Kurds.
The order forces used tear gas grenades and water launchers when the protesters began to throw molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the judgment, Turk assumed that the decision of the court "will further deepen the despair."
"Turkey cannot resolve this (Kurdish, English) issue by means of a party's ban," he said to the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We are, on principle, opposed to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve the problems, "said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a tortoise of the democratic opening promoted by the government," said the political market observer Ahmet Island.
"One can obviously get caught up in a reaction of the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK was committed to an attack that killed seven soldiers in the north of Turkey three days ago, one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snow break can come
A really crispy winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the winter service manager of the FES.
It is so that his employees can try and learn the entire vehicle technology.
On the weekend, according to meteorologists, it could be this far for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES will follow a precise plan.
As soon as it snows in Frankfurt and temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-routes are off with large-scale vehicles, Brauburger explains.
These include main transport and transit roads such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire-fighting routes, ÖPNV routes, pedestrian zones and routes with valleys, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The service of the FES starts at 3: 00 in the morning
The about 1040 km would have to be scattered in a maximum of three hours with moisture salt, which is more liable.
This is why the FES starts at three o'clock in the morning, "so that the routes are free until the trade starts."
It will be difficult if it only snows at 7: 30.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then no one is ready to make room for the scatter vehicles."
It is only after that, if it does not go any further, that the supply and development roads, including the Council-Beil-Straße, are on the line.
The last priority is side and side roads.
There will be complaints there, white Brauburger.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES 'foot people are on the way, danger points and transitions are emptied.
The FES could not take care of all the bike paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which will keep an eye on the bridges from 22 a.m. to 4.30 p.m., says Brauburger.
As there is a glass on this fast, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the sprinkler is on the way.
If necessary, it will also be called by the police.
The cradle of the dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other meat-eating dinosaurs: the two-metre-long and 1.50-metre-tall animal ran on two strong hind legs, had a long skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would be nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reported Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the Science magazine of Thursday.
The animal lived around 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was in a dry zone of the Pangaea supercontinent at the equator.
Tawa opens a new window to the early evolution of the dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about the relationship, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists started digging at the Ghost Ranch in the North of New Mexico.
We have sometimes found a dozen dinosaurs bones in one day, which is unprecedented for trias deposits, reports team member Randall Irmis from the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as new species.
In the course of the excavation they brought together the remains of a total of five individuals.
Found confirms theories about Dino's early history
The name "Tawa" is from the Sun God of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an extraordinary finding: "Dinosaur fossils from the Trias are extremely rare, most of the time one finds only single fragments."
Other dinosaurs experts do not necessarily share enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of the dinosaurs, says about Martin Sander from the University of Bonn.
After the current teaching opinion, the dinosaurs first showed up about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the allocation of these Ur-Dinos is usually controversial.
For example, the experts discuss when the lizards split into their three main development lines: the meat-eating theropodes, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, which were known as the "long-legged sauropods and their relatives, and the plants-eating ornithischia (bird's pelvic saurus), which included, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropode.
He has an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
At the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of air sacks, as well as the descendants of the theopodes, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of the birds is more efficient than that of the mammals.
In Tawa hallae the bones of the spine were apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropode with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the huge saurods later also had air bags and lightweight bones, the common ancestor of both groups had probably already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs so far lived in South America, the researchers follow that the lizards first showed up there.
As a result, the three development lines separated early and spread from South America across all the earth, which at that time still formed a single land mass as a supercontinent of Pangäa.
The fact that the team, together with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropodes, speaks of this.
The three cannot be derived from a common, emigrated ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe that there were at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
There are, of course, contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonner Paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could be a distorted picture, because in South America there have been a very large number of primitive Dino fossils, while there is little to be found on other continents.
As the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare side line of the reptile tribe to the dominant agricultural animals of the Earth's Middle Ages, it is still mysterious.
During the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and the flight saurers and with many other lizards.
At the end of the Trias, the dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the relationship at the border from the Trias to the Jura died.
Success story didn't last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass death that happened to survive the dinosaurs, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story didn't last forever.
150 million years later, a meteor attack by a group of animals helped to blossom, which had also developed in the Trias and since then has been a shadow life: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The University of Toronto's professors are in charge, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley, California.
There are teachers from Naples, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police clearance of the occupied casino at Frankfurt Goethe University is a global wave.
278 professors and teachers at Goethe University, but also from universities all over Germany, Europe and North and South America, are in solidarity with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" of the police operation initiated by the Bureau.
Uni-President Werner Müller-Estler had had the building occupied by students and lecturers in the educational strike cleared last week because walls and works of art had been smeared.
Five students were injured.
The material damage, the signatories, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organised courses of students and teachers by a police command."
The clearance is a "unacceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the deligitimisation and criminalisation of the protest" and divert it from the content.
The Bureau had withdrawn the necessary discourse.
The teachers call for the immediate recruitment of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupiers did not support material damage, they say.
Protest legitimized
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German trade union union union also solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for your own future, says Verdi-Landesjungssecretary Alexander Klein.
However, Hessen's science minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the actions of the United President and the police.
We are grateful to the President-in-Office.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in the Wiesbaden Land Day.
We have an understanding of the protest, but no understanding of vandalism, according to the CDU country-day member Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition groups saw the SPD, Green and Left.
The CDU takes painted walls to the pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of dealing with the students' arguments and demands, they have been cleared.
The Left has submitted a request to the Minister of the Interior to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital Moscow, was a strictly guarded location for secret arms research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the municipality with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 km from the Moscow centre, is considered "Russian Silicon Valley."
Important research and production facilities for micro- and nanoelectronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had made contacts with the Frankfurt scientific site Riedberg - with the uniinstitutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "Protocol for closer cooperation."
The Moscow Vice-Mayor Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, signed for Frankfurt planning secretary Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the scientific research focus will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is about a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
Fiz companies are allowed to enter the growing Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian science companies want to get orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of important Russian research institutes and companies.
This includes the Moscow Institute of Electronic Engineering, the large companies of Sitronics and Rosssijskaya Electronics.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planning city" for arms research.
Selenograd (literally "green city") received its name from the wooded hill landscape in which the research institutions are embedded.
Stuttgart brake valve
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
The project's supporters are simply about "the new heart of Europe."
Right. S21 is much more than the deep setting of a station, more than a monstrous construction project that will overthrow the city of the Baden-Württemberg State Capital for a decade in heilless construction chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was created by the spirit of the 1980s.
The main stations with tracks that end in the middle of the city were then considered to be the traffic-technical fossils of the 19th century, which acted as brake blocks of a modern rail traffic, as it once took a great deal of time to relocate locomotives from the back to the front.
Let's go, hold on, keep going, keep going.
And that is why the main stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which is about half way from the trans-European rail Magistrale between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - therefore the slogan of the "heart of Europe."
S21 is now actually being addressed, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that in the Hessian and Bavarian cities it is almost priceless to implement the deep laying.
However, headway stations have no more problems in entry and exit since there are modern turning trains with motor vehicles and control cars at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21, together with the ICE new construction line to Ulm, is now being addressed.
National and local politicians have put it through.
The railway is also involved, because the risks of the largest infrastructure individual project of the Republic of taxpayers and not the state group are borne.
The project can still be justified in urban terms.
The new city space is created, which - believe the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of green.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The transit station and the route development are intended for passenger transport, to which was attributed - typically 80 years - huge growth.
At that time, there was no competition from the cheap flyers.
However, modern transport policy must first be about strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than road transport by truck.
But the new line is not suitable for freight trains because of heavy slopes.
Even more serious is that S21 indirectly also plays many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros will be spent in the Swabian region.
That's the official number.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion is realistic.
It is clear that in the next decade the money will be missing at other nodes and bottlenecks in the network.
A total of sixty larger projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of the well 180 km long line through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987, the track has been built in the time-lupto.
It would be urgent to press the tube right here.
But S21 will act as a brake screw.
The Rhine valley line becomes a flask for international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.
Government investigates judgment on the airport
The state government has left open in the Wiesbaden Land Day whether it will review the night-flight ban against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH).
The CDU / FDP coalition has commissioned experts to have the more than 400-page VGH judgment examined legally, said Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
On that day, the VGH in Kassel had written reasons that, in the case of the construction of the planned northwest runway in Frankfurt airport, the country had to reregulate the night-flight ban.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 o'clock, as provided for by the national government, should not be compatible with the legal protection of the population from night noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it is going against the judgment in review.
The opposition criticised this delay and called on the government's representatives to refrain from a review at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD Group Chief Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on CDU and FDP to return to their promises before the election to a night-flight ban. Otherwise, this should be considered a "word break."
It's fucking hard to keep your word, Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir said in a clout on the FDP election slogan "We keep your word."
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer-Gümbel, the government of the country is trying to get to their night flights with "right-wing and trickery."
A precise legal examination takes time.
The coalition did not want to operate on the basis of a "quick first impression."
We need a legal decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As it represents the opposition, his group's statements on the night-flight ban have never been.
US banks pay back aid
The crisis-shaken US large banks are shutting down their state bonds.
The Bank of America paid back on Wednesday the aid from the Bank's Tarp rescue fund of a total of $45 billion (about EUR 30 billion) to one blow.
And the Citigroup also plans to return state aid after a report from the US channel CNBC.
The institutions want to remove the restrictions that have been associated with the acceptance of the money, such as the limitation on the payment of managers' bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had been worried about a good $19 billion of fresh money from investors through convertible bonds.
She took the rest of the sum from her own cash register, which was well filled by, among other things, savings sales.
Bank Chief Kenneth Lewis expressed his express thanks to the American taxpayer on Wednesday night: the money injection has helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had risen to the peak of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also wants to get money on the capital market to liberate itself from its liabilities to the State.
As early as Thursday, the US Bank could announce an increase in its capital of around 20 billion dollars, CNBC reported on the basis of circles.
A Citigroup spokesperson didn't want to speak.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their help.
Quick choice
It all went faster than I thought.
At least two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors had forced the acting editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the station can present a successor.
Last night, the body wanted to vote on the staff.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF-Hauptstadtstudios in Berlin, was the favorite.
However, there was no confirmation from the transmitter - official in order not to prejudge the procedure.
However, it should also have played a role not to further damage the ZDF-Intendant Markus Schächter if this proposal is not to be passed by the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 board members.
The result of the vote was not yet established at the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter, with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years, failed in the Board of Directors.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven against him. Brender's diselection was a dubious defeat for Schächter, but one to be expected.
The majority of the Union in the Board of Directors had already indicated weeks before the election that Brender did not want to confirm in office.
It was organized by the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under Brender the news messages of the ZDF had lost to the inlet rates, he refused a further term of office of the high-ranking chief editor.
Until shortly before the election there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was shaken.
Last but not least, 35 state-law-makers had been involved in the debate, who considered the action of Koch to be unconstitutional.
It didn't work.
To the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
He then worked at the Südwestfunk and the Frankfurt Rundschau.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
Following stations: 1988 to 1990 personal representative of the chief editor; 1991 / 92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and moderator of the "morning magazine"; until 2001 head of the ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF capital study.
The Greens announced a constitutional action after the election of Brenders, who was still elected a journalist of the year by the industry magazine Medium Magazin on Wednesday.
Koch's opposition to the Board of Directors, the Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change the ZDF State Treaty so that staff proposals of the intendent cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, an extract of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of the ZDF also excluded Beck.
Brender's expected successor, Peter Frey, had recommended to the board with a smart move - by criticizing the board for this immediately after the Brender selection.
Thanks to this effort of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate both bosses without loss of face for the post of chief editor and the board of directors, without the suspicion of having a party member in office.
In the party arithmetics, Frey is assigned to the left-wing liberals anyway.
Studying to be dismayed
Partial success for students: After a year of the educational strike, the Ministers of Culture of the countries finally set up on Thursday: At a meeting of the Ministers of Culture and University Rector's Conference, both sides agreed to improve the conditions of study at Bachelor and Master's.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the audit burden: in principle, each study module should only complete with a single examination.
The aim is also to review the workload of students and to ensure "a realistic and reasonable level."
Politics and universities also want to facilitate the recognition of audit services between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structural requirements for Bachelor and Master's programmes more flexible.
There should also be no derogation from the national rules.
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Minister of Culture and the University of Rectors have been wearing the flying word of better student ability in the mouth.
Now it was filled with a concrete content for the first time.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to reduce the number of tests in part drastically: "Each module usually closes with only one test," it says in a 30-page paper, which is intended to partially reregulate the admission of study programmes.
With the "significant reduction in the audit burden," the Accreditation Council President, Reinhold Grimm, said, was to "stop a misdevelopment which significantly affected student ability."
In addition, "studibility" will be "the key criterion" in the design process.
In this context, it should be noted that, in the first place, the training of students in the field of education and training should be carried out in a way that is consistent with the objectives of the programme.
This is not the case.
The students would "claim to have room for manoeuvre, which would allow and promote their own initiative."
The rules should apply to the admission of new programmes, but also to the review of existing programmes.
These need to be "reaccredited" every five years - which means, however, that it will take until 2015 until all the courses have been reviewed.
For this purpose, ten accreditation agencies are in the country under the responsibility of the Accreditation Council set up by the countries.
The Ministers of Culture had "urged" the countries in October to influence the agencies in such a way that the substance is not too large and the audit regime is not too strict.
In some federal countries, universities and higher education institutions have already agreed with the state ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country to date, Rhineland-Palatinate provided additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
The main aim of the money is to set up tutoring programmes and to strengthen study guidance and audit and foreign offices.
Countries and universities want to spend EUR 10 million on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to bring a new version of the higher education law to Parliament.
After this, only one study will be necessary to complete a study model.
The aim is to make study design more flexible and to ensure the recognition of evidence of performance at other universities and to facilitate access to the master.
By the end of next year, all the country's programmes will be reviewed for their eligibility.
The government and the opposition had again fought on Thursday about the conditions of study in the country.
In addition to praise, however, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Executive Board of the Juso higher education groups asked that the design of education policy should no longer be "behind closed doors" of the ministers and university rectors.
At the latest, after the educational strikes, students should now also "take a word for themselves."
The future academics received support from the President of the University Rector Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermanz: "We need the students' experience," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture with which the HRK discussed a common reform paper.
The education and science union (GEW) did not go far enough in its overall decisions: it calls for a legal right to allow every graduate with a Bachelor's degree to have access to a further master's degree.
On the other hand, the countries must ensure that there are sufficient master's courses with the best possible conditions for the current generation of Bachelor students tomorrow, according to GEW board member Andreas Keller.
The countries need to recruit significantly more teachers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express their opinion on a more free access to the Master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Incoming to Germany and out is pretty almost no control... "is the starting line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which this in disturbing language flaws addresses the arrival experience of a dissident who has won freedom but at the same time lost his language space.
Born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, Werner Söllner had first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publishing house before he moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded several literary awards, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt poetry lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessian Literature Forum in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
Last Tuesday, he made a significant extra-literary appearance during a meeting in Munich, which was about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and in the mirror of their security records."
Söllner, in his capacity as an IM for the Romanian Securitate, has been in a position to give a clear and clear statement to his colleagues in Romania, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
In 1989, Söllner received the German language prize together with some of the people present.
The recruitment attempts would have started in a slippery way, first in 1971.
I am, closed Söllner, "so someone who did not fight against intimidation of the Securitate enough."
The poet Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize Prize for Herta Müller and its unprecedented literary discussion with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene, and in particular the community of the German authors from Romania, is shaken by a case that makes the abyss and the downright of a political system based on monitoring and harassment.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can tell, not only the perpetrators, but also the victims, as far as we can tell.
In his securitation file, IM Walter played a role, said Söllner's confession of literature scientist Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
He "hauled him out" in all the difficult points for him at that time, according to Markel.
It was a moral need for him to make this comment.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in the form and in front of this audience, but it is not surprising that an earlier dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian intelligence service is a promise.
Germany had been a comfortable reserve for Securitate-Spitzel, Herta Müller had already written in July, after reading her own file, 914 pages.
The people concerned, as you may imagine, are speculated and in some cases they have also known what is clear behind the cover names Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the fact that the Stasi files are now a very process-proof view in this country, the handling of the legacy of the Securitate surveillance is still very diffuse.
Systematic education has been defied and hindered in recent years.
A National Council for the preparation of the CNSAS was established only in 1999, but the issue of the files has been rather slow since then.
It is only since 2005 that there has been a law governing the administration of the files.
The fact that the influence of former security members in Romania is still very large, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, an interview was held in which a former security boss from Temesvar, who was in default, spoke about the prize winner.
She has a psychosis, after all, she was only interrogated once.
The infamy of power was to be able to express itself in the form of freedom of expression.
It is certain that the Söllner case, as so often in the context of the silent debt, is linked to inevitable questions.
Why only now? Who has been harmed? The supposed response of the listeners to Söllner's confession makes it hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by knowledge rather than by debt allocation and shame.
To the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Satisfaction additional Champions League
It seemed like an adrettdressed outdoor service man was coming from a very nice Christmas party where a sports product manufacturer had distributed Goodies when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the equipment, went into a class of C after midnight.
The man with the striking gloom let himself drive because of his still foreign city.
Otherwise, he could have driven himself - alcohol was not in the game, and the 55-year-old was just as little drunk.
Had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work will continue.
Or get going.
In the words of the Swiss only three days before: "We have reached the eighth final," namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3-1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success: it will be a brutal hard fight against the descent."
The "much more important task" is to be done on Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat in Mainz the royal class performance in the league daily life.
And to set off the weaknesses that were revealed again after the fast three gates by Marica (5), Trasch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Retrieval
The eighth final of the Champions League (Hinterspiele 16 / 17 + 23 / 24 February / Replay 9 / 10 + 16 / 17 March) will be released in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy of the full-mindedness of the Babbel successor remained.
Not only the supposed healer who had given the unsecured Stuttgart professionals confidence, willingness to use and joy in the short term.
I went to the players and told them to reflect on their strengths, and I encouraged them to be more brave, said the soul-plumber Gross the simple-sounding success concept, which had not had any effect under therapist Babbel.
He has created a certain magic, admits Babbel's supporters Jens Lehmann, "if a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you didn't think were possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a week's break of injury, was the best player on the square, tried to describe the "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way the new supervisor works: "He is a man who is going through and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation. "
Under Babbel, it had obviously been unarmed.
The VfB Stuttgart is not over the mountain yet, warns sports director Horst Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart, however, needs above all constancy.
Like Gross, players and managers were careful to overassess the victory against a replaceable and completely overhauled defense of the Romanian guests.
They would also have won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen the evil awakening had come, Khedira gave consideration.
And the sports director Horst Heldt warned that while one season target was reached, the other was still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
On his 40th birthday, even after the first home victory, Heldt had not had to celebrate for three months, was the event of the weekend, which was fresh in the form of a television interview by Torhüter Jens Lehmann, which was broadcast immediately before the start of the game.
There are decisions that make others and not Jens, Heldt presented the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the board of a lack of leadership and had decided to change the trainer on pressure from puberating fans.
Also that his free day after playing had been deleted, Lehmann considered as a sign of lack of sovereignty and misfortune.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure egoism," and Heldt returned and announced consequences for the final man.
You're not gonna be friends for life anymore, the two four-year-olds.
After all, they agreed with all the others that without the preparatory work by the replaced coach team the playful and militant strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants "had a great deal of success," said Heldt and Lehmann unisonio - and also the man with the plastic bag agreed.
WM-Fight in weight
Hot duel in Bern: repeatedly provocative challenger Kevin Johnson world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended its weight title after the WBC version.
The judge's judgment was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains box world champion in weight.
The 38-year-old champion after the WBC's version of the association defeated the American Kevin Johnson in the night of Saturday in Bern unanimously after points (120: 108, 120: 108, 119: 109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Before that, the Ukrainian was twice the world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it didn't work out with the C.O. that everyone was expecting.
Klitschko was able to make a record of 39 victories in 41 professional fights, and twice he had to give himself up because of injuries.
In the 24th fight, challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat.
Before about 17,000 spectators in the Bernese Arena, the 2.02-metre Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight with its left hand.
The 11-centimeter smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, was always away from the beating of the world master, so that Klitschko could not bring his dangerous rights to the goal.
In total, passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to get over the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his battles only rarely met the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went with Klitschko over the full distance of twelve rounds.
Before the fight in the Swiss capital, the challenger had caused some invertebrates.
He insulted Klitschko as "ugly zombie," who "can't do anything right."
When he was weighing, the champion was then provocated on Friday to push Johnson's sunglasses off his nose "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years of time off, he had then beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and brought back his "WBC-belt," which he had to give up before without a fight.
This year he then forced Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September Chris Arreola from the United States.
I only got one blow in this fight and am physically very good in shape, Klitschko had founded the quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
The WBA's belt, however, is worn by the British David Haye, after it was able to uncover the 2.13-metre-large Nikolai Waluyev in November.
In the summer, Haye had previously cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko, which was planned for September.
His PhD company is already planning the fight against Klitschko in the London Wembleystadion.
Kunduz case
Front attack from the opposition: Green Group Chief Jürgen Trittin has called Defense Minister Guttenberg a liar for false information on the Kunduz affair.
SPD and Left call for information from the Chancellor.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest findings on the air attack of Kunduz, the opposition defense minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has been subject to a conscious deception.
The Minister had said "knowingly the Intruth" on the deadly bombing of two tankers in September, said Green Group Chief Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news show "Day Show."
They call it a country-by-country, he lied.
The order to kill was given in violation of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the report that NATO has had, which Mr Guttenberg has read, said Trittin.
On Friday, it was announced that the attack was not only about the destruction of the captured vectors, but also about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
According to the Nato investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured in the US air attack requested by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein.
Green, SPD and Linke on Saturday asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy - and whether the office of Chancellor, Federal Defence and Intelligence have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green colleague Renate Künast asked.
The government speaker Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor's Office did not influence the concrete operations of the Federal Army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also doubts about the presentation of the Ministry of the grounds for the dismissal of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneider and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg have been properly and fully informed about the background to the Tanklaster attack.
Officially, they said they denied the existence of the Nato reports and kept sensitive details from the Minister.
The two top officials said, however, that they even referred to the Ministry of Defence several reports, including a two-page document by the missing Colonel Klein and a field hunter report.
In the meantime, Wichert has asked for clarification in a letter, the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung" reports.
He has not received an answer so far, it is said.
The Ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this would be clarified in the Committee of Inquiry of the Bundestag, which intends to make itself known on Wednesday.
dream worlds
Some see images in the awake state and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the mentally ill and in the drug rush, the boundaries between imagination and reality fade.
As long as it happens in sleep, it's all right.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark rooms, we can give ourselves the wildest ideas and imagination.
However, those who experience, in the wake of sad conditions, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are usually considered to be crazy or drug-addicted in the modern Western world, at least as a special.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the case of mentally ill people or in the drug rush.
The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels sometimes make the boundaries between dream, truth and reality fade.
Traumely changed state of surveillance can occur in a variety of forms, at best we call them visions, in the worst case truth.
Even if the triggers and effects may be different, the visions of the mystic Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic deceptions, psychosis and hallucinations can be traced to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the neuronal bone substances of the brain - especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is debilitated and the interaction of different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The gravity has no power over him anymore.
The connection of faith and dream has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in the wake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, established in 1861 a "great resemblance of madness with dream states," for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the intransitions, delusions, sinnests of such."
It's autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and even-colorful.
Gravity has no power over him anymore, he's floating on the ceiling of the room.
He's feeling a kick.
Behind him winged devil-shaped with blood-red, distorted fragments, teeth-flushing.
They hunt him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over the body.
Loud, evil voices are pounding out of walls and radio.
He can't stand them anymore, the voices that insult him and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from the stereo system, pushes them to a loop and fastens them to a hook on the ceiling.
He goes up on a speaker and he puts the loop around his neck.
Jump.
The sling is dissolving.
This shall be a lesson to you, and the voices in the trombone-felling choir shall cry, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizophrenic-paranoid psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, he takes drugs, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his disease, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and the deepest despair, he says.
The Trugbild are cruel reality
About one percent of the population has schizophrenia at least once in life, and in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, those affected can no longer distinguish between the internal and the outside world, they are in an overheated state that can lead to hallucinations, scale, relationship or persecution.
The voice is particularly common - voices that command, comment or dialogise.
Also optical hallucinations are not rare.
The affected person can no longer separate important from unimportant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded by impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis also opens the locks to a flood of ideas and fantasies that come from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subjective, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the General Psychiatry Hospital in Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is located in the center of the event, everything has a focus on it.
At the same time, it becomes a passive role, it is, like in the dream, overwhelmed by the events and cannot make them active.
Schizophrene therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A balance of reality is not usually possible for them, the true images are cruel reality, the awakening is excluded.
Once in life to have experienced a hallucination
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the sensual and spatial structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remains in principle."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are in reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in a real context.
Why exactly our brain is beating capriols, researchers are still putting up with riddles.
Exceptions can lead to a short-term loss of reality among every person, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic tendency to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the alone determining factors.
Researchers assume that there is minimal brain damage in those affected.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, by a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, for example, explains fox.
But it remains a mystery how the disorder of the neuronal system is achieved, which, in the first place, does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be a trigger for psychosis when the disposition is present.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis as they intervene in the transmitter system.
When our brain is hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get them, says the Lübeck Psychology Professor Erich Kasten.
It is often only a question of the point of view that whether or not the truthfulness is felt to be pleasant or unpleasant is a matter of the point of view.
Box has been collecting reports of hallucinations and guerrillas for ten years, and last year he has evaluated his results in the book "The Irrational World in Our Head."
Hallucinations are one of the typical manifestations of psychosis, but also of surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, these often include diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's and skull brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brain of healthy people is hallucinating.
Hallucinations, according to the box, are made up of memory contents that are normally held back.
They arise when brain areas in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or too little inhibited; when our brain is hot or even if there is no stimulation.
Drugs can cause this condition as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But also rice, stress, love grief or other mental exceptional states.
In recent studies, up to one third of the respondents indicated that at least once in life they had experienced hallucinations.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and visits the high school there.
A normal girl, actually.
If there were not the pictures and voices.
In the break it can happen that a sleepy boy with long, dark hair is talking to it.
When it answers him, the students look at it surprised - no one else sees or hears this boy.
You think the shy girl is a spun day dream, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows that.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
Am I crazy?, she sometimes asks herself.
But she knows that this boy and the other guidebooks are not real and disappear again.
At night the apparitions are usually frightening
It is often a burden to the trustees.
When she sits in the classroom, she can sometimes not follow the teaching material, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just presenting a new student, while he explains mathematical equations for all other hearing and visible at the table.
At night, the apparitions are usually frightening.
When she is waiting for sleep in her dark room, which is too rare and too late, she often can't tell whether she is awake or already dreaming of the pictures she sees, the scratches or the girl with the bleeding cuts on the arms and legs, in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she'll yell at the shapes.
Parents and friends don't tell them about it, they'd think they were crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed the degree last year and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she's been in contact with the psychologist's box on the Internet, she knows she's not crazy.
True is also a work of art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or is suffering from irritations, he is likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Kasten.
I guess the brain will be underoccupied and it will make it even his conversation.
Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man she calls Dad since she can think of is not her physical father.
As visual and acoustic hallucinations are active the same brain areas that also process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult to distinguish those who are involved, such as Sarah K., from those who are concerned. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, and reality forms there.
Hallucinations are also images that make the brain develop, so they seem so real. "
Also at night dream images value castes as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenia, psychologically healthy people are able to recognize their truthfulness as irreal.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to appreciate the hallucinations as a special ability.
Limits between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our too much consciousness-centered world, imaginary experience is mostly pathogised, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy of the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a severe, suffering disease, but it also has positive, creative - fahn is also a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called uneiroid form of experience, a special form of traumatic change of consciousness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams that the experienced person considers to be real and which he cannot distinguish from the state of guard after all.
The uneiroid state of consciousness arises in trauma or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis in full consciousness.
When a human being is threatened with self-loss and world loss, for example through persistent, complete inactivity, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with a self-imaginary world that is decoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of boundary between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to deal with a situation in reality, there is a world change, but the real situation is presented in the imagination.
An intensive form of sense foundation and sense in an unbearable situation in itself that allows us to have our own design capacity not to go down in a nothing of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his Oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzweksel" as a life-saving action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness goes on a journey after a heart valve operation with subsequent heart transplant for days, while his body in the intensive station is condemned to inmobility.
Claussen is immersed in a self-created world, visiting foreign times and places: he experiences himself as a bed-ridden, old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot is watching over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages under nobles who produce smoke from blood.
If a Greek is towed on the motorcycle in his home country, he surrounds with his hospital bed in the firnschnee of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
He goes completely up in the imaginary event, everything is real, even later in memory.
These inner journeys differ fundamentally from any dream for Claussen.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
On the other hand, the memories of mental travel are very clear to me after years and in detail.
More clear and intense even than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience is blowing the horizon of our other life-worldly experiences, says the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In the end, uneiroids, psychosis, hallucinations and drug rush show how fragile our inner images of the external reality are also in the guard.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist takes a box, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snow break can come
Burda
Children should take over the publishing house at the age of 27
The new head of publishing Kalen is an intermediate solution: in the long term Hubert Burda wants to put his company in the hands of his two children, he told the SPIEGEL.
The holding is expected to be 100% of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the long term in the hands of his children.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, the 69-year-old told the SPIEGEL.
We have taken care of the details of this matter.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is only about that.
The question of whether they are able to do so.
It is not possible to put 7500 employees in charge of their children if they are not sufficiently qualified.
This will kill the children and the company will kill them.
Burda announced on Thursday that he would withdraw from the board of directors from January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kalen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kalen has been a member of the board of directors at Burda since 1999.
He was first in charge of technology.
Later, with the treasury sector, the responsibility for the company's assets was added and after the extermination of Jürgen Todenhöfer also the responsibility for direct marketing, abroad, pressure and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the top of the publishing house.
The children of Burda are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The name of Kallen also serves to bridge "10, 15 years," says Burda.
The holding should continue to belong to 100% of the family, said Burda.
With regard to the cases of fate and Schaeffler, Burda said that even family companies were not safe before the fall: "This always concerned families who were infected by a capital search that had been completely speculative and thought that they could become a very big player.
My strategy was never.
He has "never had world-power dreams," says Burda.
I do not see myself as the political preconceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I do not want to play in the World League with 'Time', these shops have become too big.
Perfect beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now at your disposal.
This is at least what El Corte Inglés has done, which has recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m ² in the shopping centre in Callao (Madrid), in which everything is all about body care.
In the wellness area, which is located on the eighth floor, you will find, among other things, renowned companies such as Hedonai, which provide a hair-drain with laser; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a fitness studio or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food department that, through its tea house, produces more than 130 different tea varieties.
To enjoy a relaxing massage together with your partner while having a fantastic view of the capital, or to rent the relaxation area for two hours to put your own "beauty party" on your feet with eight friends and then to relax in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the many possibilities that Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m ², which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments and for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulite or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has these types of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training units of the customers and offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training unit by entering a personal password on a touch screen that is opposite the devices.
After that, various videos show you how to do your training sessions properly.
The director of the fitness studio assures that 15 minutes (including heating up and stretching exercises) are completely enough to train the body muscles.
If you want to pass the hair salon after you have trained your body, the company Luis & Tachi has a room in which treatments for the recovery of hair beauty, shine and health are offered for your hair in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. in the evening 365 days a year.
The most diverse decolletés
Christmas is getting closer and so it's a good opportunity to copy the look of the stars and get their festive dresses in our wardrobe.
The form of the decolleté, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
Here are some proposals.
The singer Fergie has chosen an excessive and very complicated decolleté. You can only guess about that.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the city of Barcelona, has created the "LIVE office."
This is a project to develop and promote the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE office" (logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the road map for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements on mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidising, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed to promote the electric car and to summarise opinions and measures in the areas concerned.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
Barcelona is not, however, the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also participating in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to speed up the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote the activities of research and technological development in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among other things, those related to energy and, in particular, their performance.
However, it is not the only initiative in which Endesa takes part in the promotion of the electric car.
The company is involved in standardisation groups across Europe and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of peace" for the automotive sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, prophesied the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country's largest exporter, "a horizon of peace."
When presenting the 2009 economic report by the President of the Government, Zapatero once again recalled the measures that the government has launched to support the automotive sector in the course of the year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the car industry, today we would have a panorama of neglect and closure of some of our main production plants," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of car manufacturers to continue to produce in Spain in a very competitive industry in the future, we can see a quiet horizon for the future of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), has provided EUR 800 million for projects by 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn made investments of more than EUR 3 billion.
The head of government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also stressed the government's measures to boost demand, in line with the 2000 Plan, which are applied in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and the car manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows for an average reduction of 6% in the exhaust gas of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in the authorisations that increased "by 40%" in November.
On 20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classical Automotive Fair, an exhibition for professionals and lovers of the world of engines, will be held in Madrid.

Mazda3 i-stop: environmentally friendly sport
Mazda wants to prove that sportsmanship is quite compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and start-up system of the engine, christened on the name i-stop, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of Mazdas 3 is based on its good grades in the overall picture.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its road behaviour, the mechanics, the i-stop system...
All these aspects are "very good" in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats you can see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good hold.
The game of the steering wheel is also excellent.
When looking at the unit, which consists of the instrument panel and the dashboard, you can see that Mazda is in the most exciting colors red and blue with a variety of buttons and switches, on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style reminds us in part of the style of the Honda Civic.
That is why it can be said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the flaws of the German cars, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which all want to exceed.
The passenger room of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort to allow four adults to drive the car in a comfortable way.
All of this comes a large and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and start-up system is now only available for the 2-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-gear switch.
This engine is a real pleasure. It is created by its fineness, by its quiet sound, its performance and by its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometres a year should consider this i-stop with petrol engine because of its great comfort in gear and low consumption, even though in Mazda the diesel models are the most sold.
With regard to equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the test drive is a special feature, as it has a much larger number of elements from the series equipment.
The RVM, which thus removes the dead angle, as well as the control elements for traction and stability, speed control, light-sensitive internal mirror, the on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio-Bluetooth, as well as the chromed 17-inch rims, can be found in the series equipment.
In addition, this version also includes, as if that were not enough equipment, the Premium package, which includes the following for additional 1,500 euros: in addition to other elements, the learning bixenon headlights and the BOSE sound system with CD-charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-stop is one of the best compact cars in the class.
It is particularly outstanding with regard to the materials used, because of its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
Moreover, those who do not spend many kilometres a year can also buy the i-stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative of this model is its somewhat high price, which is between EUR 21.770 for the luxury model and EUR 23.270 for the tried and tested model Sportive.
However, in return for this high price, the Mazda3 offers us the new highest driving fun every day.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red carpet of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine," the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, more than ever. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe," as elegant as always, chose a dark "lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device with which you can only read your e-mails without a possibility to see certain attachments or to surf through the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of glory when it chose the magazine Time to be one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is rather unlikely, but the idea itself is of particular interest to young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example only half the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After the company has seen the success of this, it has put two new devices on the market: one that is only intended for Twitter, the other with a life-long free service for data, quite unlike the peak where you have to pay a six-time higher price.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, however, has a surprise ready.
The monthly maintenance price for the telephone, about 12 euro per month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to give up all the data in order to read their emails once you have crossed the national border or if you are desperately looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flat rate is incredibly seductive and should have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for foreign stays, but in my experience you already need a doctorate in physics and good glasses to read all the small-printed ones.
The repeated criticism by the European Commission on affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe has almost always been ignored.
Outside of your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails and that is right.
That a small device like FonPeek (which is always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it does not have Wi-Fi) can offer this type of tariff, means that the telephone providers have to think slowly, but safely and start to consider different ways of using their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, and his prices include the download of books and other requests on the Internet.
No vets and no hooks.
This is an Internet-capable device and you only pay for it once, that is, when you buy it, and not month after month.
And that is exactly what I expect from FonPeek one day, a purchase option with life-long Internet access as it already offers in the United States.
And not because I want to buy it.
I read my e-mails by phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I believe it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The Fetishcolor of Michelle
Yellow is no doubt the favorite color of the American First Lady.
As soon as Barack Obama became President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and has chosen the same color to accompany him at his, without doubt, second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama was wearing very similar models on both occasions: except that it was almost the same color - a shiny green yellow - the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat of the same fabric, and in addition she was wearing a little large-sized embroidered or a necklace.
It even happened that at first sight it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes are very different in the kind of fabric they are made of.
At the inauguration she was wearing a lace dress and in Oslo a velvet made of mustered velvet.
The accessories were also different: for the first time, green shoes with half-high heels and for the second time an anabolic model, but gold colors.
The hair was also different every time: the hair was put up as a hair wreath on this occasion, and the hair was open in the previous one.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the result of the study "Fertility and career of women in Spain," carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years of age makes no doubt about this: 75% of women in work see their career in the labour market limited due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are major differences in the decision to set up a family and the number of children, depending on whether or not women work, and if so, what kind of work they are doing.
Those of them who do no other work outside the house, only work half-day or have no fixed contract of employment, become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with a firm job, especially in the public sector, are moving the creation of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 with a fixed job are given their first child on average only 3.7 years after the date of the meeting, a number increasing to 4.1 years for women with a fixed job who have taken longer to achieve this and who have only achieved their first and first child much later.
In addition, the type of work also has a major influence on motherhood, although less than the calendar regarding the willingness to conceive, "explains the CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account when women are aged in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, age at the time of marriage and the first child is the higher the level of education.
This difference was also observed among women of the same age.
For example, women in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, depending on whether they have only primary education or higher education, were on average at 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time.
There is also a further difference between women, depending on their level of education.
While the women with the main closure are already getting married before their first fixed position and having their first child, the women with a middle or high school degree are doing it exactly the other way around and are first looking for a permanent position and then getting married and then having their first child, Delgado finds out.
Diane Kruger is worth it too
L'Oréal Paris has recently added a new name to his all-enlisted list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the widely known expression "Because you are worth it."
The main actress from "Joyeux Noël," one of the most elegant actors at international level, will thus become another famous exposition as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her were the last to join this exclusive club, the actors Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
Among the men, the cosmetics company has only exceptional emissaries: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy ') and Matthew Fox (acting colleague of Evangeline in" Lost ").
The award ceremony of the British model industry
The British have an important word to say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
They all appeared on this occasion.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was elected the best model this year.
The poker game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker der Asse" (Alfaguara, pictures of Fernando Vicente) the three X-rays of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and in some cases also in real life).
He does not use a predictable and terrifying genre (short biography, life and work), but is looking for a sensitivity to the burning heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent does not save on terror or enlightenment.
Besides that this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving invitation to read and read over and over again.
Here are some cuts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When reading his pages I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual drive, just as I have always felt it, without having found words for it: the joy in contrast to the incurable fate, the morality without guilt and the innocence without any God."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between fainting and ignorance, with an amazing poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife sounds that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was drawn by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years to the extent that the flesh in which the emotions of adultery united with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of coming to heaven on the way of destruction."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in 1922 in Paris by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the 800s summits in world literature, one has to climb up on the north wall, on the wall on which the best climbers try again and again. "
About William Faulkner: "He was a funny guy.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the heir of a landowner of the county, and another time he said that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of a certain size. "
Over Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the crazy cry, which was screamed from a bridge from that personality from Munich, so that his echo could be heard in his literary way until the night of the 20th century. He did this on a journey on which he fled from himself and with a speech full of violence from the worms, he begged the afterworld.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeled and prayed," My God, I ask you to do everything in your power, that I may stop writing like a woman. "
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave these verses of Spencer are engraved: 'the sleep after the effort, / after the storm of the port, / the peace after the war, / and after a full life you will find pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "She always had her depression in her luggage.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Eduard VII was spying them between the azaleas or singing the birds in Greek.
There is no other case known where the man was so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was much greater than her madness. "
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín-Santos do than try to get Joyce into Baroja?
What did Benet intend if he did not lead Baroja to the weapons of Faulkner?
What did Cela do, except to destroy the glory of that man, so that he could put himself on this podium? "
Fake aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood in the village of Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years of age ran next to her and our dog, our dog is a mixed-up that we have taken out of the animal shelter, which weighs just six kilos, and then out of the hot sky they missed him two steps and hurt him hard.
Our indignation cannot be expressed in words, because it is incomprehensible to us, because the fun is to be in a cheap agression against a small and helpless animal, which of course was carried out on the leash.
In addition to that, the suffocation that a woman who went for a nice walk was getting when she wanted to justify these people because of the incident, she was even afraid of her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he might also do the same with a woman, a child, an older Lord, or possibly even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet district at five o'clock in the afternoon on a normal Tuesday.
The dog's been crying all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint at a nearby police station, but we have great doubts as to whether this will bring anything at all and to prevent any prejudices from the beginning, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spanish.
Our indignation about what happened has led us to show this incident.
We cannot understand what must be done in the minds of these young people, that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for the animals and the people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially among younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of the use of helmets, as this is ultimately the only element of protection that can prevent head injury or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "covers far more than just the design and production of products that are becoming more and more safer every day," and further confirmed that they also contribute to the achievement of this goal by other actions of educational and informative character.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmet on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops in a first phase to achieve the best possible dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and precisely because they are always committed as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles, that one of their main objectives must be the development of ever-safer products.
The sale of small trucks is increasing again
After almost two years, the car market for small transporters finally starts to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% in 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first ever to grow after 22 consecutive months, according to the figures presented by the manufacturer's association Anfac and the car dealer's association Ganvam.
However, these good figures are currently only to be enjoyed with great caution, as the reference data used for comparison are November 2008, which was a particularly bad year of sale with a 60% decrease in the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total registrations of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this number includes all the vehicles made up of the retail transport market: arrivals of passenger cars, pick-ups, small transporters, small vans and lighter small trucks / chassis.
Furthermore, the same thunderstorms in the sky are still most affected by demand, because even if some of the vehicles are bought by private individuals, the large part of the sales to small and medium-sized enterprises that in almost 100% of cases make the purchase with third-party financing.
These restrictions, which are the result of the credit institutions' money havens, must include other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In this panorama and in contrast to the passenger cars, the financial support for the purchase of a 2000E vehicle has helped little.
However, this plan is not only intended for private individuals, but also for self-employed and small enterprises, if they want to buy a small transport up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emissions that may not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
It was just yesterday that Ganvam had reminded us that it was essential for the state to pay special attention to these small trucks as well as, of course, to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The Automobile Association has announced a similar year for 2010 to the previous year, for which it expects a sales loss of 19% (for passenger cars and ground cars).
Support for brake manoeuvres in critical situations is now compulsory
As in the case of the ABS anti-blocking braking system and as is happening now with the stability control ESP, the emergency braking systems need to become a mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly approved passenger cars and light small vehicles, and for the remaining vehicles a period of time has been set until the end of February 2011.
The aim of the action adopted by the European Union is to improve the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many road accidents due to their operation.
The task of the emergency brake assist is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical brake maneuver which the system recognizes on the brake pedal using the brake strength carried out by the driver.
However, this system does not exercise this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, one third of the drivers involved in an accident did not get to step on the brake pedal before the collision and half of them had not fully stopped.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The brake aid, on the other hand, is used with maximum force in the braking system and thus reduces the braking time and therefore the brake distance that a car provides during the braking process.
According to a study by the EU, up to 1,100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are affected could be prevented every year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assist.
There would be even less accidents - it is expected that any fourth accident could be prevented with personal damage - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that (via radar or a camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, while at the same time it already has a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver responds, the system will help him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is already inevitable, the brake assistant shall exercise the maximum pressure on the brakes in order to minimise the damage.
General Motors moves the plan for Opel until January
While the staff of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that he needs more time to complete the Opel rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new President of GM Europe, is trying to ensure that the side concerned gives its approval to each of the points of the plan in advance.
And for this reason it may be that the final document, which will be submitted first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are works, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that it will take a decision on the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American car manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with some possible new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who would also like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports cars, which is covered by the Russian group Converg, is becoming increasingly popular.
If none of these buyers were to have an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will continue to be maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and really managed to make it easier by 80 kilos, making it now only 1,275 kilo on the scale.
In order to achieve this, they were the first to forget about the automatic folding roof, which was replaced by a tent roof with manual drive, so alone you saved 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model, such as the GT3 "disappear" another 15; by removing the air conditioning again 13; also, the fuel tank has been reduced from 64 to 54 litres, thus saving another 7 kilo; by installing sports bacquet seats again 12 and again with the light 19-inch rims.
Then another six kilos had been reached by the release of the audio system CDR-30 and by the replacement of the door handles by handles made of fabric the missing kilo.
Although it is also available with the PDK dual-coupling gearbox, the test drive was carried out with a vehicle with 6-standard hand gearbox, mainly on the smaller roads of California, on mountain routes that were really very curvy.
In his driving behaviour, he can only be given the note impeccable.
However, the reduction of his weight has not led to the fact that he would not be so safe on the road now.
It is rather the opposite: for a long time we have not tried such a small and light model, but it also gives you a feeling of great safety in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a little athlete, able to warm up his muscles in a low course in the necessary time, until we give him the orders to race, to brake, to recover and then to get everything out of his engine again...
He does everything they tell him, and the car does everything we can to him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to his control, which is as communicative as it is precise.
And he's doing it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) has been very successful and you can even increase it with the 'sport' option as well as a system that can change the engine noise that has already been used for the first time in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is unimaginably brutal, whether out of standing or in re-accelerating.
The suspension is strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the land roads on which we were driving with the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car was well master of the potholes.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the whole track, even though we found ice in the morning and in the morning.
In summary, it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving fun, as otherwise it is rather rare and in it is much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster S.
The car will be on the market in February 2010 and will cost EUR 70.831.
Bag Girl '
The singer, a bus friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the Cosmetic Line Coco Cocoon and an opportunity star at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same collar rigidity as her pockets of Chanel.
A lot more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl," she's a "Bag Girl."
The Basconia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboratory, despite the many outstanding players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, celebrated an excellent triumph with 82-91 on his visit to the complicated football field of the Maccabi Electra and thus comes first in his group after the great appearance of Mirza Teletovic, who was eight times the best of his team (29 in the review).
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the major failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of use and teamwork, even if they had to wait for their victory until the bitter end.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 rated triple contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the blue red, which sat down at the top of the display table from the beginning.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria were already coming out of the perimeter, one could already see that they had come to the field with well-arched wrist joints.
It was English and Teletovic, who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the team from Álava decided to play an inside game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, who was received on his return to the team with peppers and applause that is his home to further expand its advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic has already started to be the best of his team with 13 points, even if the "minus six" assessment of splitter could already be found that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
However, despite the clear advantage in the break, the game was still far from decided and the macabees wanted to remind the Vitorians once again that on their field of play not everyone won, and thanks to the ever-attacking "hand of Elías" they came back to the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed significantly to the "yellow" turning the rudder (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured but anything but dead, had to prepare a few games with meeting security to get back to air and one of them suddenly came the gun of Mirza Teletovic, which with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas made it possible to show a reassuring distance from (54-67) on the display table, which the host could embellish at the end of the third quarter with (57-67).
The Alavesen were exposed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away from them the victory they had really earned in the first three minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not sign up and tried to give their team power again by three points from the line (70-77).
However, and although Splitter was set off because of Fouls, the team of Ivanovic did not give up, defended himself well and although the Israelis still picked up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being offered the forehead
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to take the lead in group B of the Euroliga to him, and this was marked in a game that was characterized by the failures of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the indoor game, which made it easier for the Greeks to win.
The team from Málaga was not afraid of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship, nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their offered game in the first quarter, the Andalusians were allowed to start dreaming. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, the hosts blended with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the first Unicaja, even if the local team with an inner play between Bourouis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed to show in their favour in the 13th minute 22-20, the minute in which, due to an action, it almost came to the battle between the two Americans, Beverley and Williams, and for which reason both were disqualified.
The Greek team began to get warm at last and his superiority on both sides of the game, while the exodus of the English Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-caused mistakes of Carlos Jiménez left clear traces of Unicaja.
Among their players in the inner field and the Lithuanian foreplayer Lina Kleizas, with its triple, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A catch-up hunt was impossible
The third part of the game was characterized by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which, despite its 19 losses, proved to be superior and even managed to offset the difference in the game of 66-48 in the 27 minute, which in turn made the leadership within the group in a swing.
Unicaja tried to get over the many failures and the extermination of the Scot Robert Archibald who was injured during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for Unicaja, in the 31 minute thanks to the feather and triple of Cook and the use of Lewis, there was again some hope of 66-57.
However, it was actually impossible because the Olympiacos, as soon as it attacked and showed its superiority with centimeters within the basket area, was not to be stopped.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed in the 37th minute to increase the basket difference to 81-62 and Unicaja had to give himself up and had to take the lead at Olympiacos.
How much should you make on Facebook because of your profile?
Facebook users can now experience their salary due to their profile thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the salaries of the users on the basis of more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. Users can enter a form in Facebook to which their profession, professional experience, age and city in which they work.
After a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found out that the Spanish worker on average feels "badly paid," said the person responsible for the product Trovit, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spanish are the worst paid according to the data that Trovit has through its search engines in the UK and France.
A British programmer gets an annual gross salary of 45.226 euros and a Frenchman 31.059, as opposed to the 24,000 euros a Spaniard deserves.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net content of EUR 34.247 in England, EUR 25.751 in France and EUR 16.420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is that of a waiter with an annual rate of 11.592 euros net; followed by the work of a seller with 14.725 euros and that of a worker with 15.667 euros.
The most wanted places on the Internet in the last three months are the ones of a driver, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in her message in Tegucigalpa.
The President of the Office shall leave the diplomatic representation by 27 January 2010at the latest if his mandate is officially terminated
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to the television station TV Globo that "Mel" knew that before that date he had to leave the message in which he had found asylum since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to go on January 27, as his mandate is due to expire on that day and he has to find a new accommodation."
The station also quoted the ex-President, who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the specified date: "My position is to go as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the government of Brazil," said Zelaya on the phone.
After the elections on 29 November (in which Porfirio Lobo was the winner), Zelaya assured that he would stay in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to get refuge in Brazil.
This failed, however, to recognise Zelayas's refusal to recognise the status of an asylum-seeking politician who was to be forced by the de facto government, chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you.
After the most tempting days of the past spring, when asset inflation was the dominant mood in the markets, uncertainty has returned on the markets, which is in no way surprising, as this is their natural state in an environment where brokers make decisions about a natural future.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to settle the debt with the direct purchase of assets and to leave it indirectly free of liquidity at interest rates that move around zero so that banks can buy assets for settlement.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are almost finished and, without questioning their heterodox policy on liquidity, are beginning to scatter some sand into the transmission, as BCE näc has already suggested with its annual auctioning taking place next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we are currently witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock exchanges and the differences in company bonuses are increasing again, even though they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to nationalise private risks and government debt is rising again.
It is now based on quality, and the US, Japan and Germany are the preferred place of refuge for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the countries of the euro area in terms of Germany.
Spain has not been affected by this episode of instability yet, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision down on the assessment of Spain.
On the other hand, a certain degree of uncertainty does not harm to silence the defenders of the moral risk that had once again tried to raise awareness among those responsible for global economic policy, for what they had caused, because they had inhibited the devastating effects that the limitation of loans led to the loss of jobs when they were supposed to have decided on a new day of thanks.
Nevertheless, what has happened in Dubai points to a tribal war between the Emirates in order to restore power in the Emirates and the development in Greece has been previewed before.
A government that is not in the state's debt, elections and a new government that is in the same line.
In Italy, Prodi made it to Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It does not make sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from the non-compliance of its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and thus to allow a euro Member State to no longer fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to take its citizens in the need for exceptional measures to maintain the stability of government funds.
Yes, we are, as expected, facing an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some exclusions of too high amounts, that would now be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in public debt increase at the same speed as European corporate bonuses.
However, if European differences were to be reduced and the Spanish further increased, this would be a specific Spanish risk.
The one of Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the indicators that have been drawn up here require a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their scenarios for recovery and to correct their scenario up for 2011, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which again come up with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all this does not promise a long life, despite warnings.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment "caution while driving" is called for.

The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear before Parliament's subcommittee yesterday, where the strategy on the energy supply of Spain is being discussed in the next two decades.
After his performance, which was followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some key points about what he had presented to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the President of Iberdrola, Spain will have to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and a further 60 billion from that date until 2030, with the prospect that the current nuclear power plants will continue to operate.
If this were not the case, the investment needed would not be 60 billion but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that one should no longer invest in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international associations.
From 2020, the question will change and the performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon capture facilities and, of course, on renewable energy.
In this case, it is expected that 18,000 MW will be needed more, under the terms of reference of course by other "support energies."
Galán, who believes that the draft law for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, is in line with what his company has called for, did not want to say anything to this law about how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all policy strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, this direction is clearly defined, despite some" individual "measures, as the President of Iberdrola said.
If it is as it is, Galán thinks that the decisions on investments, even if they are long-term, should be made already, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" of Aer Lingus at ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for services at airports on the ground, the Swiss Swissport, is the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for the luggage service at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, which has not yet been published, is set up for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol yesterday to cooperate to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructure.
The alliance plans to invest 20 million by 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the Centre's tasks will be to examine energy efficiency at motorways and airports.
Acciona is competing with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market where they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to be established in the country as a construction company and motorway operator.
The city administration wants the construction completed at the end of 2014.
After the administration had decided on a public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) to drive the project forward after a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for the construction and the toll station administration.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investment amounts to $1.7 billion (EUR 1,047 billion), with three consortia, in particular European construction companies, competing in the last phase.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second is based in Italy, one of the best specialists in civil engineering.
The Northern Direct consortium, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, is responsible for infrastructure and the French Bouygues.
The third and last consortium, which is in the narrow choice, is called LBRJV, made up of the capital of the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the local building stone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian market for infrastructure promises huge construction work and privatisation, but has to overcome a hurdle, as it is only through the purchase of a domestic construction company that you can get access to.
A strategy followed by the above-mentioned companies Hotief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and still needs to be followed by the Spanish construction giant.
Even ACS has received access to this market only through its 30% stake in high-speed vehicles, the owner of the above-mentioned Leighton.
millions of assets
Acciona is of the highest importance in this geographical area for the industry, where it is already well known as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry because of its activity.
Among other assets, it already has its largest wind mill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies to build and manage Adelaide's desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
It is now intended to consolidate itself in these two areas and to use these synergies to get access to the construction and infrastructure sectors.
The underground toll line, which is promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and is called Northern Link (North Zubringer), has the purpose of connecting the western motorway in Toowong with the bypass road in Kelvin Grove (see map) on a length of 5 kilometres by tunnel, which is the largest measure to reduce the dust on the Brisbane road.
The roadmap issued by the city administration provides for the award for summer 2010 and the start of the construction work in December next year.
Even if this toll line is already to open to traffic in the last months of 2014, it is expected that the construction work will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two tracks in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government is involved in the financing with 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros).
Brisbane is ready for a great deal of business.
Australia is giving significant orders to Hotief, who signed a contract with the government of 154 million yesterday.
The ACS subsidiary will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with glass fibre cable through its local subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will create a fast Internet access for 400,000 people and will employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the construction project of the King George Tower with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. The construction work has not yet started and Hotief has received 129 million for this.
In the United Kingdom, Manchester, it is also competing with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools to 25 years.
The initial investment amounts to EUR 75 million.
FCC receives the order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has acquired over its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 km in length for a motorway in Slovenia over the sum of EUR 64.5 million.
The company received this contract only a few days after it had received the contract for the construction of the extension of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of the construction work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its implementation will take over 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertising budget from Renfe
Renfe has allocated the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore over a total of about three million euros per year, the railway company announced.
In this contract there is also the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies that presented this competition, of which 4 came to the final round, among them TBWA, which has been responsible for advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
More than 63 million for France Télécom for the break-out of competition.
The competition regulatory authority in France has imposed a penalty of EUR 63 million on France Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has limited competition in fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, price plans and loyalty programmes for consumers on the margins of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has collected more than 560 million euros in penalties since 1994 for its competitors' disability.
The penalty imposed yesterday has even been increased, as the authority that watches over the competition believes that France Télécom has committed similar violations in the past and has therefore become repayable.
Trade in applications
On the other hand, the French company's subsidiary has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trade page on the Internet to increase the revenue from transactions that do not result from the telephone connection.
In principle, this website of Orange is active in France and the United Kingdom.
It is necessary to wait until 2010 for this victory to be available to other countries, such as Spain.
The match with the Champions League has been in Madrid and Barça since the beginning of 476.4 million.
Since its creation in 1992, the Champions League has developed into a source of revenue for the football club.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since taken 476.4 million, which brings them the third and fifth place of the football clubs that have made the most money in the league.

To win the UEFA Champions League not only brings fame, it is also one of the main sources of revenue from the big clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has distributed up to 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (of which 12 Spanish) who have participated in this event since its foundation in the 1992 / 1993 season.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is located in third place in Europe, which has made the most money through its participation and the only one who won the trophy three times next to the AC Milan.
The last winner of the former European vacuum in 1992 is the Catalan champion.
The list is based on Manchester United and Bavaria Munich, two teams that also receive the most money through their participation in the previous Champoins League.
And that, though they have lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only in third place of the countries that were able to take money by the Champions, although it has more titles than all others (five, as opposed to four bie Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complex money-sharing procedure used by UEFA.
In this year's financial year, the organization, whose chairman is Michel Platini, is expected to have a revenue of 1,090 million by the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA provides 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that participated in the qualifying round (among them the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
Moreover, those who were fighting for participation received 3.8 million by their mere presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they contested.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for an indecision (400,000 per team). The clubs that have come to the eighth final receive three million each, the four that have come to the quarter final, 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner deserves 9 million, as opposed to the second, which receives 5.2 million.
For example, a football club will receive at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million fixed revenue.
Barça again made 2.5 million with his victory in the European Supercup in August.
However, there are also variable payments, for which 337.8 million are planned.
This money is given in proportion to the value of each single television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 assigned places.
The master of last year receives 40% of the money allocated, 30% of the second, 20% of the third and 10% for fourth place.
The other part is distributed according to the number of games they play at this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group yesterday had details of the sale of shares that it wanted to acquire a ceiling of between 25 and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (Grandpa) because of the number of shares.
In real terms, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share paid out to ten years and with an interest rate of 1% per year due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos shares closed at 1.85 euros, so Nueva Rumasa assessed the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real assessment of sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Jeréz Group gives shareholders a period of 15 days to inform their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had come into contact with the Authority.
The deposit would amount to 611.7 million in the case of a final payment, while the value of Sos would be 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In the attempt to stay on the brink of possible sales and the judicial quarters of his ex-managers, the Jesús and Jaime Salazar brothers announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal audit.
A decision to make her the first woman to have a high position in the food business.
This is a newly created post, which is directly under the responsibility of the Group's chairman.
This is all but free from polemics because the company is involved in a court battle because of the suspicion of diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be ruled out that over the next few months, Sos will move further capital.
With regard to the loan of the Salazar, the ex-consultants Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaya) came to the National Assembly yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the shift of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves the public exclusion invitation to tender submitted by the investment company Mer for Paternina
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public exclusion invitation to tender submitted by the investment company Mer for Federico Paternina last October.
The supervisory authority stated that it approved this invitation to tender after it had been demonstrated that the conditions were in line with the laws of the law and, therefore, the content of the explanatory note submitted can be considered "sufficient" after the amendments of the previous 2 December.
CNMV has also announced that this offer is aimed at the acquisition of 5500.008 shares by Federico Paternina at the price of EUR 7.65 per share, which in turn is 8,95% of the share capital, which consists of EUR 6.142,786 in shares approved on the Madrid and Bilbao exchanges.
It has also been announced that 5,592,778 million shares have been established, which cannot be transferred in any way until the end of the tender and whose price has been fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the laws of the law.
New vehicle assessment programmes
In these days of weather and accidents, not only the KFZ workshops deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are dragged into the workshops where a verifier has to assess the damage caused and the costs of repair.
No accident is the same and the calculation of the costs of the parts and working hours can be a long and complicated task.
The calculation of the repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros per hand, including the parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools, it is a matter of minutes.
That is why almost 100% of the evaluators use this kind of system.
The service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repairs collect the information they receive from the manufacturers in order to process them and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful programme.
In Spain, Audtex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all opinions are produced with their products.
The other two companies competing with the tool market for review and preparation of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data that the manufacturers provide is anything but easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, the sales manager of Audtex, 63 manufacturers and importers are working together, each of them providing the information in a different format.
Moreover, the amount of data to be processed is becoming more and more, up to the point that more versions, variants and motorists have been on the market in the last five years than in the whole fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car comes on the market, the work starts for the companies.
It is a difficult task, because every single one of the Aberthousand parts of the vehicle must be catagolised and its price entered.
In addition, a "intelligent" graphic image is created by each model, on which you can "click on" different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much-sold model, work can be completed in a week if the procedure is in progress.
If this is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. At present, Audtex has complete information for 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the road vehicle park, it is more than 99%.
In order to carry out the documentation work and the production of databases, Audtex has eight centres distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters are in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audtex is investing 90 million euros a year in the development of these databases.
Every month they record 2.5 million data and their customers get the updates every second day.
The development of this enormous flow of information allows companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but there are also tools, depending on the country, for the management of scrap parts or for the calculation of the total or residual value of a car.
The only company that is informed about a guide about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audtex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
When looking at the products that Audtex offers, it is easy to get an overview of the type of support it gives to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the products AudaPlus, a standard solution to test accidents for the evaluators.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it contains the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint prices.
This tool is paid according to the purpose of use, i.e. for each opinion.
It will be the most expensive for customers who rarely use it, up to ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros a month.
On the other hand, any insurance company that produces thousands of opinions is negotiating the price with Audtex.
With other products, such as Audavin, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it was running from the assembly board only by means of the chassis number.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle discs, and AudaSubastas is an open service on the Internet for the specialist market, with which you can offer for vehicles that have been declared to be total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses or in obtaining information on the differences by brand and model.
For example, it is possible to examine how many models of a particular car brand had to go to the workshop due to the breaks or how many of them were involved in a serious accident during a certain period of time.
Gt Motives is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this kind of computer tools.
It sells, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for evaluators and in the same way provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, which was founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of vehicle damage, losses or maintenance.
The GT expert guide is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has increased by 20% per year over the last three years and sales amounted to 10.8 million euros in 2008.
At the beginning of last year they began to go on the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
= = History = = Audtex was founded in 1966 in Germany and was founded in 1979 in Spain.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is done in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The total turnover in the world of the Solera group (Audtex, Sidexa, Informx ABZ, Hollander and IMS) is 557 million dollars, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this country, the company has revenue of €19.1 million, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange and today its shares are traded at a value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007 they have been on the New York Stock Exchange and part of the reference index Standard & Poor's.
Auction of accident cars on the Internet
In October, the Solera Autoonline group bought a platform on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer more services and value-added to its customers, with the possibility of access to a huge international market.
This review and purchase service is exclusively for industry experts, such as insurance companies, accountants, car rental companies, workshops, scrap sites and car dealers, who have to register before their activities.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, of which 500,000 are in Germany alone.
Their main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website today has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 evaluators.
Every day, 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added on the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis number has been cancelled may no longer drive on the road, but certain undamaged parts may be used as spare parts.
The cars with historical value may, however, be re-registered, even if they have been unregistered after difficult administration.
estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audtex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in only four steps: identification of the vehicle, search of the spare part, creation and production of a cost estimate.
The easy handling of these systems is a basic condition, especially to convince the older professionals who are usually more or less against the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger vehicles, 109 road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 small vehicles and 44 trucks.
Of course you need a computer with internet connection for use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified using the chassis number, a graphic of the model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price for working hours, prices or discounts and then have the estimate printed out and passed on to his customers.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool for review such as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of use for this tool is 350 euros a year, an amount that the customer can easily pay.
The company Audtex is currently working to offer these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that car mechanics have been waiting for a long time for, for example, because you can select a door with it, and then you can completely turn the picture around to look at the inside.
